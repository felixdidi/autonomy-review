    "text": "Doc 1 :  Cyberspace Self-Governance: A Skeptical View from Democratic Theory \nhttps://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.175828\n Neil Weinstock Netanel \nThe idea that cyberspace should be presumptively self-governing has resounded in thoughtful scholarship. It has also precipitated the recent, dramatic withdrawal of the United States government from significant portions of Internet administration and regulation. This Article critiques a central prong of the argument for cyberspace self-governance: the claim that a self-governing cyberspace would more fully realize liberal democratic ideals than does nation-state representative democracy. That cyberian claim, in turn, has two parallel components: first, that the Internet creates possibilities for bottom-up private ordering that are a superior form of liberal democracy, and second, that a truly liberal nation-state must grant considerable autonomy to cyberspace communities. These claims of liberal perfectionism and community autonomy pose an intriguing challenge to traditional democratic theory. But I believe that they ultimately fail. I argue, indeed, that an untrammeled cyberspace would prove inimical to the ideals of liberal democracy. It would free majorities to trample upon minorities and would serve as a breeding ground for invidious status discrimination, narrow casting and mainstreaming content selection, systematic invasions of privacy, and gross inequalities in the distribution of basic requisites for citizenship in the information age. Accordingly, I argue, that selective state regulation of cyberspace is warranted to protect and promote liberal ideals. I maintain as well that in the absence of regulation by a democratic state, cyberians would be forced to try to invent a quasi-state institution to legislate and enforce meta-norms governing critical aspects of cyberspace organization and operation. Even if cyberians were successfully to establish such an institution, it would, at best, suffer from much the same democratic deficit as, according to cyberians, characterizes nation-state representative democracy."

Until recently, most information was scattered, disorganized and awkward to find then acquire. Google was one of the first to realize how digital technology changed that by encoding information as 1s and 0s. Googleâ€™s corporate mission is to organise the worldâ€™s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Facebookâ€™s mission is to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.Â  The relations between Google, Facebook and other social spheres on the internet emphasize their â€˜relative autonomy.â€™ The intuition behind the â€˜relative autonomyâ€™ formula is that they are neither wholly independent of, nor entirely reducible to, political, legal, economic and other social processes. This article examines the relation between Google, Facebook and other social spheres. The theory examined will be Niklas Luhmannâ€™s theory of â€˜autopoiesis.â€™ This article presents autopoietic theory with particular attention to the way in which Luhmann reformulates the â€˜relative autonomyâ€™ problem. Throughout, the article focuses on the connections between autopoietic theory and issues of Google, Facebook and contemporary legal theory."

Innovation is gone from exploitation to exploration of the long tail, towards the emergence of non-profit or for-profit knowledge intensive service suppliers (KISS) allowing ‘prosumers’ to find solutions to run themselves their activities, through users generated resources. The growing autonomy of the tail from the head of distribution in the tourism industry emerges with the development of a platform economy, i.e., of global innovative market places inside the long tail itself."

Community-based medical education can partly address these needs and can serve to introduce students to a number of community health problems. Climate change has the potential to produce major challenges for health and food security in South Asia. Medical students should be taught about climate change and methods to tackle its impact on health. The pharmaceutical industry in South Asia aggressively promotes their products. Disease mongering is becoming more common in South Asia. Educational initiatives to sensitize students regarding promotion are common in developed countries. In Nepal, an educational initiative critically looks at the industry’s promotional tactics. Similar initiatives are required in other medical schools. The nature of the doctor-patient relationship is changing. An increasing demand for patient autonomy and for their involvement in therapeutic decisions is seen. Access to the internet and internet sources of health information is increasing. Medical schools should address these issues as well. Medical Humanities modules and courses in communication skills are required. Research can play an important role in alleviating the health problems of South Asia. Students should be taught the basics of scientific research and student research should be strongly encouraged."

    "text": "Doc 6 :  Persisting Effects of Internet Skills on Online Participation \nhttps://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2418033\n Eszter Hargittai \n Sabrina Connell \n Erin Klawitter \n Eden Litt \nMillions of people contribute to online content daily, allowing them to share their ideas and influence public conversations. Some have attached much enthusiasm and hope to such activities as they may result in a variety of benefits, including cultural empowerment, engagement with the political process, and collective knowledge production. While these considerations cast the Internet as a potentially equalizing platform, research has shown that certain groups of people are more likely to participate in such online activities than others. All existing research on this topic has relied on cross-sectional data, making it impossible to make causal arguments about what results in more or less online engagement. That is, while research has found, for example, that Internet skills are related to online participation, the cross-sectional nature of the data makes it difficult for scholars to disentangle the causal effect between the two variables, that is, whether higher skills result in more participation or whether more participation leads to higher skills, or both. In this paper, we draw on a unique panel survey data set that includes data about the same 547 young adults from 2009 and 2012 to address these questions. We consider how demographic factors, socioeconomic status as well as various Internet experiences such as veteran status, frequency of use, autonomy of use, self-efficacy and Internet skills may influence people’s participation online, from editing Wikipedia to taking part in online forum discussions, posting reviews and voting on others’ content. We find that far from being universal, only a small portion of respondents have ever participated in several of these types of online activities, and some have never engaged in any of them. Despite the study’s focus on young adults who have grown up with digital media, not only is participation not universal, there are systematic differences in the types of people who are more or less likely to participate. We show that young adults with higher levels of Web-use skills are more likely to engage in various online production activities than their less-skilled counterparts. In particular, those from more privileged backgrounds, i.e., whose parents have higher levels of education, are more likely to contribute their voices to online conversations. This paper makes a special contribution to the growing literature on Internet skills by examining how three different measures of this concept relate to online engagement. We look at a universal Internet skills measure, we include a measure of Internet self-efficacy, and we test the effect of a more nuanced measure of Web-use skills. We find that self-efficacy and skill have independent effects on the outcome of online engagement suggesting that research on people’s online know-how should not collapse these conceptually different variables. The paper ends with the policy implications of the findings for achieving a universally empowered Internet citizenry. Findings suggest that simply having grown up with digital media does not result in either universal know-how about the Internet nor universal online engagement suggesting that interventions are important to make sure that people from all backgrounds have the necessary skills to take advantage of all that the Internet has to offer."

Thus, this research uses quantitative analysis to determine the perception of presence and intensity level of fourteen technological paradoxes related to the use of smartphone by professionals in Brazil. Besides, this study identifies the variables that impact the perception of each paradox associated with the use of smartphone by professionals. Data analysis shows that the paradox autonomy vs. addiction is perceived by more than 85% of those who responded to the survey. The study also results in a paradoxes ranking regarding the strength of the paradoxes. This ranking has the following paradoxes in the top positions: autonomy vs. addiction, engagement vs. disengagement, and freedom vs. enslavement, respectively. Finally, an ordinal logistic regression is run, leading to the conclusion that only two of the fourteen paradoxes are influenced by some of the independent variables of the model."

We compared two groups of Japanese university students who were either prohibited from using their smartphones in the classroom, or encouraged to use them for academic purposes, examining whether those using smartphones in their EFL lessons would show a tendency toward being autonomous. The results indicated that students who were encouraged to use their smartphones during class were inclined to study more in their free time as well as show signs of autonomy by taking charge of their learning and consider ways to improve their own study habits and English proficiency. Our conclusion is that language teachers and learners should be encouraged to use smartphones in the classroom as a means of fueling the desire to learn."

The focus is gradually shifting from partial to full autonomy with the possibility of self-driving cars on the author’s roads becoming an absolute reality. This is an important transformation, as vehicular controls start to critically rely on a range of sensing and communication systems. Such dependencies also make vehicular platforms vulnerable to a multitude of cyber security threats, which have the potential to disrupt and damage vehicles alongside endangering driver and passenger safety, with only nascent security controls (derived, in the main, from safety techniques) to prevent or mitigate these dangers. This article critically examines some such threats and reviews the state-of-the-art of controls and countermeasures to counter such threats."

Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are central to this vision and are entitled to be part of smart machines, storage systems and production facilities able to exchange information with autonomy and intelligence. Such systems should be able to decide and trigger actions, and control each other independently and for such reason it is required the use of Knowledge based and intelligent information approaches. In this paper we present our perspective on how to support Industrie 4.0 with Knowledge based and intelligent systems. We focus in the conceptual model, architecture and necessary elements we believe are required for a real world implementation. We base our conceptualization in the experiences gathered during the participation in different ongoing research projects where the presented architecture is being implemented."

It is argued that important ethical aspects of the clinical interaction, such as dialogue and trust will be difficult to realise in an Internet-consultation. Further, it is doubtful whether an Internet doctor will accept responsibility. However, medical information via the Internet can be a valuable resource for patients wanting to know more about their disease and, thus, it is a means to enhancing their autonomy."

Using the cybernetic approach, proposed by Gregory Bateson in social anthropology, we describe the circular logic of interaction between genders and study the strategies that Evenki use to solve contradictions between personal autonomy ( manakan ) and dependencies associated with inter-gender relationships. The scope of our interest covers such situations as flirting, conjugal unit establishment, promotion of business contacts with strangers ( andaki relationships), everyday violence and aggression, as well as ecstatic states. The presented analysis of the episodes of interaction in everyday life shows that Evenki social organization is based on a situational approach to the distinction of genders. The research is based on several fieldworks conducted in the Baikal region (Russia), but the core materials relate to a two-month stay with one Evenki community in spring 2006."

The commoditization of health and the ideology of biomedicine affects social life in creating dependency, social control, and vast inequalities. At the same time, increased access and diversity of consumer health knowledge as evidenced by the use of the Internet and the sharp rise in alternative medicine point to a different dialectic between doctor and patient and the potential for transforming diagnostic, treatment, and economic components of health care. Recent trends suggest increasing patient autonomy and the possibility of a re-emergence of medical pluralism. New theoretical directions should be considered by social scientists in order to more fully understand these changes."

PlantingScience (PS), an ideal curriculum for use as an NGSS model, is a computer-mediated collaborative learning environment intertwining scientific inquiry, classroom instruction, and online mentoring from scientists. With implementation in hundreds of classrooms across the United States, science teachers have noted PS as successful in motivating their students to engage in classroom inquiry investigations. To investigate the role of the online scientist-mentors in motivating students in the PS learning environment, we used self-determination theory (SDT) to guide a multiple case study of 10 student inquiry teams engaged in PS in a rural public school in a large Southwestern U.S. state. We used online dialogues between scientist-mentors and their assigned student inquiry teams to answer research questions about the motivational support provided by scientist-mentors and the association between this support and students’ engagement in scientific inquiry. Analyses revealed a general relationship between scientist-mentor motivational support and student inquiry engagement. Differences were observed in the specific ways in which scientists supported autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Student inquiry engagement corresponded to high support in relatedness, whereas correspondence with autonomy support was low."

Indeed, as frequently recited, the increased protection of children by monitoring them is a central characteristic of modern childhood (Rasmussen, 2003; Qvortrup, 1993) and the effects of this are not yet know. Equally our understanding of how children in middle childhood (8 – 12 years) negotiate and or resist this monitoring is unclear. This paper seeks to add to the emerging body of knowledge on the strategies employed by children in middle childhood to negotiate and resist the monitoring and surveillance of their physical selves in time and space using mobile phones. I suggest that the mobile phone can be transformed by children into a highly efficient device to enable them to both negotiate and resist surveillance thus increasing their autonomy and independent mobility. Children are not passive recipients of parental surveillance and power, rather they are increasingly playing an active role in negotiation with parents and actively resist monitoring of their everyday lives to both make meaning anew and produce culture."

Wright \nSociological accounts of the literary field emphasise the ways it is institutionally shaped and how actors within it make claims to cultural authority. These accounts include consideration of reviewing as a social or institutional practice and the role of literary prizes in the production and management of esteem. Much of this research draws on the work of Pierre Bourdieu as an inspiration, particularly around notions of cultural capital, disinterestedness and autonomy. Recent research into such phenomena as Oprah’s Book Club in the US has demonstrated the complexities and ambiguities of cultural authority in the light of mass forms of participation and access. This paper uses the recent phenomenon of The Big Read – a television and internet based search for ‘the nation’s favourite books’ broadcast in 2003 – to examine persistent and emerging forms of cultural authority in the light of these debates. By exploring the processes of book selection, the type of books selected and drawing on a textual analysis of the television programmes covering ‘the top 21’ favourite books, the paper examines the different ways in which questions of value in the literary field were addressed and negotiated. The paper concludes by suggesting the need for a modification of the Bourdieusian perspective on cultural authority in understanding the contemporary literary field."

Educators can find a wide assortment of materials for learners to study in class or after class for independent learning and to encourage learner autonomy. More recently, however, the immense popularity of social networking websites has created new opportunities for language learners to interact in authentic ways that were previously difficult to achieve. Advances in technology mean that today, learners of a language can easily interact with their peers in meaningful practice that helps foster language acquisition and motivation. That is, tasks that make use of Web 2.0 interactivity can significantly raise students’ potential to generate meaningful output and stimulate their interest in language learning."

    "text": "Doc 20 :  The Illusory Right to Abandon \nhttps://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/journal_articles/6888/\n Eduardo M. Penalver \nThe unilateral and unqualified nature of the right to abandon (at least as it is usually described) appears to make it a robust example of the law’s concern to safeguard the individual autonomy interests that many contemporary commentators have identified as lying at the heart of the concept of private ownership. The doctrine suppos edly empowers owners of chattels freely and unilaterally to abandon them by manifesting the clear intent to do so, typically by renouncing possession of the object in a way that communicates the intent to forgo any future claim to it. A complication immediately arises, however, due to the common law’s traditional prohibition of the abandonment of land. But the problem goes even deeper. Viewed through the lens of land, the (prospective) right to abandon virtu ally any form of tangible property, even chattels, is an illusion. This is because the legal prohibition of abandoning land dramatically qualifies the unilateral right to abandon chattels to the point of in significance. The common law’s treatment of land is not an anomalous restriction within a legal regime that otherwise empow ers owners to freely abandon their property. Instead, the inability to abandon land forms the foundation of a system that, among other things, helps regulate and direct the disposition of unwanted chat tels by requiring those seeking to sever their bonds of ownership to do so in cooperation with others. Instead of asking why the com mon law treats land differently from chattels, the more appropriate question to ask is why the common law exhibits such suspicion of abandonment as a whole. Approaching the discussion of abandon ment from this perspective points towards connections between the common law of property and conceptions of ownership that view the latter as a social practice suffused with obligation and duty."

From the discussions around kitchen tables that led to the dismantling of the Soviet bloc to the more recent emergence of Internet initiatives like MoveOn.org and Redeem the Vote that are revolutionizing the American political landscape, consequential political life develops in small spaces where dialogue generates political power. In The Politics of Small Things, Jeffrey C. Goldfarb provides an innovative way for understanding politics, a way of appreciating the significance of politics at the micro level by comparatively analyzing key turning points and institutions in recent history. He presents a sociology of human interactions that lead from small to large: dissent around the old Soviet bloc; life on the streets in Warsaw, Prague, and Bucharest in 1989; the network of terror that spawned 9/11; and the religious and Internet mobilizations that transformed the 2004 presidential election, to name a few. In such pivotal moments, he masterfully shows, political autonomy can be generated, presenting alternatives to the big politics of the global stage and the dominant narratives of terrorism, antiterrorism, and globalization."

In this paper, I distinguish six different senses of ’responsible‘ and then consider in which of these senses computers can, and in which they cannot, be said to be ’’responsible‘‘ for ’’deciding‘‘ various outcomes. I sort out and explore two different kinds of complaint against putting computers in greater ’’control‘‘ of our lives: (i) as finite and fallible human beings, there is a limit to how far we can acheive increased reliability through complex devices of our own design; (ii) even when computers are more reliable than humans, certain tasks (e.g., selecting an appropriate gift for a friend, solving the daily crossword puzzle) are inappropriately performed by anyone (or anything) other than oneself. In critically evaluating these claims, I arrive at three main conclusions: (1) While we ought to correct for many of our shortcomings by availing ourselves of the computer‘s larger memory, faster processing speed and greater stamina, we are limited by our own finiteness and fallibility (rather than by whatever limitations may be inherent in silicon and metal) in the ability to transcend our own unreliability. Moreover, if we rely on programmed computers to such an extent that we lose touch with the human experience and insight that formed the basis for their programming design, our fallibility is magnified rather than mitigated. (2) Autonomous moral agents can reasonably defer to greater expertise, whether human or cybernetic. But they cannot reasonably relinquish ’’background-oversight‘‘ responsibility. They must be prepared, at least periodically, to review whether the ’’expertise‘‘ to which they defer is indeed functioning as he/she/it was authorized to do, and to take steps to revoke that authority, if necessary. (3) Though outcomes matter, it can also matter how they are brought about, and by whom. Thus, reflecting on how much of our lives should be directed and implemented by computer may be another way of testing any thoroughly end-state or consequentialist conception of the good and decent life. To live with meaning and purpose, we need to actively engage our own faculties and empathetically connect up with, and resonate to, others. Thus there is some limit to how much of life can be appropriately lived by anyone (or anything) other than ourselves."

In the process, it exposes many illusory responses to globalisation. The essays published here on the contradictions that have been undermining the Swedish, Rhineland and East Asian ‘models’ go far towards showing how vacuous are the currently fashionable proposals for a ‘third way’ (even those advanced in Cuba). But it is not only the crisis of all models implicated in globalisation that concerns us here. The essays in this volume also reveal the shallowness and growing instability of the ‘democracy’ peddled and often put in place by global capitalism’s ideologues and state functionaries from Latin America to Russia. That it was always a serious error to take East Asia as offering a model of any kind was very clear long before the economic cataclysm that has now engulfed that region. But even in the core capitalist countries, as several of the essays here also show, democracy is increasingly thin, the public sphere and the autonomy of the state having been drastically curtailed by market forces, and the social democratic parties having been hollowed out by the very political elites who pretend that their ‘third way’ is a solution to, rather than a symptom of, the crisis of the left. Yet there is no easy way forward. Among the obstacles examined by the contributors to this volume are, for example, the western working classes’ complex implication in globalisation through their pension funds as well as through trade union support for ‘progressive competitiveness’, and the readiness of some left intellectuals to embrace the idea of a new non-material ‘cyber-economy’. Many such problems will have to be confronted and overcome before effective movements able to challenge and transcend the forces that have brought us globalisation will be able to emerge and develop strategies, not only for democratising the economy and the state, but for reconstructing a public sphere where socialist voices can once again be heard. Such movements will need to discover how to make democracy simultaneously meaningful and effective at the local, national and global levels, not least by building new linkages between these levels."

The Role of Identity Autonomy and Public Regard in Depressive Symptoms \nhttps://doi.org/10.1111/j.1559-1816.2010.00634.x\n Diana T. Sanchez \nThe present study reports on correlational data gathered from an Internet survey to explore why forced-choice dilemma situations relate to depressive symptoms among multiracial people (N = 317). Specifically, a model was tested that explored the role of identity autonomy (the extent to which multiracial people feel they can racially identify however they desire) and public regard (the extent to which multiracial people think others value their multiracial identity). The results of the model suggest that forced-choice dilemmas predict greater depressive symptoms because forcedchoice dilemmas may promote greater beliefs that their multiracial identity is devalued in society and more generally restrict identity autonomy. Implications are discussed in terms of multiracial health and public policies regarding assessments of racial identities. jasp_634 1657..1677 Researchers widely accept that people of multiracial heritage face unique challenges associated with their membership in multiple racial categories. These unique challenges have been proposed as precipitating factors in racial identity development, overall psychological health, and the occurrence of problem behaviors, including poor academic performance among multiracial people (Gillem, Cohn, & Throne, 2001; Logan, 1981; Rockquemore & Brunsma, 2002a, 2002b; Shih & Sanchez, 2005). In a review of work on multiracial health, Shih and Sanchez proposed that forced-choice dilemmas may contribute to multiracial people’s psychological well-being. Thus, the present study is designed to examine empirically the possible link between self-reported experiences of forced-choice dilemmas and psychological wellbeing, as well as the mechanisms that may account for the relationship. Forced-choice dilemmas refer to situations in which multiracial people are asked or pressured to choose between their multiple racial identities, rather than being allowed to identify with their multiple racial identities (Standen, 1996). Because of the difficulties multiracial people face, many theorists have erroneously predicted that multiracial people will exhibit worse"

But at the same time these new means of gathering information may pose powerful threats to privacy, autonomy, and informed consent. Online research, particularly involving children and minors but also other vulnerable groups such as ethnic or religious minorities, is in urgent need of an adequate research ethics that can provide reasonable and morally justified constraints for human subjects research. The paper at hand seeks to provide some clarification of these new means of information gathering and the challenges they present to moral concepts like privacy, autonomy, informed consent, beneficence, and justice. Some existing codes of conduct and ethical guidelines are examined to determine whether they provide answers to those challenges and/or whether they can be helpful in the development of principles and regulations governing human subjects research. Finally, some conclusions and recommendations are presented that can help in the task of formulating an adequate research ethics for human subjects research."

Computer-assisted language learning and computer mediated communication (CMC) appear to be particularly conducive to fostering autonomous learning, as they naturally incorporate many elements of autonomy that give learners control over and responsibility for their own learning, such as choosing the materials used, managing their contact with various genres and types of interaction, often in authentic contexts, and evaluating their own progress, measured through their success in understanding and conveying meanings. However, providing access to language resources does not automatically lead to the development of autonomy, as much depends on other factors, such as the learners’ level or previous experience in learner training. The present study investigated whether advanced learners of English made use of out-of-class CMC engagement for the purpose of learning English autonomously. The results indicate that most of the participants were eager to use CMC opportunities to deliberately practice their English, although, quite naturally, leisure and social reasons for using CMC predominated. The expressed willingness to deliberately focus on practicing English during beyond-theclassroom meaning-oriented online interactions confirms the great potential of CMC as an autonomy enhancement tool."

Henry \n Deirdre Cobb-Roberts \n Sherman Dorn \n Herbert A. Exum \n Harold Keller \n Barbara J. Shircliffe \nThis case study explains varied perspectives on a difficult dialogue. It provides recommendations for student affairs professionals and faculty members who work with students and teach courses in content areas that are related to diversity, social justice, and privilege. Educators who prepare multiculturally competent students use a variety of methods to accomplish this task. Regardless of the method, however, achieving multicultural competence inevitably involves difficult dialogues regarding race, religion, and sexual orientation. This article presents an actual case describing what happened when a difficult dialogue about race took place in a classroom setting. Student development theory including Helm’s (1990) White Identity Development model, Perry’s (1970) Scheme and Watt’s (2007) Privileged Identity Exploration (PIE) model are used to provide a theoretical framework in case analysis to discuss the involved parties’ behavior. Helms (1990) contends that Whites are innately benefactors of racism. Thus, she proposed a White racial identity development model designed to assist Whites in the process of adopting a nonracist White identity; for this to happen, Whites must abandon personal racism as well as recognize and actively renounce institutional and cultural racism. Phase I of the model Abandonment of Racism has three statuses: (1) Contact, (2) Disintegration and (3) Reintegration. Phase II - Defining a Nonracist White Identity also has three statuses: (1) Pseudo-Independence (2) Immersion-Emersion and (3) Autonomy (see Helms, 1990). Perry’s (1970) Scheme of Cognitive and Ethical Development consists of nine positions which students move through with respect to intellectual and moral development. These stages are characterized in terms of the student’s attitude towards knowledge and are grouped into four categories: Dualism, Multiplicity, Relativism and Commitment (see Perry, 1970). Watt’s Privileged Identity Exploration (PIE) Model consists of eight defensive reactions, motivated by fear and entidement, when one encounters difficult dialogue. These defensive reactions are grouped under three categories: Category I -Recognizing Privilege Identity has three defense modes (1) denial, (2) deflection, and (3) rationalisation. Category II Contemplating privileged Identity consists of (1) intellectualisation, (2) principium and (3) false envy. Category III-Addressing Privileged Identity includes (1) Benevolence and (2) Minimisation (Watt, 2007). Collectively, these theories focus on cognitive and affective as well as behavioral changes in college students (and others), and encourage student affairs practitioners and faculty members to explore creative and collaborative methods for reducing oppressive actions in the classroom and on campus. Below the case will be presented and then analyzed using the aforementioned developmental theories. The article will conclude with practical applications for student affairs professionals and faculty members. The Case (The names in the following case are pseudonyms) Dominique Stephens is an African American associate professor who has taught diversity related graduate courses in a predominately White institution for nearly a decade. She is keenly aware of how racism shapes students’, particularly White students’, reactions and responses to her as a teacher and to her as an expert on how race informs college student affairs practice. Yet, she was surprised and frustrated by the events she endured one semester while teaching the Diversity in Education course. After attending a few classes, a White male student, Kent Peterson, contacted Professor Stephens via email, indicating his discomfort with her course and the comments she and his fellow students made about race and racism. She invited Mr. Peterson to meet with her to discuss his concerns. Instead, Mr. Peterson sent another email, which he copied to her department chair, stating that the classroom environment was hostile to White males and that he was uncertain about returning to class. …"

The problem of such solutions centers not only in network deployment and its maintenance, but also in the equipment installation on clients, which always has big costs. This installation and configuration must be performed by a technician on site, so that the equipment can be integrated in the infrastructure. To try to mitigate this problem, it is presented a solution that allows the clients to install, with transparency, the device at home, reducing not only the cost for the management entity but also for the clients. This way, for info-excluded people or with new technology low experience level, it is the user that integrates himself in the network, making him part of the process, fostering the network usage. In this article are specified not only the system architecture but also the way that it works and how it obtains the desirable result. The tests made to the solution show the quickness, reliability and autonomy in the execution of the tasks, making it a benefit for rural wireless networks.

While some consider SNS a distraction, others consider them a tool for professional socialisation and that recreational access positively impacts satisfaction. This exploratory study reports results from an online survey of employees from one faculty of an Australian university, exploring how they used Facebook at work and how they would react to a hypothetical Facebook ban. Three-quarters of respondents used Facebook at work, primarily for personal socialisation during breaks. Many self-imposed a strict personal/professional separation, but opposed a hypothetical SNS ban, perceiving it as an infringement on their workplace autonomy. It is argued that university employees - academic and professional - can be trusted to self-regulate access."

Dee \n Cheryl J. Daly \nI. Introduction Faculty members have been described as purveyors of culture, engines of economic development, and generators of scientific, medical, and technological discoveries that transform human society (Schuster & Finkelstein, 2006). They have been characterized as institutional agents who can foster the development of social and cultural capital, particularly within and among historically disadvantaged communities (Stanton-Salazar, 1997). Faculty have been at the forefront of social change movements, and have been viewed as teachers and mentors who can empower students to achieve their highest potential (Kingston-Mann & Sieber, 2001). But faculty have also been described, by critics, as scam artists who focus on self-interested agendas at the expense of the education of tuition-paying students (Sykes, 1988). Collectively, faculties and their academic disciplines have been defined by some postmodernists as closed communities that endorse only certain forms of knowledge generation, primarily those forms that reinforce the power positions of well-established interests within those disciplines (Foucault, 1986). Recently, faculty have been characterized as managed professionals, whose autonomy has been eroded by extensive accountability-oriented measurement systems (Rhoades, 1998) and by a rising managerialism among college and university administrators, who now are more likely to make major decisions without faculty input (Bess, 2006). These various images and metaphors suggest that expectations for the academic profession have become highly differentiated and fragmented. No longer does a quick reference to teaching, research, and service suffice to explain the work of the faculty member. Faculty roles have become increasingly complex and challenging, both for individuals to carry out and for institutions to support. Despite the multitude of images and descriptors associated with academic work, one commonality is that faculty members are people who have human needs for growth, achievement, satisfaction, and connection with others (Deci & Ryan, 2000). Faculty development programs can play an important role on college and university campuses by acknowledging the human needs of faculty members, and by providing the resources, social networks, and innovative ideas that can foster the fulfillment of those needs. This paper reports on an innovative faculty development program that focused its energies on the idea that fulfilling the human needs of faculty members is an essential prerequisite for ongoing growth and success within the academic profession. Many faculty development programs are organized around meeting functional needs, rather than human needs. These programs, many based in centers for teaching and learning, focus on the functional roles that faculty perform, and attempt to identify key areas within those functions that present unique challenges for faculty (e.g., teaching with technology or assessing students’ writing). These functional needs are sometimes identified systematically through a survey of faculty members, but more often the needs are identified by a faculty committee, or by an academic administrator charged with responsibilities for faculty development (Sorcinelli, Austin, Eddy, & Beach, 2006). Once the functional needs have been identified, programs and services are designed to identify and convey a set of skills that can be used to improve performance within a given function (Akerlind, 2005). The programs may be tailored to fit the needs of particular faculty groups, such as junior faculty or discipline-specific issues (e.g., teaching large lecture courses in the sciences). Although these programs may acknowledge different needs by career stage and by academic discipline, they typically are not organized around foundational human needs. The goal of many of these faculty development programs is to teach faculty, for example, how to use technology or how to assess students’ writing, rather than to fulfill faculty members’ needs for growth, achievement, and collegial connection. …"

Relations between work characteristics and the estimated work ability Gedrag & Organisatie, volume 24, November 2011, nr. 4, pp. 392-410.The Dutch and Belgian government attempts to let employees work longer with financial measures in order to solve the threatening shortness of labor forces. Until today this approach seems to be less successful. For this reason this study investigated, within the frame of the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model, whether the job characteristics workload, emotional and physical demands, cognitive demands, learning opportunities, autonomy and relation with the supervisor are related to someone’s expectation to be able to continue his job until the pension age. This study found several new practical and theoretical insights. It turned out that there were significant relations for workload, emotional and physical demands, learning opportunities and autonomy with someone’s expectation to be able to continue his job until the pension age. Psychological exhaustion as well as work pleasure had a mediating role in these relations. Using multiple mediation model analysis the research model was tested on the data of 2107 employees of 50 year or older of the Flemish Workability Monitor 2007."

This study empirically assesses perceptions of the financial planning professional to find those factors seen to be most important and least important contributing to financial planner self reported success. The data utilized within this study were gathered via a survey instrument developed and administered in an online format during the months of June and July 2008. A total of 403 geographically diverse respondents (4% response rate) who are members of the FPA and agree to receive email from the organization answered the survey. The final sample used after significant non-response cases were eliminated was 349 respondents (3.5%). Findings of this study indicate that client relationships, wealth of client served, use of ethical practices, ability to empathize, number of clients served, client referrals, and job autonomy are among the most important contributors to financial planner perceived success. (ProQuest: … denotes formula omitted.) INTRODUCTION The financial planning profession provides a unique research opportunity for scholars and practitioners alike. Little if any empirical research has been conducted to this point conceptualizing and evaluating career success dimensions within financial planning. Career success dimensions such as client management, client demographic, personal, job scope, and business practice factors will provide further insight into the perceptions of the financial planner, their job functions, and their self reported level of success. The purpose of this research is to analyze perceptions of these factors and to evaluate which factors are perceived to contribute most to the financial planner. Research within financial planning enhances the opportunity for working world solutions to be developed for the benefit of the profession and those who work daily as financial planners. LITERATURE REVIEW In the 1950’ s, noted social psychologist Fritz Heider developed a theory explaining how individuals attribute behavior of themselves and others. Heider’ s work, known as attribution theory, is a cognitive theory associated with success and interpersonal relationships (Heider, 1958). Attribution theory is the exploration of an individual’s awareness of cause and effect scenarios and how the outcomes of such scenarios affect the individual’s perception of usefulness. Heider proposed that people strive for prediction and understanding of daily events in order to give their lives stability and predictability (Heider). Fullin and Mills (1995) write of attribution theory as applied to the field of sports, whereby athletes use awareness of cause and effect scenarios to adjust performance output. Attribution theory divides the way an individual attributes causes to events into two distinct categories: external and internal. External attribution assigns causality to an outside factor, such as client demographics or job qualities, in the current study, or competition in the sports analogy. Internal attribution assigns causality to inside factors of the person, such as personal factors and business practices in the current study, or ability and luck in the sports analogy. Thus, when one measures his or herself or compares his or herself to others, attribution theory is engaged by way of comparison. One may make these comparisons and attribute differences to either internal or external deficiencies. Once the deficiencies are known, the individual can adjust the internal or external factors to attain a desired state. In the case of an athlete, once deficiencies are known, adjustments to ability, effort, and task difficulty can be made. Mittra, Potts, and LaBrecque (2005) argue the financial planner is at times like a football quarterback moderating the plays of financial life around the key planning areas in a strategic manner. …"

    "text": "Doc 37 :  Intercountry adoption: a global problem or a global solution? \nhttps://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/intercountry-adoption-a-global-problem-or-a-global-solution\n Judith M Masson \nUS is unique amongst developed states in preferring private adoption, a position that Katz associates with the American bias towards market mechanisms and preference for individual autonomy over state regulation. Adoption involves the legal, permanent transfer of a child from the birth parent or parents to new caregivers. In intercountry adoption, this transfer occurs across an international border. The child usually moves to a new country, to parents of different race, culture and language from the birth family, and acquires a new nationality. The child’s new identity replaces his or her original one. Adoption, therefore, it is appropriate to say involves losses as well as gains. This paper examines the use of intercountry adoption to provide for children in the most disadvantaged conditions. It discusses whether and how international legal instruments and domestic measures can combine to ensure proper standards are applied to such adoptions. (1) In doing so it accepts that intercountry adoption can and should be regulated, rejecting both the alternatives of a free market and a complete ban on adoption. The paper argues that regulatory standards, particularly the control of private adoptions, are required to ensure that abuses such as abduction and trafficking of children are eliminated. Also, as a child welfare measure that has the potential to compromise the human rights of both birth parents and children, adoption should only be used where it is appropriate to the child’s situation. Adoption is known to make psychological demands on the parties beyond those of natural parenthood. For this reason, the paper proposes that research knowledge and experience should be applied so that the arrangements made provide the best chance for stable, long-term relationships for children who have been adopted. (2) ORIGINS OF INTERCOUNTRY ADOPTION Intercountry adoption came about largely as an altruistic response to the plight of war orphans and the abandoned children of servicemen in World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. It now involves the transfer of more than 30,000 children each year from over 50 countries. (3) With few exceptions, children move from poor countries to wealthy ones. (4) In the main receiving countries–the United States, Canada and most countries of Western Europe–the number of such adoptions has doubled over the last decade. Many factors have contributed to this increase. In receiving countries, the decline in fertility associated with postponing marriage, the limited success and high cost of infertility treatment and a lack of domestic adoption opportunities have made intercountry adoption an alternative to childlessness. Intercountry adoption has also become easier as information about how it can be achieved has become more readily available, most recently via the Internet. In states of origin (sending countries), extreme poverty, lack of contraception and attitudes to birth outside of marriage are three major factors leading to the abandonment of children to institutions. (5) In Eastern Europe, social and economic collapse following the end of communist regimes left orphanages close to destitution. Those responsible for these institutions, the welfare organizations that support them and would-be parents in other countries, have all seen intercountry adoption as a solution. In China, the one-child policy and the cultural preference for boys have led to the abandonment of large numbers of girls to under-funded and inadequate institutions. In response to these phenomena, organizations have sprung up to facilitate intercountry adoption. For many of these agencies, acting as an intermediary has become a business. Because of the increase in international adoptions, a new legal regime has been developed. In 1993, the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption was signed to create an international framework for arranging and formalizing these adoptions and to prevent abuses. …"

Methods: Six separate binary logistic regression models were built to explore associations of problematic internet use (PIU), binge drinking and smoking for boys and girls (807 students, 75% females, 19.6 mean age) with personality variables (Plasticity, Stability), autonomy (awareness of self), religion (importance & attendance). Findings: The individual models revealed that PIU was associated with Plasticity and autonomy for both genders and with Stability for boys. Binge drinking was associated with Plasticity for both genders, with importance of religion for boys and attendance for girls. Smoking was associated with Plasticity for both genders, with autonomy for boys and Stability and religious attendance for girls. Discussion: A higher level of Plasticity seems to be generally associated with RBs while Stability, autonomy and religion, although differently for each gender, is protective. This distinction may be an important aspect of prevention programs."

As a response to these pressures, a strong international reform agenda has found support around the ideas that benefit recipients have to be “activated” in order to find Jobs. Such approaches conceive the aim of welfare states to strengthen Social Policy as a productive factor and to provide the “right” incentives and compulsion (carrots and sticks) in order to control and design behaviour of persons (van Berkel, 2010; Handler, 2004). On an ideological level, these developments correspond to a shift from previously contested assumptions about human motivation, choice, agency and human responsibility of beneficaries of the welfare state. In Critical Social Policy research, a discussion has emerged around the models of human motivation and agency that have been influential in policy design (see e.g. Le Grand, 2003; Deacon, 2005; White, 2013). The article argues that conceptions of human agency have important political implications when it comes to debates about individual responsibility. This may lead to so called “autonomy gaps” (Anderson, 2009), or to situations in which welfare beneficaries perceive the instituionalized imperative to autonomy as an injunction. The article confronts the capability approach (C.A.) to different competing sociological conceptions of human agency. On the basis of an empirical study of the construction of welfare subjects through activation policies, the article points to some shortcomings of the C.A. especially for the analysis of the micro-workings of power in post-disciplinary societies, in which the exercise of power does not so much consist of imposing direct constraints upon citizens as of “governing trough freedom”. For this reason, the article argues that Sen’s realization-based approach needs to be supplemented by concepts which allow accounting for the social mediatedness of individual identities and for the social construction of subjectivity within different social contexts."

Criminal courts face unique challenges maintaining the integrity of the criminal adjudicatory process while balancing the competing interests of moving cases efficiently through the system, respecting defendant autonomy and honoring due process. Holding pro se litigants to the same standards as attorneys, just one of the challenges inherent in allowing pro se defendant representation, can prove difficult because defendants often lack the necessary education, experience and social knowledge about how a courtroom works. As the pro se movement shows no signs of decreasing, courts must make an effort to accommodate these defendants with a plan that addresses court efficiency, autonomy and judicial process integrity concerns. Scholars generally agree that providing pro se defendants with a “road map, a passive tool, [that] lets them competently exercise their own route” can address many of the issues courts encounter when pro se defendants enter the system. Previous scholars have suggested potential solutions that could come from courts, non-profit organizations, or even law offices. One scholar has argued that the middle class has a significant unmet legal need in civil litigation cases and that social media might be the key to facilitating access to justice. This paper will take these arguments further and apply them to criminal court cases, highlighting unique considerations of the criminal justice process. This paper will address both how courts can use social media to assist pro se criminal defendants and why doing so improves individual and community relationships with the courts and furthers procedural justice goals. This paper proposes a Social Media Toolkit provided and overseen by a community’s local court that allows pro se defendants to interact with court staff and to access informational videos that will assist them in resolving their cases. As the influence and pervasiveness of social media increases, many organizations and businesses have implemented strategies to reach out online to the communities they once served exclusively in person. State courts are no exception. Some state courts have implemented parts of the proposed toolkit. This paper will discuss those examples and advocate for increased social media engagement in communities where it is absent."

This paper examines how e-portfolios take up these formative roles to support productive learning. Qualitative findings from interviews with selected first-year undergraduate students at a higher education institution in Hong Kong are reported concerning students’ experiences of constructing e-portfolios as assessment tasks. As part of an institutional teaching and learning initiative, e-portfolios were incorporated into three core courses for first-year students. The findings reveal that several conditions necessary to foster productive learning were missing in students’ experiences: strengthened formative role of e-portfolios through coherent assessment design; encouragement for students’ pursuit of authentic tasks to develop learning interests; engagement of students in reflective and self-regulative learning as an essential learning process; provision of constructive feedback for sustained learning support; and support for students’ autonomy through facilitation of collaborative knowledge building. By explicating how the lack of these conditions impeded students’ active involvement in e-portfolio tasks and suggesting relevant strategies for teachers at the institution in question, this paper offers implications for harnessing information and communication technology ( ICT) to support students’ productive learning.

Senjo \nThe world of women and work is aptly included in the social science literature but is the world of women and work, and sex? When women work in the sex industry as strippers, prostitutes or in online chat rooms, is that employment which is subject to labor law protection and provisions of occupational safety and health? Should it be? For the sex worker, according to this book, much depends on the possibility for authentic sexual feeling to be temporarily removed from the workplace of the sex worker, just as a manger might remove the desire for strict ethical adherence from work in a corporate bureaucracy. If the heart and soul of the sex worker is removed from the workplace, in that case, the sex worker is thought to be employed just like the rest of us. Presently, legal protection for sex workers is not quite socially or politically accepted, but neither has been much of any work by women which comes with complete autonomy, freedom, and financial benefit. Wherever sex work may be along the continuum of employment-related credibility, it is made more credible in the book On the Game: Women and Sex Work, a researchbased journey into the public and private worlds of female sex workers. On the Game takes a bold position that few other social scientists are willing to take: that sex work is metaphorically no different from any other wage-earning work. The author states, “I introduce views of prostitution as work, comparable to any other…” (p. 34). Twice in the book, the author provides a famous quote by Marx: ‘Prostitution is only a particular expression of the universal prostitution of the worker…’ (p. 41, p. 125; Marx 1975). On the Game attempts to deconstruct accumulated negative stereotypes of sex workers. It is a book not necessarily unwilling to view prostitution through a cultural lens. Rather, it is willing to do anything, so long as it views prostitution as “simply work”, much the same as work done by non-prostitutes."

Thornton \nAs LIBRARIANS ADDED AUDIOVISUAL MATERIALS to their collections and then electronic materials, they moved from selection as an individual activity to selection as a group activity. Librarians made every effort to mainstream the resulting selection process and incorporate it into the existing library organization. However, with the advent of the Internet and the ability to simultaneously share virtual resources, cooperative collection development, through consortial arrangements, became popular once again. The ability of consortia to purchase products at a better price than individual libraries can has made them very popular with funding agencies. However, the result is that the role of the selector has been diminished. As the purchase of virtual resources accelerates, particularly through consortial agreements, the autonomy of the local library will fade and the roles of librarians will change drastically. This rapid transformation is illustrated by a discussion of OhioLINK and its effects, both positive and negative, on one member library."

Therefore, a number of countries started to introduce ICT resources in all levels. Similarly, the Kuwaiti Ministry of Education (MoE) has recently mandated that all school staff meet certain standards to ensure that they have the ability to use ICT resources in their schools. However, the literature indicates that the integration of ICT in the classroom does not only rest in the hands of teachers; school principals also play a vital role in determining the success or failure of ICT use in the teaching process. This study sought to document the impact of Kuwaiti secondary school principals on their teachers’ attitude toward ICT embedding in classroom teaching. The multiple case studies approach was employed to access data from three secondary schools in Kuwait. Both open ended questionnaires and focus group interviews with 15 teachers were used to collect the data. The data analysis showed that all participating teachers recognized the impact that their principals’ leadership practices had on ICT embedding. They highlighted the effectiveness of the principals’ stimulation and encouragement of ICT embedding, which resulted in a change to the teaching practices, making them more ICT related. The study revealed that school principals in Kuwait had less autonomy, authority, and opportunity to adopt unique practices and behaviours in leading their schools. Therefore, the study recommends that the MoE revisit its regulations, specifically, those related to the school principals’ roles and responsibilities.

Osorio \nWe examine privacy-enhancing technologies based on the consistency of the business plans, technology, stated objectives, and the concept of privacy as embedded in the technologies. Three distinct trust models result from the three distinct concepts of privacy: a right of autonomy, a right to seclusion and a right to property. We use these trust models to segment the privacy market and classify the privacy-enhancing technologies. The Anonymizer and Zero Knowledge’s Freedom were built as technologies to enhance autonomy, while Privada Control, iPrivacy, and Incogno SafeZone are built to provide seclusion. Microsoft’s Passport is built with an assumption of privacy as a tradable property right. Security, privacy, and authentication are intertwined and sometimes confused in the privacy market. We argue that the creation of new trusted third party is not an effective strategy. In the case of creating a trusted third party, autonomy-based products have been more successful than seclusion-based products, despite the wider array of services offered by seclusion services."

Karageorghis \nMotives for Sport Participation as Predictors of Motivation Outcomes in Track and Field: A Self-Determination Theory Perspective Two types of motivation, intrinsic and extrinsic, have been of particular interest to researchers in the field of sport psychology (Deci & Ryan, 1985, 2000, 2008; Vallerand, 1997, 2001). Intrinsic motivation entails participation in an activity for the feelings of fun, pleasure, excitement, and satisfaction associated with it, while extrinsic motivation involves participation for the attainment of such rewards as money, trophies, and social approval or to avoid punishment. One of the most widely applied theoretical approaches to these types of motivation is self-determination theory, or SDT (Deci & Ryan, 1985, 2000; Ryan, 1995; Ryan & Deci, 2000). SDT also involves the concept of amotivation, or having no sense of purpose and lacking intent to engage in a particular behavior. SDT posits that the different types of motivation range on a continuum from high to low self-determination: intrinsic motivation–extrinsic motivation–amotivation (Deci & Ryan, 1985, 2000). Vallerand (1997, 2001) embraced elements of SDT and integrated them within a hierarchical theory of motivation. His model asserts that social factors, mediators (autonomy, competence, and relatedness), motivations, and consequences (affect, cognition, and behavior) exist at three levels, the global level, contextual level, and situational level. A number of studies have indicated that behavioral regulations spanning the SDT continuum would lead to a corresponding pattern of consequences (Ratelle, Vallerand, Chantal, & Provencher, 2004; Sarrazin, Vallerand, Guillet, Pelletier, & Cury, 2002; Standage, Duda, & Ntoumanis, 2003; Standage & Vallerand, 2008; Taylor, Ntoumanis, & Standage, 2008; Vlachopoulos, Karageorghis, & Terry, 2000; Wilson, Rodgers, Fraser, & Murray, 2004). That is, autonomous regulations and intrinsic motivation are expected to correspond with more positive outcomes, whereas less self-determined forms of regulation (external and introjected regulations) correspond with more negative outcomes, such as poor focus, burnout, and dropout. Vallerand’s proposals have found broad support in a range of sport and physical activity contexts (Standage et al., 2003; Wilson et al., 2004; Ntoumanis, 2001, 2005; Spray, Wang, Biddle, & Chatzisarantis, 2006); however, to date no study has examined these proposals in the context of a single sport. The purpose of the present study was to examine the extent to which motives for sport participation predicted motivation outcomes at the contextual level of motivation, thus affording a direct test of Vallerand’s (1997, 2001) model. On the basis of previous work (Ntoumanis, 2001; Vallerand & Bissonnette, 1992; Pelletier, Fortier, Vallerand, Tuson, Briere, & Blais, 1995; Ntoumani & Ntoumanis, 2006), it was hypothesized that identified regulation and the dimensions of intrinsic motivation would be significant positive predictors of motivation outcomes, while amotivation would be a significant negative predictor. Method Participants A sample of 159 volunteer track and field athletes was tested at eight athletics clubs in the London, United Kingdom, area (66 women and 93 men). Their mean age was 19.7 years (SD = 2.8). English was the first language of all participants. Full details of the ethnicity and level of participation of participants can be requested from the second author. Eighty-five athletes participated in sprint events (53.5%), 30 in middle distance events (18.9%), 33 in throwing events (20.7%), 4 in long-distance events (2.5%), and 7 in multievents (4.4%). Their years of experience in track and field ranged from 1 to 18 (M = 5.8 years, SD = 3.5). Measures Sport Motivation Scale. The 28-item Sport Motivation Scale (Pelletier et al. …"

One of the crucial challenges for OSN lies in information overload and network congestion. The demands for efficient knowledge discovery and data mining methods in OSN have been rising in recent year, particularly for online social applications, such as Flickr, YouTube, Facebook, and LinkedIn. In this paper, a Belief-Desire-Intention BDI agent-based method has been developed to enhance the capability of mining online social networks. Current data mining techniques encounter difficulties of dealing with knowledge interpretation based on complex data sources. The proposed agent-based mining method overcomes network analysis difficulties, while enhancing the knowledge discovery capability through its autonomy and collective intelligence."

Following a literature discussion about gender relations in low-income groups, as well as the role of mobile phones in love/sexual relationships, I argue that mobile phones are appropriated to strengthen love ties, but also cause tension and conflict to arise as they become tools of surveillance. In this sense, I discuss the ways in which mobile phones engender what Foucault called the micropolitics of daily life, in which men and women interact in sociocultural dynamics that may reproduce gender hierarchies, but also hold the potential to subvert them. As such, the analysis also pays attention to the vitality and humour present in women’s narratives, in order to argue that these seem to be connected to a certain autonomy of the female persona. The discussion engages with the work of various other researchers internationally and in Brazil and reflects on the cross-cultural implications of these practices in relation to similar studies in Africa."

Moreover, interplay between teaching and research demands creation and configuration of new learning environments to overcome a technology-focused approach and provide a more significant, enhanced teaching experience. Therefore it is reasonable for them to include collaborative and autonomous components as a learning strategy to simplify the acquisition of knowledge from a hands-on experience based on students’ interests. The methodology used in this work involved a literature review with a focus on analyzing the interpretation of several basic texts, the categorization and analysis of the teaching skills from a constructivist perspective within the ICT framework, allowing for a development of autonomous and collaborative education. Thus, the conclusions of this analysis point to a regular teachers’ training as one of the most important components of an action plan toward the successful implementation of teaching strategies that encourage an active involvement of students under teacher`s guide, whose main role is to stimulate the activation of the students’ metacognitive abilities and attitudes."

What is more, the study sets out to determine whether the gains in the two areas are maintained over time with respect to individual learners. The subjects were 45 Polish senior high school learners. The targeted structure was the final -ed sound of the simple past tense of regular English verbs. Three groups, two experimental and one control group, participated in the study. The intervention spanned the period of two weeks. The learners in Experimental Group 1 were provided with access to the Internet and were thus allowed to exercise more freedom in learning English pronunciation. The students in Experimental Group 2 were taught in a traditional way (i.e. controlled by the teacher) and the learners in the control group did not receive any instruction. The data were collected by means of a pronunciation autonomy questionnaire, as well as pronunciation tests administered before and after the study was concluded. The results reveal that the majority of individual students in Experimental Group 1 showed more autonomy and they outperformed their counterparts on the tests, which provides a justification for using digital technology as a tool for promoting autonomy and teaching pronunciation."

Traditional clinical scenarios can be viewed as closed-loop systems where caregivers are the controllers, medical devices act as sensors and actuators, and patients are the ‘‘plants.’’ MedCPSs alter this view by introducing additional computational entities that aid caregivers. Such systems are increasingly used in hospitals to provide high-quality continuous care for patients. The need to design complex MedCPSs that are both safe and effective presents numerous challenges, including achieving high assurance in medical system software, interoperability, context-aware intelligence, autonomy, security and privacy, and device certification.

With varying legal regimes, jurisdictional issues and standards of obscenity applied as well as varying degrees of care to be exercised, this area is a legal quagmire. This article addresses the question of whether we need an intermediary liability regime or not. The article posits that intermediary liability does not address the question of preventing transmission of child pornography as the actual culprits remain beyond the reach of law. A scheme of intermediary liability only acts as a disincentive to the intermediary to innovate and hinders growth of internet services. A comparison of three regimes, United States, European Union and India, is undertaken to see the legislative measures, developments in case law and analyze their stand towards the intermediary. The Article finally works towards arriving at alternative options so that the autonomy of the intermediary is not compromised through over-regulation and censorship."

The theory of self-determination describes the various effects of autonomous and controlled motivation in different areas - depending on its motivation, the same activity may have opposite effects on human well-being. Autonomous motivation is associated with psychological well-being positively, and controlled motivation negatively.The phenomenon of the opposite effect of two types of motivation of the same activity is confirmed in application to religion; also, these types of motivation are associated with the specific religious phenomena - literal or symbolic interpretation of the objects of faith and extremism. Several authors make recommendations on the ways to support the autonomy and psychological well-being of parishioners. The empirical part of the paper presents the results of the validation of the Russian version of the questionnaire of autonomous and controlled motivation in religion (Intrel). Items related to different motivational constructs (subtypes of autonomous and controlled motivation) having sufficient variance and consistency of responses were identified on an Internet sample of Orthodox Christians; selected items were factored. Constructed scales of autonomous and controlled motivation in religion showed good psychometric properties."

However, if such dimensions aspire to become renovator and not to injure the ultimate sense of the university, they could not undermine the aim of development of the person as person. In this article, we propose a theoretical reflection that considers several key aspects related to the conditions of fostering virtues on virtual higher education: the appropriate conception of autonomy of university students as members of an academic community, the relationships with peers and professors on virtual learning environments, the specificity of academic content, and the formal and relational criteria that support the aesthetic workmanship of higher education."

An additional requirement to contemporary educational processes is to prepare future professionals and the general public to a world where innovation is of great importance. Therefore, it is crucial the role that new technologies, especially digital technologies including the Internet, can play on the educational experiences of students and teachers throughout their school lives. The main feature of the independent learning approach is to explore the learner’s autonomy, and it is of key importance to adopt the student as the center of the learning process and, the stimulus to “learn to learn” as the main reference. Although the general definition includes self-learning stricto sensu, in fact, for most cases, within the regular school, in this methodology the protagonists are the integration with the curriculum and the teacher. Likewise, even though the potential use of this approach is, in general, associated with adults, it is at the young age that the habit of learn to learn better develops, more naturally and relevant. We will also present essential issues associated to the third great educational revolution, symbolized by the digital technologies and the innovation’s central role in the contemporary world, which are deeply affecting two key items of the teaching-learning process: the way we produce new knowledge, and the way we construct it pedagogically. So, we quickly evolve to a scenario where the complex digital competence and the vocation for innovation will match, in level of importance, the traditional knowledge and to the typical skills taught in today’s schools, demanding “independent learning” as the appropriate methodology for elementary and intermediate schools."

    "text": "Doc 62 :  In Reply to “‘I Started to Feel Like a “Real Doctor”’: Medical Students’ Reflections on Their Psychiatry Clerkship”. \nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s40596-015-0418-6\n Jason Rosenstock \nTo the Editor: I read with interest the excellent report by Schatte et al. [1] on the reflective writing of medical students during the psychiatry clerkship experience. I strongly agree that narrative reflection can greatly help students process complex and challenging experiences during training, and I think it is particularly useful for us educators to understand and respond to the most important themes that emerge from such reflection. At our institution, we have required students to write a 500word reflective essay at some point during their clerkship, with the general prompt of picking a patient they worked with that stood out for them, writing about what made them stand out. This essay counts for 10 % of their final grade, with student papers assessed for empathy, ability to reflect on meaning, and presentation of broader issues beyond the case. An informal look at the past year of essays shows very similar themes to the ones reported by Schatte et al. Out of 159 essays, 18 % emphasized themes of context (that patients do not exist in a vacuum, that family and social forces matter, etc.). Another 17 % addressed the struggle of patients with mental illness, particularly recognizing the severity of illness and functional effects. The third most common theme (16 %) related to challenges in the doctor-patient relationship, particularly countertransference, provider limitations, and resistance. To our surprise, only 5 % of essays addressed issues of patient autonomy or paternalism (e.g., coercion, capacity, etc.). We were particularly interested in examining if there were any differences in themes between essays written at the very start of the students’ clerkship year, compared to the writing of students at the very end. Although the combined sample is small (n=38), it does appear that students just starting clerkships were more likely than their veteran peers to write about issues of context and the doctor-patient relationship (50 vs. 25 % for both) and less likely to address issues of autonomy, severity, or patient-centered care. When we sit down with students to discuss the clerkship experience, these are the issues we now highlight, both at the outset and during the clerkship, in an effort to help students more productively and safely grow into their professional identity and role. Using reflective writing as a prompt for group discussion can further deepen the value of such writing [2]. Finally, it also seems important that such a process takes place throughout the medical curriculum, not just on psychiatry. Although the psychiatry clerkship certainly raises unique and powerful issues related to patient care, the most common themes raised by students certainly occur in many clinical contexts, and students are likely to benefit from reflection on all clerkships. At our institution, we have successfully encouraged other clerkships to add a writing component to the requirements, and other medical schools do reflective writing throughout the curriculum, which seems to be a particularly useful way to help students with their professional development."

This study stresses that: (1) by institutional arrangement, China’s media are “mouthpieces” of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and their “Yu Lun Jian Du” practice has always been under strict party control; (2) as a media discourse, “Yu Lun Jian Du” helps journalists pursue professional autonomy under the premise of conformity to party rules; (3) the emergence of the Internet affords unprecedented possibilities for free expression, however, it has as yet not subverted China’s established media system. Provided that China’s political system remains intact, the media will remain an organ of the CCP and the practice of “Yu Lun Jian Du” will remain one component of the CCP’s exercise of political power."

Considering that there are texts from diverse fields of knowledge circulating on the internet, undergraduate students find it easier to copy than to construct their own authorship. In order to contribute to this discussion, this study intends to reflect on the need to open objective and subjective spaces in the University - the place for the production of language - in order to make construction of authorship effective in the dialectic between the individual and the collective. In this sense, reading and writing practices should be experienced as the motivation for intellectual production, with the intention of providing the student, as a future teacher, with the autonomy needed to write and to establish him or herself as author, as he or she navigates the digital network."

This article presents a study of the development of My medical record on the Internet, a civic service originally inspired by the home banking concept. The study illustrates how the technology is developed and inscribed with new technical norms, dictating access and use. These norms are in turn shaped by negotiations between social and legal norms as well as the values and beliefs of several different actors involved in the development process. Supported by the study, we conclude: 1) that the new technology challenges the medical professionals, thus causing resistance as the institutional boundaries are changed when patients are given digital access to their medical record; 2) that the technology changes or inscribes the law; 3) that a pilot project of this type is dependent on an enthusiast, seeing the project through until it becomes accepted on a larger scale; and 4) that increased patient participation requires improved access to information which differs from the NPM rhetoric advocating more service to customers."

This dichotomy fails to capture the complex nature of the cybersex phenomenon, and accordingly, the varied lived experiences of individuals in the context of an emergent “Information Society.” We wish to broaden the discursive space by adopting the affective labor perspective and showcasing cybersex narratives that traverse themes of exploitation, negotiation, resistance, and agency in ICT use. Using two case studies, we illustrate how cybersex is experienced, organized, mediated, and made meaningful. We also describe how laborers are inscribed in mechanisms of surveillance and control, as they develop counter-measures to compromise, challenge or take advantage of these mechanisms. Our analysis reveals that cybersex laborers create value, not just in monetizing their labor, but also in pursuing autonomy, personal development, and kinship-oriented care. The lived experiences of cybersex laborers also produce new and potent forms of bio-politics. These multi-faceted narratives problematize the State-sponsored ICT discourse. On one hand, laborers embody the impositions made upon service-based labor by the global digital economy: rudimentary technological skills, the ability to speak English, the ability to empathize and foster customer relations. On the other, their exclusion engendered the refusal to be subjected to the standards and prerequisites of the legitimate, “formal” digital economy. Cybersex’s anomalous position, we contend, is a reflexive by-product of the neoliberal digital economy that puts premium less on ICT for development and more on labor that serves, foremost, ICT for capital."

In this context, a way to avoid a participant to voluntarily leave the system is satisfying its interests when allocating queries. However, participants satisfaction may also be negatively affected by the failures of other participants. Query replication is a solution to deal with providers failures, but, it is challenging because of autonomy: it cannot only quickly overload the system, but also it can dissatisfy participants with uninteresting queries. Thus, a natural question arises: should queries be replicated? If so, which ones? and how many times? In this paper, we answer these questions by revisiting query replication from a satisfaction and probabilistic point of view. We propose a new algorithm, called S b QR, that decides on-the-fly whether a query should be replicated and at which rate. As replicating a large number of queries might overload the system, we propose a variant of our algorithm, called S b QR+. The idea is to voluntarily fail to allocate as many replicas as required by consumers for low critical queries so as to keep resources for high critical queries during query-intensive periods. Our experimental results demonstrate that our algorithms significantly outperform the baseline algorithms from both the performance and satisfaction points of view. We also show that our algorithms automatically adapt to the criticality of queries and different rates of participant failures."

Improving health care locally, regionally and globally by using information and communication technology is an important goal of eHealth and its applications. The aim of this review is to describe different ethical aspects of eHealth applications. This article is a systematic review. Relevant literature was searched from databases and 18 chosen articles were analyzed by using a data based qualitative content analysis. Six ethical aspects concerning eHealth and its applications were found from the reviewed literature: autonomy, privacy, confidentiality, consent, equality of service availability and beneficence. eHealth applications have a potential to improve health care services comprehensively, especially in remote areas. There are still ethical concerns that need to be addressed as the technology continues to develop. eHealth can be an effective addition to traditional health care services as long as the health and wellbeing of patients remain as the central point and eHealth applications are not used only to gain financial savings."

Address: 53, Kabanbay batyra av., 010000, Astana, the Republic of Kazakhstan. Email: aizhan.omarbekova@nu.edu.kzAutonomy of educational institutions has been consistently extended in Kazakhstan over the last years: national educational standards have been broken into invariable and variable components, boards of regents have been introduced, per capita financing system is being tested, and autonomous educational organizations have been established, such as Nazarbayev University in higher education and Nazarbayev intellectual schools in secondary education. The paper analyzes legislative instruments, standards and official documents regulating the process of education in the secondary education system to define the extent to which educational institutions enjoy autonomy. Besides, the article uses the data of interviews and focus groups with 46 administrators and 95 teachers of schools, gymnasia and lyceums in different regions of Kazakhstan to analyze how they understand the notion of ‘autonomy of educational institutions’ and how they assess the current degree of autonomy of organizations they work in. The conclusion is that granting more autonomy and independence comes from above but is not requested by schools. Autonomy becomes a challenge for contemporary schools, as more independence implies greater responsibility.DOI: 10.17323/1814-9545-2015-2-152-172"

Yet the question of how a firm’s internal structure affects its governance choice for new activities has received scant empirical attention. We examine the role of internal structure, specifically unit autonomy and lateral coordination, in a firm’s governance decision for new, knowledge-intensive activities. The findings show that internal structure is a ‘shift parameter’ that affects governance choice by moderating the relationship between task complexity and degree of integration.

This article sketches the contours of an emerging culture of interveillance where non-hierarchical and non-systematic monitoring practices are part of everyday life. It also introduces a critical perspective on how the industrial logics of dominant social media, through which interveillance practices are normalized, resonate with social forces already at play in individualized societies. The argument is developed in three steps. Firstly, it is argued that the concept of interveillance is needed, and must be distinguished from surveillance, in order to critically assess the everyday mutual sharing and disclosure of private information (of many different kinds). Secondly, it is argued that the culture of interveillance responds to the social deficit of recognition that characterizes highly individualized societies. Finally, it is argued that the culture of interveillance constitutes a defining instance and even represents a new stage of the meta-process of mediatization. The dialectical nature of interveillance integrates and reinforces the overarching ambiguities of mediatization, whereby the opportunities for individuals and groups to achieve growing freedom and autonomy are paralleled by limitations and dependences vis-a-vis media."

The study invoked the Vygotskian sociocultural theoretical framework and employed discourse analysis as a research tool to describe and explain outstanding features of chat room communication. Specific interactional features examined are intersubjectivity, off-task discussion, greetings and leave-takings, identity exploration and role play, humor and sarcasm, and use of the L1 (English). Through these communicative behaviors, learners appropriated the chat room environment, transforming it into a learner-centered discourse community governed by communicative autonomy and the use of language and discourse functions that go beyond those encountered in the typical L2 classroom."

In some cases of cyberphysical networks, their configuration can be done in a centralized way (e.g., automated production line configuration). However, for socio-cyberphysical networks the centralized control is not possible due to the independence and autonomy of the network members (e.g., employees of an enterprise). The paper proposes an approach to model such network via a set of interacting socio-inspired services. Such services are capable to model behavior of the network participants taking into account their preferences, strategies and social norms. The interoperability of the services is achieved due to the usage of common standards (such as WSDL and SOAP) at the technological level, and common ontology at the semantic level. The developed conceptual model of socio-inspired service is presented together with behavior patterns and methods for their processing."

A democratic system of government, which wins popular legitimacy, is expected to lay down solid and systematic foundations with serious political will and practical commitment for the realization of “market place of ideas”. Besides, free and democratic societies, which have constitutionally stipulated rights to freely access, transfer, and choose information with diversity of sources and contents, could naturally have the better chance to pass informed decisions and judgments in cogently defining their destinies. In principle, such a democratic political system, with all its contemporary challenges, does not therefore impose up on individual citizens’ mind public media over private media, domestic media over international as well as social media, and development oriented news over diversity of ideas. Though there are varieties of literatures as well as research works conducted in this regard, little has done in critically justifying why such a system authorizes individual human agents to be indispensible and autonomous vetoes to determine the sources and the contents of information. Besides, this work tries to critically explore some of the positive developments and existential challenges posing significant threat to such a democratic value for the autonomy of individual human actors. To this effect, critical evaluation and reflection of the main philosophical assumptions on freedom of information, which in turn enable us to critically assess contemporary problems and opportunities, have been parts of this article. In this regard, however, this work has not been an attempt for generalization on topic raised based on existential situations of individual countries."

Whereas for a long time social interpretation homed in on the doomsday scenarios of demographic change, it is the economic potential that is now emerging with increasing clarity. Information and communication technologies stand a good chance of benefiting from this trend. Older people are not intrinsically technology refuseniks, as evidenced by the growing number of silver agers using the internet. Successful products will be far removed from disenfranchisement and stigmatisation. The challenge to product developers and marketing strategists is to create age-appropriate offers that older people do not perceive as encroaching on their autonomy or pointing up their physical infirmities. Particularly promising are offers enabling barrier-free use without seeming like segregational solutions for specific age groups. User friendliness, value systems and the legal framework are currently stymieing yet wider success. Technical fascination aside, the business potential hinges directly on regulations concerning data protection, teletreatment and cost reimbursement, on user friendliness and society’s attitude towards the application of robotics in medicine and healthcare. The tasks involved are enormous. Product developers, marketing strategists, physicians, nurses and carers, politicians and older people in need of help themselves must be prepared to take the new routes. Assistance systems, e-Health and health games benefit from demographic change. The range of offers is highly diversified. They extend from ‘intelligent’ tablet dispensers, emergency bio sensor technology in motor vehicles and motion sensor technology through tele-monitoring and online consultations to brain jogging and exercise games."

Although physical exercise interventions may delay functional decline, there are difficulties in implementing them and performing seamless follow-up at home. Very few technological solutions attempt to address this challenge and improve individual participation.Our objectives are to (1) develop a technological solution designed to support active aging of frail older persons, (2) conduct a first laboratory evaluation of the device, and (3) design a multidimensional clinical trial to validate our solution.We conducted a first phase of multidisciplinary meetings to identify real end users and health professional’s unmet needs, and to produce specifications for the architecture of the solution. In a second phase, we performed laboratory tests of the first proposed prototype (a smart insole) with 3 healthy volunteers. We then designed an ongoing clinical trial to finalize the multidimensional evaluation and improvement of the solution.To respond to the needs expressed by the stakeholders (frailty monitoring and adherence improvement), we developed a prototype of smart shoe insole to monitor key parameters of frailty during daily life and promote walking. It is a noninvasive wireless insole, which automatically measures gait parameters and transmits information to a remote terminal via a secure Internet connection. To ensure the solution’s autonomy and transparency, we developed an original energy harvesting system, which transforms mechanical energy produced by the user’s walking movement into electrical energy. The first laboratory tests of this technological solution showed good reliability measures and also a good acceptability for the users. We have planned an original iterative medical research protocol to validate our solution in real life.Our smart insole could support preventive strategies against disability in primary care by empowering the older patients without increasing the busy health professional’s workload.Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02316600; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=NCT02316600&Search=Search.

Newer forms of professional learning stand in contrast to more traditional forms of professional development. The shifting paradigm has implications for school leaders in all contexts. This study sought to qualitatively examine how a sample of eight school leaders worked to support professional learning in their school communities and leverage tools in areas such as content aggregation, media creation, blogging and social media. In one-on-one and focus group interviews, participants discussed how technology is changing professional learning in their context and reflected on how their leadership has evolved in response to perceived challenges. Findings suggest that school leaders are aware of the importance of supporting professional learning through multiple device platforms, online networks and opportunities to play, and experiment with technology. Current issues identified include the need to shift fro…"

Than the author presents the examples of the different kinds of meetings of Church hierarchs on the highest level and its titles/names. Than the article gives a short presentation of the initiative and history of the convene of Pan-Orthodox Council. The idea of that kind of meeting was born in the beginning of XX century on Ecumenical Patriarchate. The preparation to the Pan-Orthodox Council lasts many yearsand contains of many different kind of meetings. Meetings of the special commission that consists of representatives of each Autocephaly Orthodox Church concentrate on the different topics. During last meetings several important topics were discussed, as: Orthodox Diaspora, Autonomy and the methods of its granting, Autocephaly and the methods of its grantingand Diptychs. The author, who took part in some of these meeting,explains the positions of the various Churches in these matters as well asshares his opinions on them. In conclusion the author presents the opinion that despite many different problems on the way to prepare the Pan-Orthodox Council, this idea can be realized even in the near future."

Clark \n Deborah Everhart \nThere is currently an increased interest in the effect of Internet use in the college student population, a group that may be particularly susceptible to problems related to online use because of the accessibility afforded them on campuses and due to their developmental stage of identity formation. The current study examined the relationship between quan- tity of Internet use and the common concerns of college students. An online student survey of behavior and concerns was administered to 182 college freshmen. The survey included demographic variables, ratings of satisfaction with various campus experiences, and ratings of level of concerns for 78 problems or issues that are often faced by college students. Freshman students who use the Internet for less than 10 hours per week were at least twice as likely as those who do not to report concern over feeling sad or depressed, not knowing how to study effectively, feeling lonely, jug- gling too many roles, and not living up to people’s expectations. Results showed that male students who were online more than 10 hours per week expressed significantly less concern about their emerging role definitions and autonomy. Female students who used the Internet for more than 10 hours per week reported significantly less concern about being sad or depressed. These results support the hypothesis that Internet use in college freshmen may represent a successful coping mechanism. This finding is discussed in relation to recent research reports on both detriments and benefits of online use by college students."

The digital divide is present across the globe as the result of a complex of factors such as the inequality in: access to hardware and connectivity; autonomy of use; digital and literacy skills; availability of technical and social support; and access to educators skilled in the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs). Although there is rapid progress in the growth of mobile subscriptions across the globe, there remain groups of digitally excluded peoples within and across countries. Moreover, although progress has been made in addressing connectivity issues and challenges in learning about digital technology, teachers and learners continue to face issues and challenges related to teaching-and-learning with digital technologies and resources within local contexts and beyond. For instance, in an era of rapid global cultural, political, economic and social changes, the need for intercultural education has never been greater. Not only does digital exclusion contribute to a knowledge divide but it also limits opportunities for intercultural connections, communications and understandings. Building on the work of previous EDUsummITs, the EDUsumIT 2013 participants focused on exploring how digital equity and intercultural education are intertwined. This paper describes current needs and challenges as well as opportunities related to digital equity and intercultural education, as well as the increasingly important role technology plays in helping to foster intercultural understanding and education. These are illustrated by examples of how access to digital resources may help bridge both the digital and cultural divides and relate them to some of the recommendations for policy and practice made by the EduSummit 2013 Digital Equity and Intercultural Education Workgroup to help address these needs."

From a definition of LSP centered on learner need, specificity of activities and materials, and teacher and learner profiles, this article examines how technology has transformed LSP teaching and learning. Through technology, LSP teachers and researchers can access discipline-specific materials and situations and compile corpora of specialized texts. Computer-mediated communication provides learning tools and a gateway to the discourse community. Technology also provides opportunities for collaborating, creating virtual environments and online courses, and fostering learner autonomy. These applications are examined within the current LSP scenario, paying attention to conditions and challenges for implementation, as well as to the roles of teachers and learners. This article also points to areas that merit further analysis from an LSP perspective, such as the use of different technologies and modes for effective learning, the analysis of specialized texts, and the integration into LSP of emerging technologies that have made their way into social uses.

We interviewed volunteers and organisers to gain insight into the efficacy of the volunteer coordination effort. Volunteers praised the system of communication and the involvement of indigenous groups. They expressed a desire for better training, more flexibility and community autonomy, a quicker uptake of volunteer support, and the use of social media. Locating the Incident Command Centre in a single site aided interaction between experts, and the sharing of resources. Overall, the volunteer coordination was considered a success."

In recent years, Taiwanese reporters have experienced an increase in workload and an intensification of managerial control due to the introduction of new technologies in the newsroom. Using ICTs in the workplace consequently has harmed journalists’ working conditions and autonomy. Moreover, ICTs have led to a trivialization of reporting tasks and devaluation of reporters’ experience and knowledge. The degradation of reporting work resulting from the use of ICTs has enabled managers at Taiwanese newspapers to hire young employees to fill the jobs of experienced reporters and to reduce salary costs."

The study is descriptive-correlational, using an non-probability sampling of the population considered. Instruments mentioned were psychometrically analyzed to fit our reality. As a result it was found that supportive behaviors are linked to the acceptance of itself, use skills and clarity of personal goals; on the contrary, the favorable attitude toward aggressive behavior is associated with low self-acceptance and the mismanagement of the opportunities offered by the environment. Finally, differences were found in age, gender and professional areas."

This is in order to make an approach to understand the current state and provide a conceptual input that advices decision making, policies and programs regarding ICTs towards its trends in universities. ICTs mean modernization, quality, productivity, better services and support to educational processes. Therefore, some universities try to be up-to-date because they consider that ICTs gives them the advantage, which is why it is imperative to investigate how this process was faced. This synthesis followed the methodology of the History of Education3 . ICTs were integrated in the Colombian universities mainly in the concepts of teaching and management through university’s autonomy, advancing in every context towards an on-line university. Nowadays, the potential and services have become real, there are public policies available and on-line modality is increasing, however the University 2.0 trend must be reached."

Along with the interaction between users and computers, social media is rapidly becoming an important part of our digital experience, ranging from digital textual information to diverse multimedia forms. These aspects and characteristics constitute of the core of second generation of web. Social networking (SN) and recommender system (RS) are two hot and popular topics in the current Web 2.0 era, where the former emphasises the generation, dissemination and evolution of user relations, and the latter focuses on the use of collective preferences of users so as to provide the better experience and loyalty of users in various web applications. Leveraging user social connections is able to alleviate the common problems of sparsity and cold-start encountered in RS. This paper aims to summarise the research progresses and findings in these two areas and showcase the empowerment of integrating these two kinds of research strengths."

As both longitudinal, populational studies and virtual personal genomics strain the confines of deontological and legal parameters of consent to health privacy, it becomes important to ask: What are the convergent and divergent elements of health privacy in these new contexts? And, is there a need to reconstruct privacy? Historically, the legal and ethical framework surrounding the protection of privacy has been centered on the right of the individual to control and limit the flow of personal information. Indeed, the protection of privacy is traditionally viewed as stemming from a unilateral emphasis on autonomy as underscored by article 12 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights: No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or corre-"

In order to prevent what former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta characterized as a “Cyber Pearl Harbor,” the US government has to engage the private sector in order to build a solid public-private partnership (PPP) for cybersecurity. For there to be a successful cybersecurity PPP between the US government and the private sector, there must be a PPP founded on a model composed of four essential elements: a high level of trust between the public and private entities that corresponds to a mutual belief in the positive gains of both partners; clear baseline guidance imposed from legislation, which should be reinforced with government training and financial incentives; a bottom-up structural approach for efficient operations that allows for more autonomy at lower levels on local needs and resources; and, gaining influential community involvement in the formation of PPPs from all levels of the participating organizations, as well as civil leadership and the general public.

It also means inventing new modes of living, producing and, not in the least place, struggling collectively , as workers and producers. As the so-called digital revolution unfolds in the context of a neoliberal cognitive and consumerist capitalism, its ‘innovations’ are predominantly employed to modulate and control both production processes and consumer behavior in view of the overall goal of extracting surplus value. Today, the digital networks overwhelmingly destroy social autonomy, instead engendering increasing social heteronomy and proletarianization. Yet it is these very networks themselves, as technical pharmaka in the sense of French ‘technophilosopher’ Bernard Stiegler, that can be employed as no other to struggle against this tendency. This paper briefly explores this possibility by reflecting upon current diagnoses of our ‘technological situation’ by some exemplary post-operaist Marxists from a Stieglerian, pharmacological perspective."

Crockett \n Jeffrey E. McGee \n G. Tyge Payne \nEstablished firms often create new business divisions in response to new ways of competing, such as those based on disruptive innovations. Using a sample of daily newspapers and their Internet divisions, this study examines the corporate characteristics of orientation, attention, and control and venture management team characteristics of vision, experience, and collective efficacy and their interactive effects on the overall performance of the new division. Findings demonstrate that vision and collective efficacy are related to venture outcomes, orientation affects the experience and vision to venture performance relationships, attention enhances the vision and collective efficacy to performance relationships, and decision autonomy influences the experience and collective efficacy to venture performance relationships. Overall, the results of this study imply that specific venture management team characteristics and corporate characteristics may be tailored to improve chances of meeting specific performance targets and achieving overall venture success."

In South Korea, traditional Confucianism and recent technological advancements serve as influential social and cultural contexts that affect parent–child relations and child development. High levels of parental control and strong emphasis on academic achievement have long been distinctive features of Korean parenting practices, which are attributable to Confucian values. Additionally, Korean children’s mobile phone dependency (MPD) has become a growing concern, as South Korea developed as an IT powerhouse. Combined, these contexts resulted in high parental control of children’s mobile phone use, so that such electronic devices would not hinder learning and achievement. Effects of high parental control on children’s MPD and their school life, however, have yet to be discovered. We hypothesized, that, unlike parents’ intentions, psychological control is more likely to increase MPD and disrupt school life. To examine this research model, we made use of the first and third wave data from Korea Children and Youth Panel Survey. Participants were 2378 children (52.2 % boys) of the same age of 10 in the first wave. After multiple imputation for missing values, hierarchical logistic regression followed to examine the mediational model. The results verified the hypothesized model, showing significant adverse influence of psychological control on MPD, self-regulated learning and school adjustment. MPD fully mediated the effect of psychological control on self-regulations, while partially mediating the effects on school adjustment. Implications for Korean parents with regard to supporting children’s psychological autonomy was discussed."

However, most existing scholarship has only focused on CPCs within the United States; hardly any literature has been devoted to anti-CPC activism. This study contributes to addressing these gaps by adopting a mixed method. The paper first reviews the status quo of U.S. and Canadian CPCs through the existing literature to contextualize my investigation. Then it explores the establishment of individual Canadian CPCs to evaluate whether they are gaining more influence. It also analyzes the presence and absence of information on Canadian anti-CPC activism in the social media of RJ organizations. Finally, it examines the interviews I conducted with Canadian RJ activists to identify the ongoing anti-CPC activism and why some groups do not regard it central to their agenda. Results of this research reveal that CPCs have been continuously expanding in Canada during the past 35 years. Despite realizing their threat, most Canadian RJ groups do not focus their activism on CPCs and instead, concern themselves more with such issues as abortion access owing to their political engagement restriction, as well as their viewpoint that variation among Canadian CPCs and the Canadian liberal political context lessen CPCs&rsquo; overall threat. The limited ongoing activism includes lobbying for halting funding for CPCs, revoking their charitable statuses, banning their advertisements, and removing their biased sex education from public schools."

Deshmukh \nAbstract The internet has had a tremendous impact on our routine life. Recent developments in the Internet of Things (IoT) technology have brought several issues to fore. IoT is a new emerging technology in which the electronic devices communicate through the medium of the Internet for remote sensing and control. IoT is not a single technology; rather it is the convergence of heterogeneous technologies pertaining to different engineering domains. Prominent technologies include Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID), Networking and Communication, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Real-Time Systems (RTS), Cloud computing, etc. In establishing communication between devices, IoT exposes to many challenges on account of the diversity of devices, energy, and power constraints, noise, and interference, stringent requirement of timeliness, etc. Though several researchers have attempted addressing these challenges in IoT, more research is still required for the complete transition from internet protocol version 4 (IPv4), developed in 1981 to IPv6, developed in 2008. Researchers need to focus on increasing the address space to cater to unlimited things on our planet, evolving set of standards for uniformity and developing new energy sources for powering every single sensor. Till date, research has focused on evolving design strategies for energy autonomy in electronic devices deployed in IoT, so as to enable self-powering of a device, in absence of DC supply. Present work reviews research on implementable methods of energy autonomy, reported in the recent literature (during 2010 to 2018), so as to identify immediate issues to be addressed and new directions to be explored for enhancing energy autonomy of devices deployed in IoT. The conclusions of the work will be useful for researchers engaged with addressing issues in energy optimization in various domains of IoT. Also, the conclusions will be of interest to business personnel, sponsoring government agencies, agencies for standardization of performance and academicians engaged in the development of IoT."

Beyond Functional Use \nhttps://doi.org/10.7821/naer.2019.1.327\n Julio Cabero-Almenara \n Maria Luisa Arancibia \n Annachiara Del Prete \nHigher education institutions at the international level have seen the need to adopt and integrate information and communication technologies to meet the opportunities and challenges of innovation in teaching and learning processes. This logic has led to the implementation of virtual learning environments called ‘Learning Management Systems’, the functionalities of which support flexible and active learning under a constructivist approach. This study measured didactic and technological use of Moodle and its implications in teaching from a quantitative approach by administering a questionnaire to a sample of 640 higher education teachers. Some guiding questions were as follows: Are teachers using the Moodle platform for didactic purposes? What strategies, resources and tools are teachers using, and what do they contribute to student-centred teaching? Are teaching strategies that are focused on collaboration, interaction and student autonomy promoted? The results coincide with those of other studies, confirming an instrumental and functional use of the platform, which is mainly being used as a repository for materials and information, while its pedagogical use remains limited. This is becoming a problem in higher education institutions, something that requires debate and reflection from a systemic perspective on the adoption and integration of technology in the classroom."

A factor analysis of eight indices retrieved from the 362 data items was conducted. A total of 24 Chinese researchers were interviewed and given a robust test.,The results indicate that Chinese general social media (GSM) is insufficient to support academic research and it is difficult for scholars to enhance the visibility of their academic performance using GSM platforms, which can actually induce addiction. University resources, management systems, and working environment affect how scholars apply SM.,The authors examined the researchers’ SM behavior by giving them a questionnaire and interview; however, this approach proved inadequate. The academic performance of researchers is affected by numerous factors, but the authors only considered SM behavior.,It is suggested that universities apply academic social media (ASM) indicators to measure researchers’ contributions so that they self-regulate their SM usage attitudes. Also, universities should also promote ASM platforms.,This study analyzed scholars’ GSM usage and academic performance, and the moderating effect of university level on the relationship between need for competence and relatedness and need for autonomy. This comprehensive analysis contributes to the scholarly SM usage literature."

Policies concerning information technologies, from telegraph to satellite networks, have also been central to media politics and with the rise of new media, internet related policies have similarly become pivotal to the interaction between the state and media system. Drawing from a comparative media system perspective, this paper argues that while there has been no major constitutional or legal overhaul, as yet, new ideas and information technology policy activism are reshaping the contours of state action and ‘autonomy’ of the press in India’s democracy. Comparing technology debates in an earlier era, when satellite networks swept across the media system, with the more recent deliberations around liabilities for digital intermediaries, the paper unpacks the nature of change and locates its origins in the revival of discursive institutions (Schmidt 2002, 2008) of technology policy since the early 2000s. Technology related ideas, I argue, now serve as institutions, able to function as a ‘coordinating discourse’ (ibid) that have revived ideals of an autonomous media. Technology inflected ideals of ‘anonymity’ also counter the ‘communicative discourse’ (ibid) of Hindutva and cultural nationalist politics of media which framed the issue of autonomy in the ascendant phase of print and electronic media capitalism until the 1990s."

The look of the fashionable ideal is, of course, ever subject to change. However, there are qualities that are always present: the body is subject to the authority of fashion, limitations to the autonomy of the body such as gravity or ageing are absent, and the figure is imbued with possibility and mutability, even as it freezes a momentary state of perfection.\nThese qualities become particularly marked in the present era, in which digital influencers simultaneously assume the roles of cultural producer, model and consumer while implicitly embodying the fashionable ideal. At the moment of their publication, the labor of producing these images seems to evaporate, as bodies with no material limitation are presented with immediacy, and figure, commodity and surrounds collapse into one.\nThis article interrogates how we can conceive of the labor of appearance and being in the fashion image, and considers how this style of fashion imagery draws on visual rhetoric of prior eras of fashion photography and is structured by the existing power relations of capitalism and the human and non-human actors of media technologies. In so doing, the concept of the fashionable ideal is explored in one of its contemporary iterations as fluid, aspirational, global, simultaneously embodied and disembodied."

Bowker \nArtificial Intelligence (AI) in the form of different machine learning models is applied to Big Data as a way to turn data into valuable knowledge. The rhetoric is that ensuing predictions work well—with a high degree of autonomy and automation. We argue that we need to analyze the process of applying machine learning in depth and highlight at what point human knowledge production takes place in seemingly autonomous work. This article reintroduces classification theory as an important framework for understanding such seemingly invisible knowledge production in the machine learning development and design processes. We suggest a framework for studying such classification closely tied to different steps in the work process and exemplify the framework on two experiments with machine learning applied to Facebook data from one of our labs. By doing so we demonstrate ways in which classification and potential discrimination take place in even seemingly unsupervised and autonomous models. Moving away from concepts of non-supervision and autonomy enable us to understand the underlying classificatory dispositifs in the work process and that this form of analysis constitutes a first step towards governance of artificial intelligence."

Bradley \n Brittany A. Duncan \nAbstract Most cyber-physical human systems (CPHS) rely on users learning how to interact with the system. Rather, a collaborative CPHS should learn from the user and adapt to them in a way that improves holistic system performance. Accomplishing this requires collaboration between the human-robot/human-computer interaction and the cyber-physical system communities in order to feed back knowledge about users into the design of the CPHS. The requisite user studies, however, are difficult, time consuming, and must be carefully designed. Furthermore, as humans are complex in their interactions with autonomy it is difficult to know, a priori, how many users must participate to attain conclusive results. In this paper we elaborate on our work to infer intrinsic user qualities through human-robot interactions correlated with robot performance in order to adapt the autonomy and improve holistic CPHS performance. We first demonstrate through a study that this idea is feasible. Next, we demonstrate that significant differences between groups of users can impact conclusions particularly where different autonomies are involved. Finally, we also provide our rich, extensive corpus of user study data to the wider community to aid researchers in designing better CPHS."

It seems that it has not been expected, that at least one of these regions will demonstrate such strong sense of identity that it will not only demand broader autonomy, but also full independence. Can social media and Google tools help in achieving this goal? Will it be possible to use them to build support for Catalan activities among the international community? And finally – will data obtained thanks to Google enable to forecast future political events? The Author is looking for answers to these questions by analyzing data obtained during research conducted in the network, as well as information gathered while conducting interviews with Catalan politicians in the moment of region’s fight for independence."

However, although various assisted living systems have been proposed in the last decade, the goal of realizing an effective domestic support system for elderly is still far from reached. In this work, we present a project aiming to re-engineer a set of everyday life objects, equipping them with environmental and wearable sensors, thus to monitor the condition of older people in their domestic residences and provide security while preserving the autonomy and independence of the subjects. The main focus of the paper at hand is on the requirements and solutions implemented to realize the backbone infrastructure of such system as regards both the adopted semantic message routing mechanism and the newly conceived approach to event analysis, which combines Complex Event Processing and a reactive implementation of Event Calculus."

In the research, only a relationship was found with the presence of siblings and family typology, for Internet addiction. There was a broad search for references that, in general, confirm the relationship between family variables and addictive variables for Young students of secondary schools, but not for university students. As a result of this review, we hypothesize that, for young university students, family variables lose their importance in favor of other variables such as networks of friends, features of the young person at this stage of his or her development characterized by the search for autonomy and differentiation, and even residential independence from the family. Finally, this background course allows us to state that addictive behavior is determined by individual and contextual factors that require a complex systemic approach and a perspective focused on coping strategies and resilient capacity, as personal variables."

The pilot project took place at UIN Malulana Malik Ibrahim Malang; it was conducted benefitted from the familiarity of the young people toward social media. The aims of this task were to promote the students’ autonomy learning by giving them the opportunities to practice their speaking skill, building up their self-confidence, and challenging their creativity. Therefore, the questionnaire, as the self-reflection feedback, consisted of three questions; whether the making of news program gives them the opportunities to practice their speaking skill, builds up their confidence, and challenges their creativity. There were 30 students involved in this pilot project. The result of data analysis showed that most of the participants strongly agreed the making a new program give them a chance to practice their speaking skill, build up their self-confidence, and challenge their creativity. Therefore, making a news program can be an out-of-speaking class activity in order to promote the students’ autonomy learning."

However, the transhumanists hide two subjects: the use of technological implants as a weapon against the citizen and the method they are developing their dangerous projects with, which is suspected to be illicit human experiments in the world. Technological implants like brain nanobots might cause losing mind control and thus, the carriers can be controlled by others and lose their autonomy, they can be spied permanently with the cerebral internet and can lose their privacy their memory can be deleted and can loose their identity. Thus, the humans who carry technological implants can be permanently spied on, mentally controlled and they lose their identity, becoming a human slave at the service of the transnational companies and the economic powers. An objective analysis reveals that transhumanism is only an intellectual swindle that leads to digital fascism, a society where a millionaire elite will govern citizens with technological implants, who will be digital slaves at the service of an oligarchy."

This scrutiny is often portrayed as a tension between professional and managerial logics. Recently, medical autonomy has increasingly been shaped in terms of transparency, where publication of clinical performance (via ICT) might be a more pervasive form of surveillance. Such transparency may have the potential for a more explicit managerial logic but is contested by clinicians. This paper applies notions of surveillance to public reporting of cardiac surgery, involving the online publication of mortality rates of named surgeons. It draws on qualitative data from a case-study of cardiac surgeons in one hospital, incorporating interviews with health care managers and national policymakers in England. We examine how managerial logics are mediated by professional autonomy, generating patterns of enrolment, resistance and reactivity to public reporting. The managerial ‘gaze’ of public reporting is becoming widespread but the surgical specialty is accommodating it, leading to a re-assertion of knowledge, based on professional definitions. The paper assesses whether this form of surveillance is challenging to or being assimilated by the medical profession, thereby recasting the profession itself."

Koeszegi \nRecent developments in information and communication technology have led to renewed interest in the impact of flexible work on work-related outcomes such as job satisfaction, organizational identification and work engagement. Although there is a vast amount of literature indicating the positive association between job autonomy and work-related outcomes, there has been little discussion about the contextual conditions that strengthen this relationship. This paper analyzes the role of perceived organizational alignment as a conditional factor and shows that autonomy alone cannot explain an organization’s success in improving work-related outcomes. An analysis of online survey from 481 employees shows that the perceived organizational alignment moderates the positive effect of autonomy on work-related outcomes in the context of flexible work. For employees who perceive organizational alignment to be high, the positive relationships are strengthened for work engagement and organizational identification, but attenuated for job satisfaction. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed."

Drawing upon the Needs-Affordances-Features model, we investigate the mediating role of satisfaction of the innate psychological needs that are salient in the SNS context (i.e., need for relatedness, need for self-presentation, and need for autonomy). Based on an empirical study of 314 daily Facebook users, results reveal distinct effects of attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance on SNS addiction through the satisfaction of different psychological needs. Satisfaction of the need for relatedness and the need for self-presentation mediates the positive relationship between attachment anxiety and SNS addiction. Satisfaction of these needs also mediates the negative relationship between attachment avoidance and SNS addiction. Satisfaction of the need for autonomy mediates the positive relationship between attachment avoidance and SNS addiction. We conclude the study with the implications for research and practice."

The study utilizes the survey data collected in 2012 (n = 826) and 2016 (n = 1161) to identify the changes in factors that are important to the use of ICT in education. The study result shows that six teacher level factors that are important for the ICT integration have been improved over time through professional development activities. These are professional competency in educational use of ICT, collaboration for ICT integration, benefits on use of ICT, autonomy to innovate, recognition as a professional, and skills and practices in educational use of ICT. This provides supporting evidence to educational practitioners for the implementation of effective professional development programs to promote ICT integration in education, especially in the developing country’s context."

Gustafson \n Chenfang Wang \n Mahyar Garmsiri \n Lyle R. Wetsch \nHealth and human services professionals are increasingly using mobile devices to support clinical decision-making and evidence-based practice. However, research on self-directed learning in an era of growing digital technology utilization is underdeveloped. This study explored the adoption and use of mobile learning as a continuing professional development (CPD) activity.A mixed-methods case study using semistructured interviews and a web-based questionnaire was conducted with health and human services professionals in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada.Respondents reported using a smartphone (53.8%), tablets (50.4%), YouTube (43.0%), and mobile apps (35.8%) for CPD. The highest-rated benefits of mobile learning included improved access to information (M = 3.51); potential for enhanced knowledge acquisition (M = 3.45); staying up to date (M = 3.44); and verifying information (M = 3.40). The greatest barriers included cost of some apps and resources (M = 3.07); websites/programs not functional on mobile devices (M = 2.84); workplace barriers preventing access to digital resources (M = 2.82); and social media use linked to negative perceptions of professionalism (M = 2.65). Interview respondents described the flexibility and convenience of mobile learning, the level of autonomy it offered, and the advantages of learning on their own time. Technical issues, particularly for rural and remote practitioners, and digital professionalism also emerged as potential barriers.A systems model organizes the factors influencing the adoption and use of mobile devices and resources to support “just-in-time” learning. Addressing policies, practices, and regulations that enable or inhibit adoption of mobile learning for CPD may foster enhanced use to support better clinical decision-making, improved accuracy, and greater patient safety."

However, there is little research exploring the associations between ICT-related dispositions and science-related dispositions among adolescent students. Therefore, this study, employing a self-determination theory perspective, investigated the relationships of perceived competence in ICT usage and perceived autonomy related to ICT usage with dispositions toward science—enjoyment of science, interest in broad science topics, science self-efficacy, and epistemological beliefs about science—among 258,192 adolescent students from 10,767 schools in 42 PISA 2015 participating countries. Results of multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) analyses, after accounting for student-, school-, and country-level demographic characteristics, indicated that students’ perceived competence in ICT usage and perceived autonomy related to ICT usage were significantly positively related to their enjoyment of science, interest in broad science topics, science self-efficacy, and epistemological beliefs about science. Further, the results of the study revealed that students’ perceived autonomy related to ICT usage was more strongly associated with their dispositions toward science than perceived competence in ICT usage. Implications of the findings for policy and practice are discussed."

This is done with regard to a background study conducted for the purpose of collecting end user needs in order to inform design choices. Our design approach is influenced by the theory of Experience Design, in which design should be aimed at creating specific experiences. These experiences are considered to derive from a limited number of fundamental human needs. The study is framed as design research using the methodology of user-centred design as a guide for the creative process. Semi-structured focus group interviews were conducted with 25 older adults, identifying needs of autonomy, competence, relatedness, physical thriving, security, pleasure and stimulation. Design goals were set based on these needs and three interventions were designed and implemented accordingly."

It is a method of content dissemination and rapid learning through the application of UGC and Internet technology.Compared with traditional school education, online learning can obtain more resources, more autonomy, and no longer limited time and space for learning.Through the questionnaire, this paper finds that learners in the online education model still have some shortcomings in the learning process.For example, the learning process is not durable.Therefore, this paper uses neural network classification algorithm to analyze the related factors that affect the learning behavior of online education students.And propose corresponding control strategies for different influencing factors.By constructing a learning process control strategy model for large educational data, to help learners improve their learning efficiency, help the online education model break through the bottleneck, the online education industry has maintained rapid development.Finally, through the comparative analysis of the improved online education model and the traditional online education model, finding an improved online education model can better improve students’ interest in learning.Provided a reference for the development of online education,It also provides a reference for the transformation and upgrading of traditional education to online education."

    "text": "Doc 1030 :  La educación que limita es la que libera \nhttps://doi.org/10.22550/rep77-2-2019-01\n David Reyero \n Fernando Gil Cantero \nToday it is more common to find the concept of education linked to terms such as emancipation, autonomy, or freedom, than to norms, discipline, authority, submission or boundaries. This article sets out to show that limits, norms, rules, and even physical limitations are fundamental in education because they are an essential part of human reality and the human condition. Its main thesis is that rules not only regulate human activities from outside, but they also operate from the root of the activity itself as an expression of the peculiar rationality of human beings and their way of being in the world. The article firstly demonstrates this thesis by examining certain physical limitations that are approached educationally, and then in various other human areas, such as language, play, ecology, the Internet, and sexuality. It also shows how rules, by limiting the possibilities for how certain actions will develop, allow us to intuit or glimpse other types of limits and other possibilities —not always better ones— for human development and its standards. From an anthropological perspective, this has led us to suggest how an individual’s future possibilities expand, increase, and develop if her family, school and social settings for growth are spaces bounded by limits and norms. These allow her to feel safe enough to begin a process of critical assimilation of her received inheritance. The subject better understands reality, and the different possibilities for evaluating that reality, when the process of evaluation starts from a relatively enclosed perspective (with limits and norms) on the received tradition."

Naguib \nA critical demand for innovation in elderly care, especially in delivering the quality of service to elderlies, arises as many parts of the world are rapidly in transition to an elderly society. The advancement of robotic technologies, especially, in cognitive robotics and sociable human-robot interaction offers a great opportunity for meeting such demand. This paper presents the design and implementation of a next generation of elderly care robot, named as “HomeMate,” based on an innovative undertaking in its sociability and dependability with extensive user studies. The elderlies taken care of by Senior Welfare Centers are chosen as the target sector, for which the following five service scenarios are designed: infotainment, video chatting, game playing, medicine alarm and, in particular, errand services. Unlike conventional approaches, the scenarios are designed here to ensure the overall quality of service by maximizing the synergy under an elderly-caregiver-service robot ecosystem. The unique features implemented in HomeMate include 1) the principle of affordance in appearance design by matching functionality and anthropomorphism indices, 2) the sociability implemented by balancing between autonomy and user controllability as well as by integrating multimodal interactions into HomeMate avatar, and 3) the emphasis on dependability to inspire confidence on HomeMate as a trusted assistant, for which the principle of dependability is proposed and implemented with a cognitive framework. Experiments and user studies strongly support the proposed design principles and verify the dependability in performance."

It includes some theoretical considerations about autonomy and information and communication technologies as a source of information and self-management of knowledge. In line with this, reference is made to the theoretical and practical elements related to the creation and implementation of the self-access project. In this sense, the functions of the teacher-tutor in the transit of students through the different levels of autonomy are addressed and a general evaluation is made of the evidence of the impact of the implementation of this proposal."

An online survey was conducted to develop and empirically test a conceptual model that integrates the antecedents and outcomes of reactance against Facebook newsfeed ads. Specifically, the study employs Facebook users’ perceptions of autonomy, freedom threat, and intrusiveness as antecedents of reactance and measures two sub-constructs of reactance: negative cognitions and anger. As the outcomes of reactance, two types of ad avoidance are examined: cognitive and behavioral. The major findings reveal that users’ perceived autonomy decreases their perceptions of ad intrusiveness. Subsequently, ad intrusiveness and freedom threat to use Facebook have a positive effect on reactance, which influences ad avoidance. Theoretical and managerial implications are also discussed."

It was hypothesized that this form of social pressure is especially detrimental when it reduces self-control and hinders need satisfaction. Study 1 experimentally tested whether the fulfillment of intrinsic needs (i.e., autonomy, competence, and relatedness) in mobile communication mediates these associations. Results show that social pressure negatively affected autonomy and competence, but did not influence relatedness. Repeated-measures data from Study 2 suggest that social pressure leads to self-control failure, which is associated with reduced competence. This research is the first to develop and test a theoretical model of the effects of social pressure to be available on self-control, need satisfaction, and individuals’ well-being."

We applied convenience sampling technique and an online questionnaire to collect data. Descriptive statistics, multiple regression analysis, and Structural Equation Modelling using IBM SPSS AMOS were utilized. The findings provide that GPA, Personal Use of Facebook for Studying and Socialization, Autonomy Psychological Need, and Academic Procrastination foresee college students’ willingness to use Facebook in their courses. GPA and Personal Use of Facebook for studying are the most influential factors while Autonomy Psychological Need is the least impactful. We also examined the impact of these factors on different educational use types of Facebook: communication, collaboration, resources and material sharing. The results are discussed, and further recommendations for future research and implications are presented in the current study."

Grandon \n Muriel Ramírez-Santana \n Leonard Belmar Órdenes \nPrevious studies suggest that older adults are living increasingly alone and without the company of their close relatives, which cause them depression problems and a detriment to their health and general wellbeing. The use of social network sites (SNS) allows them to reduce their isolation, improve their social participation, and increase their autonomy. Although the adoption of various information technologies by older adults has been studied, some assumptions still predominate, for example, that older adults use SNS only for utilitarian purposes. However, considering SNS as hedonic information systems, and in order to extend the theoretical explanation of the intention to use hedonic systems to their actual use, this study aims to determine the influence of perceived enjoyment, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use on the use of SNS by elders in Concepción, Chile. Two hundred fifty-three older adults participated in the cross-sectional study. The results indicate that perceived ease of use is the variable that has the greatest total effect in explaining the use of SNS and that by adding the perceived enjoyment construct, the explanatory power of the model increases significantly. Therefore, advancement in user acceptance models, especially in the use of SNS by elders, can be made by focusing on the type of system, hedonic or utilitarian."

Samples were derived from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2015 survey. Configural, metric and scalar equivalence were found in a multigroup exploratory structural equation model. In the regression model, a significantly positive association between interest in ICT and student achievement was found in China, in contrast to a significantly negative association in Germany. All achievement scores were negatively and significantly correlated with perceived ICT competence scores in China, whereas science and mathematics achievement scores were not predicted by scores on ICT competence in Germany. Similar patterns were found in China and Germany in terms of perceived autonomy in using ICT and social relatedness in using ICT to predict students’ achievement. The implications of all the findings were discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]"

Since class time is sometimes limited, it is necessary to look for reinforcement tasks for students to properly develop literacy and communication skills. In addition, CMC is considered by scholars a new variety of language, with its own features and rules, one that students must master as well as other traditional language varieties. As secondary goals, this project intended to develop students’ motivation, autonomy, linguistic awareness and cooperative learning. By using a Mobile Instant Messaging (MIM) application, Remind, students were encouraged to communicate in groups and, thereby, supplement hours of practicing the foreign language outside the classroom, without limitation of time and space. Students evaluated the task by means of an online questionnaire and results proved to be positive, showing that they enjoyed the activity and considered it useful and effective. Moreover, they realised the importance of cooperative learning, of responsibility and of being aware of their own learning process. Likewise, the real and authentic purpose of communication enhanced motivation among students.</p>"

This study examined how general and cyber-specific parenting styles impact the prevalence of young adolescents’ involvement in cyberbullying as victims and/or perpetrators.One hundred and eighty 7th and 8th-grade Israeli students participated (Mean age = 13.25, SD = 0.81; 86 males, 89 females, 5 did not indicate gender). Adolescents reported the frequency of their involvement in cyberbullying, and whether their parents were using “autonomy-supportive” or “psychologically controlling” strategies generally and specifically when mediating internet use.A controlling parenting-style as well as an inconsistent internet-mediation style were associated with a higher prevalence of adolescent involvement in cyberbullying as victims and as perpetrators. Prevalence was higher when parents who generally use a controlling style were less controlling or consistent when mediating internet use.Despite the caveats related to parental control, parents who generally use a controlling style should consistently use this style while mediating cyber. Inconsistent parenting style conveys messages concerning internet activities that contradict what teens are accustomed to receiving in other contexts. This inconsistency may encourage them to exploit their relative freedom in the cyber context and act irresponsibly."

We review research ethics and regulations and outline the implications for maintaining participant privacy, respecting participant autonomy, and promoting researcher transparency when using social media to locate and track participants. We offer a rubric that can be used in future studies to determine ethical and regulation-consistent use of social media platforms and illustrate the rubric using our study team’s experience with Facebook. We also offer recommendations for both researchers and institutional review boards that emphasize the importance of well-described procedures for social media use as part of informed consent."

They should maintain the learning environment and activities to support LA. This research aimed to find out teachersâ€™ attitudes towards their roles and learning practices to support LA. A questionnaire was administered to 19 teachers who are studying for a Masters degree at UPI. It is found that teachers rated their responsibilities in choosing classroom activities and evaluating studentsâ€™ progress at the highest point. However, they viewed studentsâ€™ decision making abilities in choosing learning objectives and evaluating their learning at the lowest score. Furthermore, the activities which teachers often recommended to are listen to English songs, read books and use the internet. It can be concluded that teachers have a strong belief towards their roles in LA. Even though they are already conscious about the importance of LA, it should be implemented into practice."

Learning management systems, such as Moodle, used to create and deliver courses, facilitate e-learning in different types of educational institutions. Blended learning as a combination of face-to face and e-learning is conducive to deep learning. We designed a new course “Teaching English as a foreign language to learners with special educational needs” to provide students enrolled in a master’s programme – pre-service English teachers, with an opportunity to enhance their language and professional skills as well as to develop their learner autonomy through meaningful learning experiences blending learning can supplement. We considered micro, meso and macro levels of the course implementation and functioning. In this paper we describe the context in which the course is introduced by providing information about the setting, the curriculum, the need for including this course in the master’s programme at the faculty of foreign languages. We also outline the way the course is designed, including its structure, particular tasks and assessment procedures and present students’ feedback about the impact of the course on their foreign language skills and learner autonomy. The results indicate that blended learning is an effective tool for development of pre-service teachers’ English language skills and learner autonomy. The findings of the study can be applied by faculty and administrators involved in the design of courses at tertiary level."

The purpose of this paper is to provide an outline of how core values of the health systems, such as the principles of biomedical ethics, are in a supportive or conflicting relation to cybersecurity.,This paper claims that it is possible to map the desiderata relevant to cybersecurity onto the four principles of medical ethics, i.e. beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy and justice, and explore value conflicts in that way.,With respect to the question of how these principles should be balanced, there are reasons to think that the priority of autonomy relative to beneficence and non-maleficence in contemporary medical ethics could be extended to value conflicts in health-related cybersecurity.,However, the tension between autonomy and justice, which relates to the desideratum of usability of information and communication technology systems, cannot be ignored even if one assumes that respect for autonomy should take priority over other moral concerns.,In terms of value conflicts, most discussions in healthcare deal with the conflict of balancing efficiency and privacy given the sensible nature of health information. In this paper, the authors provide a broader and more detailed outline."

In order to accomplish this goal, it was necessary to build a theoretical framework that explored the context of higher education under the assumptions of the Bologna process and educative policies, exploring the encouragement to students’ autonomy and the use of ICT in the teaching and learning process. A quantitative exploratory approach was adopted with the purpose of collecting the insights of teachers involved in two courses of the Portuguese public higher education. The data collection was made through the curricular plans and though a survey to the teachers. With this research, we conclude that teachers reveal efforts to enhance students’ autonomy and feel motivated to use ICT in their educational practices. The most frequently mentioned motivations are that ICT facilitates the access to resources and information, innovates their practice, improves the regulation, tutoring and intervention, and in interaction and communication. Teachers also appear to hold positive perceptions on the potential of ICT to support their teaching and learning process, especially the perception of utility and ease of use of ICT."

Writing in 2004, Mike Featherstone suggests that the “automobile becomes a new form of communications platform with a complex set of possibilities.” In this article, we argue that the notion of the car as a communication platform continues to form a productive way of thinking about autonomous vehicles. The argument we develop is that the dual roles of data acquisition and management, and local processing are integral to any understanding of the contemporary autonomous vehicle’s “machinic complex.” Both of these things are strongly associated with autonomy and the transformation of cars into decision-making machines. We use the example of mapping to argue that these capacities are not unique to the emerging technologies of autonomous vehicles; however, they are essential to them, with significant implications not only for their capabilities as communications platforms, but also more generally for their governance and political economy."

Aloysius \n Ankur Arora \n Viswanath Venkatesh \nRetailers are implementing technology-enabled mobile checkout processes in their stores to improve service quality, decrease labor costs and gain operational efficiency. These new checkout processes have increased customer convenience primarily by providing them autonomy in sales transactions in that store employee interventions play a reduced role. However, this autonomy has the unintended consequence of altering the checks and balances inherent in a traditional employee-assisted checkout process. Retailers, already grappling with shoplifting, with an estimated annual cost of billions of dollars, fear that the problem may be exacerbated by mobile checkout and concomitant customer autonomy. The purpose of this paper is to understand the effect of mobile checkout processes in retail stores on cybercrime in the form of shoplifting enabled by a technology transformed the retail environment.,The authors conducted an online survey of a US sample recruited from a crowdsourced platform. The authors test a research model that aims to understand the factors that influence the intention to shoplift in three different mobile checkout settings − namely, smartphone checkout settings, store-provided mobile device checkout settings, and employee-assisted mobile checkout settings − and compare it with a traditional fixed location checkout setting.,The authors found that, in a smartphone checkout setting, intention to shoplift was driven by experiential beliefs and peer influence, and experiential beliefs and peer influence had a stronger effect for prospective shoplifters when compared to experienced shoplifters; in a store-provided mobile devices checkout setting, experiential beliefs had a negative effect on shoplifters’ intention to shoplift and the effect was weaker for prospective shoplifters when compared to experienced shoplifters. The results also indicated that in an employee-assisted mobile checkout setting, intention to shoplift was driven by experiential beliefs and peer influence, and experiential beliefs had a stronger effect for prospective shoplifters when compared to experienced shoplifters.,This study is the among the first, if not first, to examine shoplifters’ intention to shoplift in mobile checkout settings. We provide insights into how those who may not have considered shoplifting in less favorable criminogenic settings may change their behavior due to the autonomy provided by mobile checkout settings and also provide an understanding of the shoplifting intention for both prospective and experienced shoplifters in different mobile checkout settings."

Students’ out-of-class learning is linked to improved class performance and constitutes an important part of learner development. Prior research has argued that learning-resources provision should encourage students’ autonomous learning both in and out of the classroom [Benson, 2013; Benson & Reinders, 2011; Gardner & Miller, 1999; Little, 1997; Richards, 2015]. However, work on autonomy often proceeds via generalities rather than focusing on its enactment in individual behavior. Accordingly, this study investigated 35 EFL undergraduates’ autonomous learning behaviors and their use of resources of the learning center of a university. Data were collected via email interviews with the participants and examination of their resources-usage records. Content analysis of the interview data, using six categories based on a learner-autonomy model, was used to generate each participant’s autonomy score. Spearman rho testing of the relationship between those scores and the students’ resources-usage scores suggested a very strong positive relationship between autonomous learning behaviors and overall usage of resources, as well as the variety of those resources used by individuals. Data analysis also revealed that, to varying degrees, each participant’s autonomous-learning behaviors (based on qualitative examples) fell into more than one of the six learner-autonomy types. Based on these findings, it is recommended that students be encouraged to learn beyond the classroom through pedagogical activities that link classroom learning to learning-center resources. Based on the findings of this study we make suggestions on pedagogical design with SAC and applications for SACs in other educational contexts."

Considering this, the purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of WIL on workplace outcome variables such as employee satisfaction (ES) and employee productivity in the Malaysian context. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire that yielded 282 responses. Partial least square technique using SmartPLS-3 was used to test the study hypotheses. Findings Findings reveal that workplace WIL, workplace WIL policy and workplace autonomy orientation (WAO) affect employees’ satisfaction. Additionally, the mediating role of ES was found to be significant. Practical implications The findings of this study are valuable for both managers and policy makers. These results can benefit the managers of conventional banks in Malaysia to decide how to enhance employees’ satisfaction and productivity by focusing on the key drivers such as WIL, workplace internet leisure policy (WILP) and WAO. Originality/value This is a pioneering study which suggests that moderate use of WIL can have a positive and significant effect on workplace outcome variables. Moreover, this study theorised ES as a mediating variable; this helps to explain how organisations can transform workplace resources in term of internet leisure, WILP and WAO into high productivity by elevating employees’ satisfaction."

Heutagogy (or self-determined learning) provides a promising framework for capitalizing on these developing trends, drawing on established learner-centred education theories that strongly emphasize learner autonomy. The key principles of heutagogy – learner agency, self-efficacy and capability, reflection and metacognition, and non-linear learning – provide a foundation for designing and developing learning ecologies, the potential of which can be further maximized through the use of digital media. This article describes the theory of heutagogy and the learner-centred pedagogies on which the theory is founded, as well as providing an explanation of the pedagogy-andragogy-heutagogy (PAH) continuum and its use in developing student skills. It also explores the role of social media in supporting the development of those skills."

CRES belong to critical cybernetic information systems (CCIS) built on the basis of open network models. In the early 80s of the 20th century, this approach did not consider the need to build a security system, which does not allow it to provide the required level of protection against modern hybrid threats. The transition to autonomy in decision-making, education and university management all over the world places requirements to ensuring the required quality of service (QoS) of CRES clients. CRES users include university administration, faculty, students and support personnel of educational services in higher education institutions. One of the main criteria for QoS is information security. However, there is no general approach to building integrated information security in CRES, which would provide the required level of security. The methodology is based on the concept of synthesizing a synergistic model of threats to CCIS, improved models of CRES infrastructure, an intruder, assessing the current state of information security (IS) and improved method of investment in the CRES IS. It is shown that the basis of the synergistic model is a three-level model of strategic security management, which provides a synergistic effect in the context of simultaneous threats to information security, cybersecurity and security of information. In contrast to the known, such an approach provides for the determination of qualitatively new and previously unknown emergent properties of the information security system, taking into account the means used to create it. The application of the methodology in practice through the development and implementation of new solutions to provide security services allows for the required level of information security in CRES. The proposed information security service mechanisms are built on hybrid cryptosystems based on crypto-code structures with  flawed codes."

While these worries are familiar to privacy researchers, this paper aims to make them more salient to policymakers—first, by defining “online manipulation”, thus enabling identification of manipulative practices; and second, by drawing attention to the specific harms online manipulation threatens. We argue that online manipulation is the use of information technology to covertly influence another person’s decision-making, by targeting and exploiting their decision-making vulnerabilities. Engaging in such practices can harm individuals by diminishing their economic interests, but its deeper, more insidious harm is its challenge to individual autonomy. We explore this autonomy harm, emphasising its implications for both individuals and society, and we briefly outline some strategies for combating online manipulation and strengthening autonomy in an increasingly digital world."

While increased channels of communication and worldwide access have their benefits, there are also risks and problems associated with a virtual platform that gives instant access to information. This Article centers on “revenge porn,” one problem associated with online communications that has drawn the attention of both the media and the legal community. Revenge porn is the practice of distributing nude or sexually explicit photos or videos of an individual without his or her consent. It is usually posted by a former lover in order to harm, humiliate, or otherwise seek revenge upon the subject of the material after the relationship has ended. This issue implicates principles of sexual autonomy, particularly for women: if we want to encourage sexual freedom, we must protect people from others’ abuse of that freedom. Legal actors are divided on how best to approach the revenge porn problem. Some advocate for civil action in order to compensate victims, while others believe that drafting new criminal laws and punishing offenders is the correct answer. Still others believe that no action is required at all, blaming the victims of revenge porn instead of the distributors. This Article addresses the legal possibilities, weighing their benefits and detractors in order to decide the proper solution for revenge porn in the U.S. It concludes that, while the criminal law is the appropriate forum for revenge porn litigation, new statues are both problematic and unnecessary. Instead of drafting targeted revenge porn legislation, police and prosecutors should pursue offenders utilizing existing laws, such as harassment, extortion, and cyber-stalking."

This study aims to investigate the image of the nurse among year 4 and 5 high school students.Two groups of students were interviewed, one at their institution without any previous orientation (n = 102) and one at the University of Bologna during orientation day (n = 388). A validated questionnaire (Nursing Attitude Questionnaire) of 30 items was delivered. Two additional questions were added to explore the possibility of advising relatives and acquaintances to become a nurse and therefore to choose the nursing degree course.All areas of the NAQ scored significantly higher in the group where students attended the orientation day, especially the ones related to the professional role, stereotypes and professional value items. Female students ≥ 21 had a more positive image of the nurse. Both groups recognized that nurses are important figures for patients and that they are intelligent people, who must have a degree in order to carry out their work duties. Differences between the groups were recorded. Students in group 1 did not accept nursing autonomy while students in group 2 understood differences between nursing and medical careers, attributing to them the same value. A positive correlation between the positive image of the nursing profession and the interest in becoming nurses or advising others to undertake the nursing course was found. In conclusion, orientation is effective in helping high school students in the choice of their university courses. Regarding nursing, strategies to improve the image of the nurse and enrollment should be combined during orientation day with current up to date communication and learning tools, such as social media and simulation laboratories. Furthermore, it appears increasingly important to extend orientation and tutoring activities to junior high school students, families and teachers."

Achieving excellent reading proficiency, which is related not only to a student’s inherent talent but also to various impact factors, can greatly enhance the effectiveness of reading education. The Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2015 provides an international view on the reading proficiency of 15-year-olds in a computer-based testing environment. In this study, a multiple linear regression model was constructed using the computing language R to investigate the association between student-level ICT impact factors (the availability of ICT, the use of ICT and attitudes toward ICT) and reading proficiency among early adolescents. The sample included 37,155 15-year-olds from five representative countries with extremely high reading proficiency. The results showed that the students’ ICT-related attitudinal factors concerning their interest in ICT and perceived autonomy in using ICT, rather than ICT availability and ICT use, were closely associated with high reading proficiency. In addition, ICT devices should be integrated not only as instructional media but also as a cognitive tool for teaching reading with timely and appropriate scrutiny."

This article departs from a leader-centric analysis and the liberal frame that still largely informs assessment of political action, to foreground “fun” as a salient aspect of right-wing mobilization. Building on ethnographic fieldwork among the Hindu nationalists in India, I argue that fun is a metapractice that shapes the interlinked practices of fact-checking, abuse, assembly, and aggression among online volunteers for the right-wing movement. Furthermore, fun remains crucial for an experience of absolute autonomy among online users in ideological battles. Providing the daily drip feed for exclusion, fun as a metapractice bears a formal similarity to objectivity in its performative effects of distance and deniability."

However, some patients and informal caregivers are not waiting for the health care system to redesign itself. These individuals are sometimes referred to as e-patients. The first generation of e-patients used the internet for finding information and for communicating with peers. Compared with the first generation, the second generation of e-patients collects their own health data and appears to be more innovative. Objective The aim of this study was to describe the second generation of e-patients through exploration of their active engagement in their self-care and health care. Methods Semistructured interviews were conducted with 10 patients with chronic conditions and 5 informal caregivers. They were all recruited through a Web-based advertisement. Data were analyzed according to the framework analysis approach, using the 3 concepts of the self-determination theory—autonomy, relatedness, and competence—at the outset. Results Study participants were actively engaged in influencing their self-care and the health care system to improve their own health, as well as the health of others. This occurred at different levels, such as using their own experience when giving presentations and lectures to health care professionals and medical students, working as professional peers in clinical settings, performing self-tracking, contributing with innovations, and being active on social media. When interaction with health care providers was perceived as being insufficient, the participants sought support through their peers, which showed strong relatedness. Competence increased through the use of technology and learning experiences with peers. Their autonomy was important but was sometimes described as involuntary and to give up was not an option for them. Conclusions Like the first generation of e-patients, the participants frequently searched for Web-based information. However, the second generation of e-patients also produce their own health data, which they learn from and share. They also engage in the innovation of digital tools to meet health-related needs. Utilizing technological developments comes naturally to the second generation of e-patients, even if the health care system is not prepared to support them under these new circumstances."

    "text": "Doc 1060 :  Maps and the Autonomous Vehicle as a Communication Platform \n\n R Wilken \n Julian Thomas \nOver the past two decades, there has been growing awareness of and critical interest in the convergence of information and communication technologies and automobiles. Writing in 2004, Mike Featherstone suggests that the automobile becomes a new form of communications platform with a complex set of possibilities. In this article, we argue that the notion of the car as a communication platform continues to form a productive way of thinking about autonomous vehicles. The argument we develop is that the dual roles of data acquisition and management, and local processing are integral to any understanding of the contemporary autonomous vehicle’s machinic complex. Both of these things are strongly associated with autonomy and the transformation of cars into decision-making machines. We use the example of mapping to argue that these capacities are not unique to the emerging technologies of autonomous vehicles; however, they are essential to them, with significant implications not only for their capabilities as communications platforms, but also more generally for their governance and political economy."

This is characterised by advanced flexibility, learner autonomy and extensive use of digital technologies to enhance learning outcomes. The main feature of such methodology is the physical distance between teaching staff, peers and educational institutions. Various technological tools are used to bridge this distance and improve communication and interaction. This article attempts to review the literature in the field, with the aim of highlighting strategies for enhancing communication and interaction in online learning environments. After discussing the theoretical framework for online communication and interaction, the authors outline the factors involved in creating well-structured, interactive and dynamic online courses and programmes for higher education students. The article explores the multi-dimensional aspects of communication in online learning environments and the differing forms of interaction involved. Using qualitative methods, the authors’ aim is to produce a framework to help tutors and instructional designers develop more effective online courses in higher education. In addition, this article may be of value to researchers and scholar-practitioners interested in communication issues, to online learning designers, and to institutional managers recruiting teaching staff for online educational courses."

This work aimed at investigating how the Virtual University Institute (UFC Virtual), connected to the Federal University of Ceara in partnership with The Open University of Brazil (UAB), enables licentiate degree students to learn how to speak English. The corpus of this research is the English Language – Oral Production and Oral Comprehension course, offered during the third term of the undergraduate program, between March and May 2018. In this qualitative study, we develop a participant observation, accessing the website Solar, a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE), in order to analyze which resources were available for students to chat between them and with their tutor. We verify which type of interactions were offered in the platform: synchronous (communication in real time); asynchronous (learning opportunities that can be accessed at any time); or multi-synchronous (combining the two forms of delivery). We exam, as well, the scripts provided during the speaking tasks, aiming at identifying if the students would practice authentic conversations, or if they would repeat previous formulated phrases. The results show that the learners did not have opportunities to communicate in real time at a distance English learning environment from Solar, nor to receive corrections or synchronic feedback from the tutor. We also confirm that the scripted tasks could allow the students to not engage in spontaneous dialogues."

Largely because consent has an almost deferential power as a proxy for consumer choice, organizations increasingly use consent as a de facto standard for demonstrating privacy commitments. The Department of Health and Human Services and the Federal Trade Commission have integrated the concept of consent into health care, research, and general commercial activities. Despite consent’s prominence in U.S. law, this article seeks to understand, more fully, consent’s origins and development, then applies a philosophical-legal lens to clearly identify problems with consent in its current use. Jurgen Habermas’ theory of communicative action as it applies to private and public spheres and Helen Nissenbaum’s model for contextual inquiry provide useful lenses for understanding the impact of consent on human autonomy. This article suggests five resulting problems for human autonomy, the “consent myth,” and four principles for addressing these problems in contemporary health technologies, such as Internet of Health Things (IoHT) and artificial intelligence (AI) applications."

This study considered teachers as part of a project using rubrics in Moodle to evaluate learning in a Chilean higher education institution in 2014, 2015 and 2016. Forming and evaluating in a competency-based approach involves challenges for the teaching staff and changes in their role that are accepted or resisted. The same happens in the face of innovation processes with information and communication technologies (ICT) integration in teaching practices. The primary results show a relationship between pedagogical beliefs and evaluation which is consistent with adoption and assessment of the digital tool used. In addition, it reveals the role of beliefs as secondary barriers to change in the face of access or primary barriers (Ertmert, 1999). The value of autonomy in student work and feedback are identified as key beliefs in technology adoption."

This paper aims to investigate the Malaysian public and private universities degree of independence and autonomy from the government and other external forces. The extent of an institute’s autonomy is measured based on their independent in appointive, academic, administrative, and financial matters. An emailed survey has been sent to top-level management of 28 public and private universities in Malaysia, resulting in 126 respondents. The respondents for the survey consisted of vice-chancellors, deputy vice-chancellors, deans, directors, and deputy deans. Using SPSS statistical software, data were analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistical analysis. The results demonstrate that the majority of the components under academic matters, administrative and financial matters are considered high autonomy, with less interference of the government over those institutions. With some reason, autonomy related to the appointment of the vice-chancellors and dismissals of rectors and vice-chancellors is still under government control. However, based on the findings, autonomy development at public and private universities in Malaysia has been engaged in a long journey that enabled it to compete and to progress well at the global level."

McNeese \n Nancy J. Cooke \nThe focus of this current research is two-fold: (1) to understand how team interaction in human-autonomy teams (HAT)s evolve in the Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) task context, and (2) to understand how HATs respond to three types of failures (automation, autonomy, and cyber-attack) over time. We summarize the findings from three of our recent experiments regarding the team interaction within HAT over time in the dynamic context of RPAS. For the first and the second experiments, we summarize general findings related to team member interaction of a three-member team over time, by comparison of HATs with all-human teams. In the third experiment, which extends beyond the first two experiments, we investigate HAT evolution when HATs are faced with three types of failures during the task. For all three of these experiments, measures focus on team interactions and temporal dynamics consistent with the theory of interactive team cognition. We applied Joint Recurrence Quantification Analysis, to communication flow in the three experiments. One of the most interesting and significant findings from our experiments regarding team evolution is the idea of entrainment, that one team member (the pilot in our study, either agent or human) can change the communication behaviors of the other teammates over time, including coordination, and affect team performance. In the first and second studies, behavioral passiveness of the synthetic teams resulted in very stable and rigid coordination in comparison to the all-human teams that were less stable. Experimenter teams demonstrated metastable coordination (not rigid nor unstable) and performed better than rigid and unstable teams during the dynamic task. In the third experiment, metastable behavior helped teams overcome all three types of failures. These summarized findings address three potential future needs for ensuring effective HAT: (1) training of autonomous agents on the principles of teamwork, specifically understanding tasks and roles of teammates, (2) human-centered machine learning design of the synthetic agent so the agents can better understand human behavior and ultimately human needs, and (3) training of human members to communicate and coordinate with agents due to current limitations of Natural Language Processing of the agents."

As a broad term, of science embraces in research, learning, teachingand publication. All of these activities should be dedicated to identifying the truth and learning about the truth. Design/methodology/approach – Three theoretical approaches are of importance for framing issues related to of science, which in this paper are integrated into the framework of mindset agency theory: is a value; is claimed by agents who pursue specific interests (goals), which might constrain others; and individuals are agents who are interacting with each other within a social system–cooperation, ignorance or conflict. Findings – Freedom as a value is at the core of intellectual autonomy. Intellectual autonomy is a necessarycondition for innovation and advancement of knowledge. The observable modes of interaction/coexistenceamong researchers are influenced by individual research goals and by the researchers’ access to resources, which may be deliberately constrained by opponents or other researchers as competitors. Research limitations/implications – For further research, which is beyond this paper, the authors can refer to: analyses of challenges of freedom – in terms of ethics, protection of individual humanrights, political pressures and conflicts of interests; the issues of truth, i.e. the impact of fake news andcreation of alternate facts; and the relation between academic and employment (academic tenure) inpresent-day societies. Owing to lack of space, this paper cannot deal with the danger emerging from powerful organisations or powerful individuals, who are challenging of science. Social implications–If there is no of science then social progress is constrained. If there is no access to right data, decisions will be wrong. Originality/value – So far, a comprehensive cybernetic model was not published, which supports systems thinking about scholars and teachers (inter)acting in research organisations."

However, it remains unclear how parental media monitoring is associated with exposure to prosocial violent content and adolescent behavior. Accordingly, 1,193 adolescents were asked about parental media monitoring, media content exposure, and behavior. Main findings suggest that autonomy supportive restrictive monitoring was associated with lower levels of exposure to prosocial violent content, but only among older adolescents. Additionally, autonomy supportive restrictive monitoring was the only form of parental media monitoring associated with lower levels of violent content and higher levels of prosocial content, and autonomy supportive active monitoring was the only parental monitoring strategy that promoted prosocial behavior via exposure to prosocial media content. Discussion focuses on the importance of autonomy supportive parental monitoring, as well as the implications of parents encouraging their children to watch media with limited violent content-even if it is prosocial violent content."

The fact that there is broad evidence in favor of IMIs and that IMIs have already been implemented in several countries requires an ethical analysis to answer these concerns. OBJECTIVE The objective is to tackle ethical issues connected to a possible implementation of IMIs for mental disorders in Germany and to point out possible solutions. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted an ethical analysis using the criteria of well-being of patients, non-maleficence, justice, and patient autonomy, based on the empirical evidence. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION The ethical analysis showed that IMIs for mental disorders principally have a positive effect on the well-being of patients and have a low risk of impairment. Additionally, IMIs can minimize risk, improve justice, and strengthen autonomy of mentally ill patients. Despite the broad evidence, there are still research desiderates with respect to ethical aspects, e. g. patient information for mentally ill patients."

Accordingly, the right to FoT receives absolute protection under international human rights law. However, this foundational right has been neither significantly developed nor often utilized. The contours of this right urgently need to be defined due to twenty-first century threats to FoT posed by new technologies. As such, this paper draws on law and psychology to consider what the right to FoT should be in the twenty-first century. After discussing contemporary threats to FoT, and recent developments in our understanding of thought that can inform the development of the right, this paper considers three elements of the right; the rights not to reveal one’s thoughts, not to be penalized for one’s thoughts, and not to have one’s thoughts manipulated. The paper then considers, for each element, why it should exist, how the law currently treats it, and challenges that will shape it going forward. The paper concludes that the law should develop the right to FoT with the clear understanding that what this aims to secure is mental autonomy. This process should hence begin by establishing the core mental processes that enable mental autonomy, such as attentional and cognitive agency. The paper argues that the domain of the right to FoT should be extended to include external actions that are arguably constitutive of thought, including internet searches and diaries, hence shielding them with absolute protection. It is stressed that law must protect us from threats to FoT from both states and corporations, with governments needing to act under the positive aspect of the right to ensure societies are structured to facilitate mental autonomy. It is suggested that in order to support mental autonomy, information should be provided in autonomy-supportive contexts and friction introduced into decision making processes to facilitate second-order thought. The need for public debate about how society wishes to balance risk and mental autonomy is highlighted, and the question is raised as to whether the importance attached to thought has changed in our culture. The urgency of defending FoT is re-iterated."

This study investigates the emerging patterns of PCC that occur in an mHealth-based diabetes prevention program for older adults. The analysis of user-coach communication data during the 16-week period of the program revealed four PCC strategies employed by coaches: (a) triggering reflections on users’ routinized habits, (b) jointly determining a measurable health goal, (c) facilitating self-evaluations on recent behavior change, and (d) tailoring programs to adapt to users’ lifestyle and health status. To advance these strategies, coaches utilized various mHealth features that helped them (a) engage in data-driven coaching, (b) increase situational awareness of users’ health conditions and routines, (c) provide continuous support to users through regular and spontaneous in-app chats, and (d) foster user autonomy and engagement. The findings extend implications for developing technology-enabled healthcare practice to enhance self-management of chronic illness."

Generally, classical control systems are used for static environments, where external disturbances and changes in internal parameters can be fully modulated before or neglected during operation. However, classical control systems are inadequate at addressing environmental uncertainty. By contrast, autonomous systems, which were first studied in the field of control systems, can be applied in an unknown environment. This paper summarizes the state of the art autonomous systems by first discussing the definition, modeling, and system structure of autonomous systems and then providing a perspective on how autonomous systems can be integrated with advanced resources (e.g., the Internet of Things, big data, Over-the-Air, and federated learning). Finally, what comes after reaching full autonomy is briefly discussed."

The self-organization phenomenon in natural ecosystems, the Cyber Movement Organizations (CMOs) on the Internet, and the Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI), and so on, can all be regarded as its early manifestations. In recent years, the rapid development of blockchain technology has spawned the emergence of the so-called Decentralized Autonomous Organization [DAO, sometimes labeled as Decentralized Autonomous Corporation (DAC)], which is a new organization form that the management and operational rules are typically encoded on blockchain in the form of smart contracts, and can autonomously operate without centralized control or third-party intervention. DAO is expected to overturn the traditional hierarchical management model and significantly reduce organizations’ costs on communication, management, and collaboration. However, DAO still faces many challenges, such as security and privacy issue, unclear legal status, and so on. In this article, we strive to present a systematic introduction of DAO, including its concept and characteristics, research framework, typical implementations, challenges, and future trends. Especially, a novel reference model for DAO which employs a five-layer architecture is proposed. This article is aimed at providing helpful guidance and reference for future research efforts."

The implementation of the level of automation in these systems from being manually controlled to fully autonomous would depend upon the autonomy approach chosen to design these systems. This article reviews the historical evolution of autonomy, its approaches, and the current trends in related fields to build robust autonomous systems. Toward such a goal and with the increased number of cyberattacks, the security of these systems needs special attention from the research community. To gauge the extent to which research has been done in this area, we discuss the cybersecurity of these systems. It is essential to model the system from a security perspective, identify the threats and vulnerabilities, and then model the attacks. A survey in this direction explores the theoretical/analytical system and attack models that have been proposed over the years and identifies the research gap that needs to be addressed by the research community."

In these processes, information and communication technologies (ICTs) improve accessibility. Our aim was to use ICT, especially social media, in pedagogical activities developed for students with VI (blindness and low vision). Focus group interviews about technology use showed us that these students are heavy users of WhatsApp, an instant messenger app. We then established an online discussion group, as a community of practice, using WhatsApp as a discussion environment. This online group helped Brazilian students with VI develop social skills and discuss health issues they considered important to them."

A comparison is also made between digital, information and media competences, current development trends and future trends. The differences and requirements between qualified media users and qualified users of information technology are becoming less and less distinct. The 3 generations of Media education - 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 were described. The main purpose of media education in the first phase of development, referred to as media education 1.0, was to develop not only critical thinking skills towards the media and media messages, but also - in a general sense - critical attitude and autonomy. Media 2.0 education can be discussed in connection with the dynamic development of the Internet and information and communication technologies, including social media, at the beginning of the 21st century.

    "text": "Doc 1081 :  The Problem of Platform Law: Pluralistic Legal Ordering on Social Media \nhttps://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3454222\n Molly K. Land \nThe internet would seem to be an ideal platform for fostering the development of multiple overlapping communities seeking to be governed by their own norms. The very structure of the internet resists centralized governance, while the opportunities it provides for the “long tail” of expression means even voices with extremely small audiences can find a home. In reality, however, the governance of online speech looks much more monolithic. This is largely a result of private “lawmaking” activity by internet intermediaries. Increasingly, social media companies like Facebook and Twitter are developing what David Kaye, United Nations (“UN”) Special Rapporteur for the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression, has called “platform law.” Through a combination of community standards, contract, technological design, and case-specific practice, social media companies are developing “Facebook law” and “Twitter law” displacing the laws of national jurisdictions.\nUsing the example of content moderation, this paper makes several contributions to the literature. First, it expands upon the idea of “platform law” to consider the broad array of mechanisms that companies use to control user behavior and mediate conflicts. Second, using human rights law as a foundation, the paper makes the case for meaningful technological design choices that enable user autonomy. Users should be able to make explicit choices about who and what they want to hear online. It also frames user choice in terms of the right to hear, not the right to speak, as a way of navigating the tension presented by hate speech and human rights without resorting to platform law that sanitizes speech for everyone."

The selected brand is Three Times a Day (a culinary blog whose mission is to encourage a healthier diet). This study aims to identify food-related behavioral changes as a result of consumers’ relationship with this brand and identify antecedents to such changes. Design/methodology/approach A netnography of the brand online community and 14 individual in-depth interviews were conducted. Findings Netnography results identify four categories of behavioral changes emerging from the relationship with the brand (e.g. choosing healthier/more varied foods, developing an interest in cooking and adopting a healthier lifestyle). Analysis of the individual interviews substantiate the role of brand attachment as a driver of positive change and identify three antecedents: brand-self connection (through past, actual and ideal self), brand exposure and satisfaction of individual needs (i.e. autonomy, competence and relatedness). Research limitations/implications Results enrich the literature on behavioral change and highlight the positive role of a brand in the context of improving eating habits. Findings extend the understanding of the consequences of attachment beyond its influence at the attitudinal level by focusing on concrete consumer behavior. Social implications It is recognized that despite good intentions, individuals keep making poor food choices. This important issue is associated with several diseases and increasing social costs. This research explores how to influence consumers in adopting better eating habits. Originality/value This study is one of the first to examine the power of a food-related brand to enhance positive eating practices and improve diet."

The combination of AI and cybersecurity is at the sharp edge of this development and raises many ethical questions and dilemmas. In this commentary, I analyse how we can understand the ethics of AI and cybersecurity in relation to sovereignty and strategic autonomy. The analysis is followed by policy recommendations, some of which may appear to be controversial, such as the strategic use of ethics. I conclude with a reflection on underlying concepts as an invitation for further research. The goal is to inspire policy-makers, academics and business strategists in their work, and to be an input for public debate."

Boydell \n Quang Vinh Nguyen \n Emery Schubert \n Laura Dunne \n Tanya Meade \nBackground Suicide is one of the most frequent causes of death in young people worldwide. Depression lies at the root of this issue, a condition that has a significant negative impact on the lives of those who experience it and on society more generally. However, 80% of affected young people do not obtain professional help for depression and other mental health issues. Therefore, a key challenge is to find innovative and appealing ways to engage young people in learning to manage their mental health. Research suggests that young people prefer to access anonymous Web-based programs rather than get face-to-face help, which has led to the development of numerous smartphone apps. However, the evidence indicates that not all of these apps are effective in engaging the interest of young people who are most in need of help. Objective The study aimed to investigate young people’s response to six currently available smartphone apps for mental health and to identify features that young people like and dislike in such apps. Methods Focus groups were conducted with 23 young people aged 13 to 25 years in which they viewed and used six smartphone apps for mental health. A general inductive approach following a realist paradigm guided data analysis. Results The results revealed that young people value autonomy and the opportunity to personalize experiences with these apps above other things. Finding a balance between simplicity and informativeness is also an important factor. Conclusions App developers need to consider using participant-design frameworks to ensure that smartphone apps are providing what young people want in a mental health app. Solutions to the need for personalization and increasing user engagement are also crucially needed."

I acknowledge the knowledge of the Indigenous peoples of this land and of every land that were colonized, chattelized, racialized, victimized, pulverized, dehumanized, genocidized, proletarianized, lumpenized, marginalized, and homogenized with the tools of criminology, among other tools, for the benefits of white-supremacist imperialist patriarchy. I testify that we are survivors who were never expected to survive to meet one another and raise our voices to say, Happy Survival! To say that we are survivors is not to suggest that we have completely restored our independence but to state that for as long as the forces of imperialism are entrenched, we are determined to resist. We will keep speaking truth to unjust power the way that our ancestors defiantly stuck out their tongues and flipped their middle fingers to force the conquerors to sign treaties recognizing our autonomy as human beings equal in beauty, wisdom, culture, courage and originality.

A total of 146 Chinese undergraduates completed questionnaires on autonomy-supportive parenting, need satisfaction and Internet addiction. RSA data were also obtained. Path analysis was used to test the proposed mediation and moderated mediation models. The results indicated that while the impact of perceived autonomy-supportive parenting on Internet addiction was mediated by need satisfaction, RSA moderated this indirect effect. The indirect effect of autonomy-supportive parenting on Internet addiction via need satisfaction was much stronger in adults with low levels of RSA than in those with high levels of RSA. Our findings highlight the joint impact of biological, psychological, and social-environmental factors on Internet addiction and have important implications for the prevention of and intervention against emerging adults’ Internet addiction."

Voyer \nPurpose The development of self-service technologies, while intended to better serve customers by offering them autonomy, has created situations in which individuals may require additional help. The purpose of this paper is to explore perceptions of chat as an assistance channel, to identify its perceived role in a customer service environment. Design/methodology/approach In all, 23 semi-structured interviews held with both chat and non-chat users assessed perceptions of chat in an assistance encounter. A thematic analysis was used. Findings The findings highlight a paradoxical perception of chat in a customer assistance context. On the one hand, customers perceive live chat as mainly beneficial in a customer service context, alleviating embarrassment, perceived threats and potential dissatisfaction linked to assistance requests. On the other hand, the elusive nature of a chat conversation interlocutor (human or artificial) adversely affects how customers interpret assistance from companies. Research limitations/implications This research underscores the perceived threats of assistance encounters and shows the ambivalent role of chat in such a context. It also highlights chat’s specific features that make it a relevant medium for assistance requests. Practical implications This study helps companies better understand customers’ perceptions of assistance requests and chat in that context. Companies can use the findings to develop better ways to address assistance needs and offer transparent and fully personalized human chat to provide an inclusive service. Originality/value This paper highlights the ambivalent role of chat as an assistance channel, easing assistance requests but also entailing a potential negative spillover effect, when negative chat perceptions of an artificial interlocutor have consequences."

Donini \n Paolo Riccardo Brustio \n Anna Mulasso \n Eleonora Poggiogalle \n Gianluca Zia \n Luca C Feletti \n Susanna Del Signore \nAbstract Physical frailty represents a clinical condition among older adults leading to adverse health outcomes, such as autonomy loss. To evaluate physical frailty in older adults, adopting information and communication technologies (ICT) may be useful. ADAMO (Caretek S.r.l.) is a care-watch accelerometer that allows to measure mobility in a non-intrusive way (Magistro et al., 2018) providing wider information on individual general health (Mulasso et al., in press). The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between indoor mobility, physical frailty and autonomy in a sample of Italian older adults. Methods: Thirty-two volunteers (age 65–84 years; women 56.2%) participated in the study. All wore ADAMO care-watch continuously over a 7-day period. The number of steps indoor was the main endpoint. Fragmented daily mobility was estimated. Physical frailty and autonomy were measured using the Tilburg Frailty Indicator (physical components) and the Groningen Activity Restriction Scale, respectively. Results: Significant inverse correlations were observed between number of steps and autonomy, and number of steps and physical frailty. Conversely, a significant direct correlation was observed between physical frailty and autonomy. Additionally, mediation analysis demonstrated full mediation effect of physical frailty between the number of steps and autonomy. Our results imply that high indoor mobility per se can reduce physical frailty and consequently helps to maintain autonomy. Conclusions: Indoor mobility captured by ADAMO accelerometer may be an important indicator of physical frailty and autonomy. ADAMO may be used as a non-intrusive telemonitoring solution to capture relevant information on individual general health in aged people."

Manago \n Genavee Brown \n Kendall A. Lawley \n Glenn Anderson \nThe amount of time adolescents spend communicating via digital technologies such as smartphones has led to concerns that computer-mediated communication (CMC) is displacing face-to-face (FtF) interactions and disrupting social development. Although many studies have examined CMC in adolescents’ relationships with friends, few studies have examined the role of CMC in adolescents’ renegotiation of closeness and autonomy with parents. To examine this issue, we administered an online daily diary with 169 U.S. adolescents to estimate the time they spend in CMC and FtF interactions and the number of texts they exchange with friends and parents. On the last day of the survey, we asked adolescents about their emotional closeness to friends and parents and their balance of closeness and volition with parents. Overall, we found more evidence for social stimulation than displacement effects of CMC. Texts and CMC time with friends predicted friend closeness after accounting for FtF time with friends; texts with parents predicted parent closeness after accounting for FtF time with parents. We also found support for our hypothesis that CMC would be associated with greater adolescent volition. CMC time with parents predicted greater volitional dependence (volition plus closeness) whereas texts with friends predicted greater independent decision-making (volition plus distance). We discuss how communication technologies are integrated into U.S. adolescents’ relationships with friends and parents and how CMC can facilitate, rather than stifle, adolescents’ adjustment of autonomy-relatedness with parents and their construction of emotional closeness with friends.

Nieborg \nThe rise of contemporary platforms—from GAFAM in the West to the “three kingdoms” of the Chinese Internet—is reconfiguring the production, distribution, and monetization of cultural content in staggering and complex ways. Given the nature and extent of these transformations, how can we systematically examine the platformization of cultural production? In this introduction, we propose that a comprehensive understanding of this process is as much institutional (markets, governance, and infrastructures), as it is rooted in everyday cultural practices. It is in this vein that we present fourteen original articles that reveal how platformization involves key shifts in practices of labor, creativity, and citizenship. Diverse in their methodological approaches and topical foci, these contributions allow us to see how platformization is unfolding across cultural, geographic, and sectoral-industrial contexts. Despite their breadth and scope, these articles can be mapped along four thematic clusters: continuity and change; diversity and creativity; labor in an age of algorithmic systems; and power, autonomy, and citizenship."

This article departs from a leader-centric analysis and the liberal frame that still largely informs assessment of political action, to foreground “fun” as a salient aspect of right-wing mobilization. Building on ethnographic fieldwork among the Hindu nationalists in India, I argue that fun is a metapractice that shapes the interlinked practices of fact-checking, abuse, assembly, and aggression among online volunteers for the right-wing movement. Furthermore, fun remains crucial for an experience of absolute autonomy among online users in ideological battles. Providing the daily drip feed for exclusion, fun as a metapractice bears a formal similarity to objectivity in its performative effects of distance and deniability."

Earthy \n Erik Styhr Petersen \nAbstract To date, autonomous shipping appears to primarily have been about a technology push rather than considering and providing sociotechnical solutions including re-design of work, capturing knowledge and addressing human factors in modern shipping. Autonomous shipping is frequently claimed to reduce human error, whereas in reality, any issue connected to humans will arguably move with the people from ship to shore in that different people will make different mistakes; with possibly more severe consequences. Furthermore, autonomous shipping is likely to require changes to regulation and increased attention to cyber security and other IT human-centred quality factors if it is to succeed. What the HUMANE project is interested in is how (in certain scenarios) the human collaborates with, hands over to, or takes over from the technology/automation to achieve an overall safe state of the system. The aim is to map and investigate a potential gap between current human skills, training and education and an autonomous maritime future, and to provide insight to enable mitigating change. The main project method is expert workshops, performed in a focus group style. Four workshops are planned and to date (mid 2019), two have been performed. The topic of the first was technology, and the second was legal, class and insurance implications. For this paper, we have analysed the data relevant to future skills. Results show that not only is the skill set imagined to be needed very different from that of today, it also contains many contradictory elements and, occasionally, demands for abilities that humans do not possess, and are unlikely to evolve."

    "text": "Doc 1094 :  The Master’s Tools Will Never Dismantle The Master’s House: Kavanaugh’s Confirmation Hearing and The Perils of Progressive Punitivism \nhttps://repository.uchastings.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2759&context=faculty_scholarship\n Hadar Aviram \nOn October 3, 2018, more than 2,400 law professors signed a letter addressed to the U.S. Senate, titled The Senate Should Not Confirm Kavanaugh. In the letter, the signatories argued that Brett Kavanaugh’s demeanor and tone during his confirmation hearing demonstrated a lack of judicial temperament and evinced his unfitness for high judicial office.\nLike many of my colleagues, I was deeply discomfited by the hearings, which reduced fact-finding to a partisan context and echoed the cultural acceptability of disrespect of women’s bodily autonomy — an obviously infuriating state of affairs. And yet, the reaction to the hearings by Kavanaugh’s opponents left me wondering: What were we hoping to accomplish by mocking and reviling this man? By expecting him to apologize or take responsibility and then trumpeting the inadequacy of his response? Was this hearing, and our polarized reactions to it, making inroads for gender equality? Would this become a conversation starter, one that, as my progressive and feminist colleagues argued, would “spark a reckoning” with the system?\nThis essay argues that the strong sentiments against Kavanaugh, though understandable and keenly felt, might have been deployed in the wrong direction, and an example of a broader phenomenon that I refer to as progressive punitivism. Progressive punitivism is the reliance on weapons traditionally wielded by the conservative right — shaming, stigmatization, denial of rehabilitation, punitive approaches, and identity-driven divisions — in the service of social justice ideals. Progressive punitivism operates within the criminal justice system, in the context of holding violent police officers, hate criminals, sexual abusers, and lenient judges accountable for their actions, but it also operates throughout the realm of social media and public opinion, and these two realms often cross paths in complex ways.\nThe marshaling of much progressive energy in the direction of punishing powerful individuals for their misdeeds should be viewed with ambivalence. On one hand, the desire for accountability on the part of the powerful and socially advantaged is understandable; on the other, I am deeply skeptical as to the potential of progressive punitivism to effectuate change and bring about mutual understanding, let alone a reckoning. My concern is that the recurrence to punitive methods sows divisiveness and rancor, discredits efforts at rapprochement or apology at the outset and thus discourages them, and directs the movement’s energy in poisonous, and ultimately futile, directions. In short, I think that the effort to dismantle the master’s house of misogyny and racial domination with the master’s tools — a recurrence to punitivism, excoriation, and shaming — is doomed to fail.\nThis essay proceeds in four parts. In Part I I problematize the idea of the accused’s demeanor as evidence of guilt, remorse, or entitlement, arguing that we tend to overestimate our ability to deduce internal states of mind from people’s behavior and expressions. Part II assesses the potential (or lack thereof) of public performances of reckoning to produce a valuable expression of remorse, discussing the value of contingent apologies. Part III expands the framework to examine the way our politically fractured field responds to partisan efforts to excoriate culprits, arguing that “starting a national conversation” on the basis of excoriation and stigmatization is not a realistic expectation. In Part IV I situate the Kavanaugh incident in the overall context of progressive punitivism, offering an initial and generative sketch of the ideology and its mixed effects. The conclusion offers a modest proposal for a better way to start a bipartisan conversation about gender-based inequities and iniquities, as well as a future agenda for research on progressive punitivism in its other manifestations."

So does their ability to harvest fine-grained information about their users (and acquaintances). This data puts such platforms in a position where they can not only covertly influence our thoughts, moods and behaviour: they can do so in a way that is maximally effective given our respective traits, vulnerabilities etc. This paper argues that if we are to stand any chance of taming these platforms’ considerable manipulative potential, some conceptual spring-cleaning is needed.\nFirst, we need to stop confusing regulatory power and regulation. Whereas in mechanics or cybernetics there is no need to distinguish between the two -since there are no agents whose autonomy is infringed by regulation- when the concept of regulation is applied to human behaviour this distinction becomes crucial, and hinges upon the concept of authority. Since social media platforms do not - yet - claim authority, they do not regulate us: they have regulatory power over us. Our task is to regulate that power.\nTo succeed in the latter task, we also need to acknowledge that the type of influence exercised by social media platforms is not merely non-deliberative: it is also covert. While the former is often unproblematic from an ethical/legal perspective, the latter not only threatens our right to freedom of thought, it also compromises our commitment to moral equality."

Given the advances made in ICT services that have been widely used, elderlies need to be equipped with the knowledge in using the services. The lack of ICT usage among elderlies is because of the low motivation to use the ICT applications. This in turn could be due to the lack of intrinsic values associated with the use of ICT applications among elderlies. This study explores further the features of ICT services needed to support intrinsic values activities. Brainstorming sessions is conducted in this study where it involved six ICT experts in order to identify ICT services features to support intrinsic value activities. Intrinsic motivation features are significant features in ICT services to support intrinsic value activities for productive ageing. There are five intrinsic motivation features identified in this research, which are autonomy, competence, relatedness, altruism and curiosity. The ICT services to support intrinsic value activities model comprises of the ICT services characteristics that are transactive, community-based with online communication channels, and incorporated with intelligent agents."

Consideration of life space travel offers a window into environmental autonomy and complexity in late life. The gendered nature of time use and social networks have been primarily studied in younger age groups. Our sample included 437 older adults (mean age 83 for both men and women) living in a large Florida retirement community that offered no services. Mean age was 83 for both men and women. Fewer (37.6%) women than men (69.7%) were married and more men drove a car (83% vs 63%).Women reported poorer subjective health and had more IADL limitations. Compared to women, men were significantly more likely to travel long distances. Women’s weekly and monthly travel tended to be local, limited to their neighborhood. On average, respondents of both genders visited their families and friends out of town every month. Better health, current driving and volunteering were related to longer driving distances for both genders, but these advantages were no longer significant after controlling for demographic characteristics. Our findings underscore the complex relationships between gender and life space travel in late life. Even among elderly men and women of the same age better health and driving resources contribute to larger life space for elderly men."

Berkowsky \nAbstract Previous work focusing on the relationship between Internet use and quality of life among older adults (aged 65+) has found evidence of various positive impacts. This project expands upon this work by examining the relationship between Internet use and measures of psychological well-being (PWB) including autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relations with others, purpose in life, and self-acceptance. The analytic sample is derived from two waves of data (Time 1 = 2004, Time 2 = 2011) taken from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study and includes a sample of older adults aged~65 at Time 1 (N = 4943). Participants were separated into four categories: those who did not use the Internet at Time 1 or 2, those who used the Internet at Time 1 only, those who used the Internet at Time 2 only, and those who used the Internet at both Time 1 and 2. Regression analyses were performed with the Time 2 PWB measures as the outcomes and the Internet use categories as the primary predictors. Results indicate that while continuous Internet users typically reported higher PWB scores compared to non-users, those who stopped use between Time 1 and 2 also reported higher scores and those who started use between Time 1 and 2 reported lower scores. These results generally held when introducing Time 1 PWB measures as controls, suggesting changes in Internet use may affect PWB but not necessarily in the predicted directions. Additional control variables, potential explanations, and implications for future research are discussed."

H. Hui \n Anise M. S. Wu \n Nicolson Yat-Fan Siu \n Ming-Lun Chung \n Ngai Pun \nGiven the increasing popularity of online game playing, the negative impacts of game addiction on both adolescents and adults attracted our attention. Previous studies based on the self-determination theory have examined the effects of the three basic psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness on problematic video game playing among Chinese young adults. Yet, as more evidence emerged pointing to the possible relation between need dissatisfaction and higher vulnerability for ill-being and psychopathology, the present study aimed to incorporate the impacts of both satisfaction and dissatisfaction for autonomy, competence, and relatedness in explaining Internet gaming disorder (IGD), a condition that may in turn impede eudaimonic well-being as indicated by flourishing. In a self-administered online survey with a valid sample of 1200 Chinese young adults aged 18–24 years (mean age = 19.48 years), the prevalence of probable IGD (for those who reported five or more symptoms in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) symptom list for IGD) was 7.5%. Our results showed that relatedness dissatisfaction positively predicted IGD symptoms after controlling for other need satisfaction and dissatisfaction. Also, flourishing was found to be negatively predicted by IGD. Finally, IGD was found to mediate the effect of relatedness dissatisfaction on flourishing. Our findings suggested a risk factor of relatedness dissatisfaction in predicting IGD, thereby significantly predicting flourishing."

Gorman \n Nancy J. Cooke \n Nathan J. McNeese \nProject overview Teamwork can be defined as dynamic team interaction between two or more interdependent members to achieve a shared goal. Many studies have examined how coordination dynamics are associated with team effectiveness in the context of all-human teams (Gorman, Amazeen, & Cooke, 2010), and later, in human-autonomy teams (HAT)s (Demir, Likens, Cooke, Amazeen, & McNeese, 2018). HATs must have autonomous agents that act as effective teammates and help enable HATs to function as collaborative systems. Synergistic relationships among a system’s human and technological components provide the basis for emergent systems-level outcomes. Layered dynamics, a recent empirical modelling technique aimed at achieving this objective (Gorman et al., 2019), considers reorganization of the sociotechnical system across individual components and the overall system. The current study examined layered dynamics of HATs during automation and autonomy failures and addresses how members of HATs interact with each other and technological aspects of the system. Design and Method We utilized a simulated Remotely Piloted Aircrtaft System (RPAS) Synthetic Task Environment with three heteregeneous and interdepedent roles: (1) a navigator, who created a dynamic flight plan and provided waypoint related information; (2) a pilot, who used this information to monitor and adjust settings. The pilot also communicated with the photographer to negotiate settings and enable proper conditions to obtain a good photograph; and (3) a photographer, who monitored and adjusted the camera to take good target photos, and provided feedback to the team. This study utilized a Wizard of Oz paradigm, in which the navigator and photographer were instructed that the pilot was a synthetic agent. However, the pilot was a highly-trained experimenter, in a separate room, who simulated an autonomous agent using limited vocabulary. There were 22 teams, and two participants were randomly assigned to the navigator and photographer roles. This task was comprised of ten 40-minute missions, and teams needed to take as many good photos as possible while avoiding alarms and rule violations. The primary manipulation was the application of three degraded conditions: (1) automation failure - role-level display failures, (2) autonomy failure - autonomous agent’s abnormal behavior, and (3) malicious cyber-attacks - the hijaking of the RPAS, with the synthetic agent providing false, detrimental information. We symbolically represented RPAS using layered dynamics, and calculated entropy measures for each (Gorman et al., 2019): (1) communications: team members interacting within the chat system; (2) vehicle: states of the RPA, including airspeed/altitude, turns, fuel, battery, remaining film, and termperature level; and (3) controls: the interface controls between the RPA and the team members. To measure team performance, we used a time and coordination based metric for each target in each mission. Results and Discussion Our main findings were: 1) vehicle and communication entropy were higher than control entropy and were associated with better adaptation to both failures, and 2) control entropy had a negative association with initial status on team performance, while vehicle entropy had a positive association. These findings describe the tendency of low performing teams to anticipate targets poorly. This was due to a failure to interact with the technology in a timely manner. This lagged effect can be attributed to teams taking too long to interact with the technology. These findings shed light on how the layered dynamics approach can help understand team behavior under degraded conditions.

Little is known, however, about the psychological impacts of another new technology: mobile telecommunication. The results of an exploratory investigation into the use of cell phones by young inhabitants of Rio de Janeiro suggest that mobile telephony is also generating psychological changes. In addition, they indicate that such changes are consistent with the new subjective organization - fluid and ever-changing - described by several analysts of the present era. In the case of these youngsters, the most important changes detected are related to: their increased autonomy, freedom and privacy; the increased intimacy that characterizes many of their relationships; the emergence of new forms of interpersonal control; their increased sense of security and the feeling of never being alone."

When man and machine interact, co-exist, and intermingle, cyberspace comes to interpenetrate the real world fully. In this cyborg world, software retains its regulatory role, becoming a language of interaction with our extended cyborg selves. The mediation of our extended selves by closed software threatens individual autonomy. We define a notion of freedom for software that does justice to our conception of it as language, sketching the outlines of a social and political philosophy for a cyborg world. In a cyberspace underwritten by free software, political structures become contingent and flexible: the polity can choose to change the extent and character of its participation. The rejection of opaque power is an old anarchist ideal: free software, by making power transparent, carries the potential to place substantive restrictions on the regulatory power of cyborg government."

They acquire their digital literacy autonomously and are adept at using various Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools to enrich their daily leisure life. Although prior research has addressed such phenomenon and its relation to school learning, the focus was mostly on students’ adoption of ICT tools to facilitate their learning. This study takes a further step by relating students’ digital literacy to their school curriculum and using the pedagogy of negotiated learning to improve their learning autonomy. The proposed negotiated learning design is to scaffold students along the authenticity–generalizability continuum; from operation-oriented knowledge and experience of ICT tools to the theory and technique of tools development and operation. It is expected that, by relating the school learning to students’ digital literacy, the way of students’ autonomously acquiring their digital literacy outside school may help them develop autonomy in school learning. For validating the proposal, an experiment with 36 university students studying the engineering course of multimedia technology has been implemented and evaluated. The qualitative results showed that participants developed their autonomy to exercise their digital literacy to resolve the difficulties they faced during Web exploration and data collection for their school learning. The quantitative data also evidenced their improvement of learning autonomy. The findings and the way how the learning practice is designed and implemented should offer teachers a different perspective of connecting school learning with students’ digital literacy acquired outside schools. Moreover, under the trend of youngsters’ digital literacy development, the findings provide a positive perspective on students’ digital literacy."

Occasional criticisms of the practicability of traditional norms and calls for greater transparency, however, may suggest an emerging paradigm shift."

With the pervasiveness of the internet and the increased awareness of the importance of having technology in a classroom, both teachers and students all over the world are being provided with technological tools that will further accelerate their ability to acquire or teach a second or foreign language. Technology integration in the classroom has become an important aspect of successful teaching. It has triggered many researchers to investigate different aspects of such integration. In addition, it could be an effective teaching tool when used to engage all students in the learning process. The results of the study show that teachers have positive attitudes toward the use of technology, particularly computer. The focal point of the project was to promote students’ communicative competence and autonomy via the implementation of technological tools. This study aimed at investigating the perceptions of EFL teachers about the use of technology in their classes and factors affecting technology implementation in Iranian Language Institutes. Descriptive statistics and sample t-test were used to analyze the questionnaire data. Results obtained from both the quantitative and qualitative data revealed teachers’ perceptions about integrating technology in their classes, incentives for teachers who use technology, types of technology used, facilitating and inhibiting factors affecting technology implementation, and the different attitudes of male and female teachers toward using technology. According to the results, teachers had positive attitudes regarding the use of technology, in particular computer, in their classrooms."

Chambers \nHuman morality may be thought of as a negative feedback cotrol system in which moral rules are reference values, and moral disapproval, blame, and punishment are forms of negative feedback given for violations of the moral rules. In such a system, if moral agents held each other accountable, moral norms would be enforced effectively. However, even a properly functioning social negative feedback system could not explain acts in which individual agents uphold moral rules in the face of contrary social pressure. Dr. Frances Kelsey, who withheld FDA approval for thalidomide against intense social pressure, is an example of the degree of individual moral autonomy possible in a hostile environment. Such extreme moral autonomy is possible only if there is internal, psychological negative feedback, in addition to external, social feedback. Such a cybernetic model of morality and moral autonomy is consistent with certain aspects of classical ethical theories."

As from the 1990’s, as a consequence of the globalization process, this assertion is no longer restricted to the research function, but also includes the teaching function. Nowadays, the university should work to produce pluriversity knowledge, that is, contextual knowledge to the extent that the principle organizing its production is its possible application. As the knowledge is applied beyond the university walls, the initiative to formulate the problems one intends to solve and to determine criteria for their relevance is the result of sharing between researchers and users. In pluriversity knowledge production, unilaterality is replaced by interactivity, which has gained enormous power by the revolution in information and communication technologies. Technological development is considered one of the most important tools for internationalization and for the use of the web to strengthen distance education and build collaborative research networks. As a result of globalization, the university increasingly needs to find regional synergies and intensify networks so as to stimulate and expand existing forms of transnational cooperation and multiply them in the framework of bilateral or multilateral agreements, in line with principles of mutual benefit. In this sense, Latin American Nursing has made efforts to transnationalize teaching and research institutions and establish regional collaborative networks. Initiatives in this sense include welcoming foreign students, mainly in graduate programs; international associations involving consulting services to foreign universities; collaborative research projects, distance education, virtual learning, faculty mobility, on-line libraries, research funding for students and faculty, among others. Some regional actions are just beginning, such as student exchange at undergraduate level and curriculum adaptations, while others are flourishing, such as the Collaborative Networks coordinated by the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (nursing in patient safety, mental health nursing, child health nursing, nursing researchers and HIV, care management, nurse migration, nurses in elderly health, nursing journal editors etc.); the offering of distance education, such as the courses offered to health professionals from Latin American countries with a view to skills development in drugs abuse control and the Electronic journal portal in the Virtual Health Library-Nursing, currently joining 18 Nursing journals published in Brazil, Colombia, Chile and Spain. Thus, transnational research centers need to be created, addressing themes and problems of specific interest to this region, and the dissemination of their research results needs to expand. In this context, the Latin American Journal of Nursing invites researchers from Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Dominican Republic, Uruguay and Venezuela to submit manuscripts about regional problems, with a view to encouraging new regional partnerships and contributing to the transnationalization of Nursing knowledge dissemination in Latin American nursing."

The target population of this study is students of K cyber university and a total of 254 cases are used for the analysis. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis is applied to verify 6 factors of DELES and structural equation analysis is applied to examine the relationship between distance education learning environment and learning achievement and distance education satisfaction. The study result shows that DELES is composed of six factors such as instructor support, student interaction & collaboration, personal relevance, authentic learning, active learning and student autonomy and its model fits are appropriate. The result of structural equation analysis shows distance education learning environment significantly influences distance education satisfaction directly as well as indirectly mediated by learning achievement. Learning achievement also significantly influences distance education satisfaction. Conclusions and implications are followed."

The state’s loss of power and autonomy to regulate economic and social activity, as well as to protect individual rights, has been accentuated in the European Community (EC) as a result of a process that to a certain degree anticipated contemporary global tendencies. The EC appears, therefore, as a privileged observatory of the possible impact of globalization on the contents of rights, whether ‘classical’ rights or new rights, such as the rights of access to information, new forms of in…"

The benefits of multiple modalities, online support tools, and instant feedback are believed to have the potential of increasing learner control, motivation, and autonomy. However, a closer look at what is actually available on the market, in this instance the sub-market of Business English multimedia programmes, reveals that many such learning tools fall short of the claims that have been made for them, at least in the eyes of pedagogues. As teachers and students do not always see eye-to-eye as far as the usefulness of particular learning tools and activities is concerned, it seems paramount to let the final user and ultimate target group have their say, as well.

Based on activity theory, the purpose of this research is to investigate learners’ attitude factors toward e-learning systems. A total 168 participants were asked to answer a questionnaire. After factor analysis, learners’ attitudes can be grouped four different factors - e-learning as a learner autonomy environment, e-learning as a problem-solving environment, e-learning as a multimedia learning environment, and teachers as assisted tutors in e-learning. In addition, this research approves that activity theory is an appropriate theory for understanding e-learning systems. Furthermore, this study also provides evidence that e-learning as a problem-solving environment can be positively influenced by three other factors."

The class used a hybrid model (in class and online) that both integrated and strongly encouraged blogging on a community style, open source blog. The curriculum was designed to both create a more distributed educational structure and to develop greater autonomy and participation in student activity. It was hypothesized that as students engaged in increasingly complex Internet activities they would develop greater strength in Internet self-efficacy in organization and differentiation of information and reaction to and generation of information. 367 undergraduate students participated in the current study. A pre-, post-test format was used to measure whether there were significant changes in strength of Internet self-efficacy, with the inclusion of a control group of a more traditionally-structured class. The results showed that a blogcentric course has impacts on the increases in students’ Internet self-efficacy, particularly for reactive/generative self-efficacy. The findings are discussed in light of potential implications on the future direction of education."

In the 21st century – with legal news, television trials, reality police shows, YouTube execution videos (etc.) shouting at us from our many screens – Plato might think his theatrocratic nightmare had come true with a vengeance. In our theatrocracy, where the media and its ever-online TV spectators can determine guilt or innocence, are the boundaries of the legal system beginning to dissolve? Does theatrocracy threaten law’s “stability,” “legitimacy,” “autonomy,” and “authority,” as some have argued? Is theatrocracy a threat to nomocracy, to the very existence of law? “Theatrocracy Unwired” looks at the nature of our legal theatrocracy (from the age of television to the age of the Internet), theoretical discussions of law and m…"

Existing research on the effects of ICTs for knowledge workers has illustrated the ways they can lead to practices of overwork and work–life spillover. However, the dearth of studies on service workers and ICT means that we have a limited understanding of their role across different segments of the workforce. Drawing on interviews with service workers and knowledge workers, I examine how they use ICTs to shape their experiences of work. The study finds the two groups deployed ICTs in different ways, and employed different ICT-centric strategies to control the temporal and emotional demands of their labor. The service workers deployed strategies of everyday resistance in concert with their ICTs to gain a feeling of autonomy within the power structures of their workplaces. The knowledge workers deployed strategies of inaccessibility …"

This article aims to find out if consumer power has increased as a result of comparison websites and access to more information, or whether it has decreased because of unreliable companies and websites that misuse identity concealing features of the Internet. Main question is whether the autonomy of consumers, and therewith the position of power against producers, is restricted by advertisement techniques from producers who are using the Internet, and if there are causes for concern. Attention will be paid to current legislation on consumer protection and on unfair commercial practices, and implications of online shopping are discussed. Methods such as ‘markufacturing’ and comparison websites are discussed explicitly. Some focus points are provided as a first onset to further regulation in order to retain fair power positions between producers and consumers."

Project work claims to anticipate initiation into autonomy and reflects new power relations between professionals and clients as well. It is assumed that project work illustrates the transition from traditional school forms to a more individualized society where Information and Communication Technologies media (ICT) are increasingly integrated in learning.

Also, we tested the moderating effect of the structural autonomy in network, the extent to which a user feels that ties of relationship can be managed in terms of holding important hubs in social network. The data were collected through online survey from 320 members of four online communities of two popular SNS, Facebook and KakaoStory. The findings show that first of all, three out of four constructs we studied as a structural characteristic, cohesiveness, multiplexity, and syncopated complexity had positive impact on relational inertia, and also relational inertia was positively associated with the decrease of information sharing on SNS. Second, the users’ structural autonomy on SNS made the decrease of information sharing weaker and also moderated the relationship between relational inertia and decrease of information sharing. This study suggests that even SNS, which enables the relationship building and information sharing through social networking, could bring negative effect depending on the structural characteristics of a user’s social network. In this study, we also confirmed the value of structural autonomy on SNS. Actors can benefit from being linked to only the important ties on social network to obtain effective information and social capital from relationships."

Despite this, the voices and experiences of emerging adults are largely missing from literature on family consumption. Emerging adult families typically combine digital natives and digital immigrants, but little is known about how their interactions around digital communications technology relate to emerging adult preoccupations with affiliation and autonomy. This interpretive study explores how emerging adults’ smartphones are bound up with a complex network of family communication and consumption practices, often across household, geographic and generational boundaries. Affiliation and autonomy emerged as intertwined rather than competing dimensions of participants’ smartphone use, contributing to the distribution and development of family as the nest empties."

Mediation practices have been strengthening their conceptual and empirical grounding for the following reasons: an increased recognition of their social and educational potential, and as a result of the high level of fragility regarding the stability, convenience, and social cohesion of current society. Mediation, as a qualification and empowerment of individuals, is centred on people, social groups, and communication skills for coping with multiple problems. Mediation is, therefore, recognised as a potential practice that increases the development of a desire in individuals and groups to construct the dynamics of non-violent and participatory interactions.

Supposedly justified by an appeal to security threats, fraud and abuse, citizens are screened, located, detected and their data stored, aggregated and analysed. At the same time potential customers are profiled to detect their habits and preferences in order to provide for targeted services. Both industry and the European Commission are investing huge sums of money into what they call Ambient Intelligence and the creation of an ‘Internet of Things’. Such intelligent networked environments will entirely depend on real time monitoring and real time profiling, resulting in real time adaptation of the environment. In this contribution the author will assess the threats and opportunities of such autonomic profiling in terms of its impact on individual autonomy and refined discrimination and indicate the extent to which traditional data protection is effective as regards profiling."

    "text": "Doc 124 :  Facilitating the Development of the Autonomous Language Learner Using Online Virtual Learning Environments \nhttps://doi.org/10.4304/tpls.3.4.572-580\n Mark Brooke \nThis paper argues that if used correctly, computer-mediated courseware (CMC), in the form of an online Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) such as Blackboard or Moodle, has the potential to offer adult learners in university settings an optimal autonomy-supportive environment for learning English as a second language at a distance. The paper firstly considers how to promote learner autonomy through offering participants choices during the initial stages of a course through a negotiated syllabus. It then divides the language learning process into metacognitive and cognitive linguistic capacities and provides examples of strategies to increase autonomy in these spheres. Autonomy with regard to metacognitive linguistic capacities can be developed first by the multimodal aspect of CMC, in particular, the unprecedented access to resources, second, through the array of mediums to select in the creation and submission of assignments and third, through the notion of ‘dissemination’ (Mayes, 2002), which allows for ‘vicarious learning’ (Bandura, 1986). Autonomy with regard to cognitive linguistic capacities can be promoted through goal-oriented participant interaction on spoken and written forums on the platform, followed by consciousness-raising language activities guiding students to notice patterns in the language. In conclusion, it is suggested that a VLE might lead to optimum learning through the facilitation of a state of ‘flow’ or ‘autotelic’ activity, a concept closely related to autonomy and intrinsic motivation."

Clowes \nIf we are flexible, hybrid and unfinished creatures that tend to incorporate or at least employ technological artefacts in our cognitive lives, then the sort of technological regime we live under should shape the kinds of minds we possess and the sorts of beings we are. E-Memory consists in digital systems and services we use to record, store and access digital memory traces to augment, re-use or replace organismic systems of memory. I consider the various advantages of extended and embedded approaches to cognition in making sense of E-Memory and some of the problems that debate can engender. I also explore how the different approaches imply different answers to questions such as: does our use of internet technology imply the diminishment of ourselves and our cognitive abilities? Whether or not our technologies can become actual parts of our minds, they may still influence our cognitive profile. I suggest E-Memory systems have four factors: totality, practical cognitive incorporability, autonomy and entanglement which conjointly have a novel incorporation profile and hence afford some novel cognitive possibilities. I find that thanks to the properties of totality and incorporability we can expect an increasing reliance on E-Memory. Yet the potentially highly entangled and autonomous nature of these technologie pose questions about whether they should really be counted as proper parts of our minds."

Fischer \nThis article presents a survey of computer-based tracking in CALL and the uses to which the analysis of tracking data can be put to address questions in CALL in particular and second language acquisition (SLA) in general. Adopting both quantitative and qualitative methods, researchers have found that students often use software in unexpected ways, a finding which has consequences for the notion of learner autonomy and underscores the need for learner training. In addition, researchers, especially those in computer-mediated communication (CMC), have demonstrated the operation of fundamental SLA principles and also extended our understanding of those principles. Finally, comparison of students’ actual use of software and their self-reported use of software reveals the danger of over reliance on self-report data. Although logistically challenging and potentially time-consuming, analysis of tracking data goes a long way in putting CALL on solid empirical footing."

However, patient preferences for participation in health care vary greatly. Promoting patient-centered health care requires an understanding of the relationship between Internet use and a broader range of preferences for participation than previously measured.To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients’ overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions.The Health Information Wants Questionnaire (HIWQ) was administered to gather data about patients’ preferences for the (1) amount of information desired about different aspects of a health condition, and (2) level of decision-making autonomy desired across those same aspects.The study sample included 438 individuals: 226 undergraduates (mean age 20; SD 2.15) and 212 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 72; SD 9.00). A significant difference was found between the younger and older age groups’ Internet use frequencies, with the younger age group having significantly more frequent Internet use than the older age group (younger age group mean 5.98, SD 0.33; older age group mean 3.50, SD 2.00; t436=17.42, P<.01). Internet use frequency was positively related to the overall preference rating (γ=.15, P<.05), suggesting that frequent Internet users preferred significantly more information and decision making than infrequent Internet users. The relationships between Internet use frequency and different types of preferences varied: compared with infrequent Internet users, frequent Internet users preferred more information but less decision making for diagnosis (γ=.57, P<.01); more information and more decision-making autonomy for laboratory test (γ=.15, P<.05), complementary and alternative medicine (γ=.32, P<.01), and self-care (γ=.15, P<.05); and less information but more decision-making autonomy for the psychosocial (γ=-.51, P<.01) and health care provider (γ=-.27, P<.05) aspects. No significant difference was found between frequent and infrequent Internet users in their preferences for treatment information and decision making.Internet use frequency has a positive relationship with the overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, but its relationship with different types of preferences varies. These findings have important implications for medical practice."

This article argues that absolutist positions based on the embryo’s right to life or the woman’s right to choose fail to represent the reality of abortion and the dilemmas it poses. It suggests an approach in which maternal consciousness and foetal development are together recognized as intrinsic to the process of humanization, and argues for a gradual shift in emphasis from the primacy of the woman’s right to choose in the first trimester, to the right to life of the foetus in the third semester. It concludes with a reflection on Mary and Eve, as symbols of women’s eschatological hope and existential reality with regard to childbearing."

But such newsrooms did not exist when newspapers first emerged. This paper describes, based primarily on the evidence of building structure and architectural floor plans, when and why special newsrooms were created in Germany and how they developed. At first these rooms were small, and journalists often resided there too. From the late nineteenth century editorial offices became differentiated and, in the German case typically became separate rooms reflecting newspapers’ different editorial subjects and sections, thereby fostering their journalistic autonomy. Only recently can changes towards alternative structures and open-plan offices be observed. Meanwhile the production of internet news returns to an organization that does not require a newsroom. This paper argues that newsroom structure has influenced journalism in Germany, which did not change its production routines much after World War II when the American journal…"

The full potential of Internet resources, even authentic information resources, has largely remained unused for language learning and teaching. Organisational and affective factors have discouraged many teachers from using the Internet for language teaching. The Internet-enhanced object-oriented multiple-user domain(MOO) can serve as a tool to select and enhance Internet resources, while at the same time expanding the possibilities of the traditional classroom. Its text-based, synchronous and asynchronous communications resources are integrated within a common interface. Its support mechanisms are good for language teachers, who are only too often left alone with the new technology. The author argues for an intricate interdependence of pedagogy and technology, and sees teacher autonomy and the MOO as a promising combination for language teaching …"

Moving from a macro to micro point-of-view, we noticed three components in our framework that were very relevant to course instructors and classroom tutors namely needs, design and learner autonomy - as they move their teaching from real life to the virtual universe. More interestingly, we also noticed that these three components are not just relevant to language instructors but they are relevant to all educators who wish to embrace e-learning wholeheartedly. On the downside, given that many educational institutions (in Malaysia at least) are not yet ready for e-learning or are just beginning to develop an e-learning infrastructure without clear directions, very few Malaysian academics can be seen as “true” e-learning developers and/or instructors. To collect empirical data on this critical phenomenon, we identified and personally approached two highly experienced Malaysian academics who have attempted to embrace e-learning as part of their academic existence. This research paper shares their personal drive, feelings, failures and successes given the fact that both of them had chosen to work outside of the system as it were - to prove to their peers the virtues of e-driven learning and to show others that e- learning is the path to the future. Using excerpts from unstructured narrative interviews and snippets of informal online communication with our two participants, we found that although they come from different academic backgrounds, they somehow shared common goals and faced nearly the same challenges and difficulties in their ongoing efforts to encourage, promote and support e-learning deployment."

Increasingly, applications for marketing and advertising have been articulated as a means to enhance the consumer shopping experience, in addition to improving efficiency. However, privacy advocates have challenged the mass aggregation of personally-identifiable information in databases and geotracking, the use of location-based services to identify one’s precise location over time. This paper employs the framework of contextual integrity related to privacy developed by Nissenbaum (Privacy in context: technology, policy, and the integrity of social life. Stanford University Press, Stanford, 2010) as a tool to understand citizen response to implementation IoT-related technology in the supermarket. The purpose of the study was to identify and understand specific changes in information practices brought about by the IoT that may be perceived as privacy violations. Citizens were interviewed, read a scenario of near-term IoT implementation, and were asked to reflect on changes in the key actors involved, information attributes, and principles of transmission. Areas where new practices may occur with the IoT were then highlighted as potential problems (privacy violations). Issues identified included the mining of medical data, invasive targeted advertising, and loss of autonomy through marketing profiles or personal affect monitoring. While there were numerous aspects deemed desirable by the participants, some developments appeared to tip the balance between consumer benefit and corporate gain. This surveillance power creates an imbalance between the consumer and the corporation that may also impact individual autonomy. The ethical dimensions of this problem are discussed."

Indeed, the possibility of interconnecting users and resources of different social networks enables a lot of strategic applications whose main strength is the integration of different communities that nevertheless preserves their diversity and autonomy. In this new scenario, the role of Social Network Analysis is crucial in studying the evolution of structures, individuals, interactions, and so on, and in extracting powerful knowledge from them. But the preliminary step to do is designing a good way to crawl the underlying graph. Although this aspect has been deeply investigated in the field of social networks, it is an open issue when moving towards SISs. Indeed, we cannot expect that a crawling strategy, specifically designed for social networks, is still valid in a Social Internetworking Scenario, due to its specific topological features. In this paper, we confirm the above claim, giving a strong motivation for our second contribution, which is the definition of a new crawling strategy. This strategy, specifically conceived for SISs, is shown to fully overcome the drawbacks of the state-of-the-art crawling strategies."

Göritz \nSubsumed under the umbrella of User Experience (UX), practitioners and academics of Human-Computer Interaction look for ways to broaden their understanding of what constitutes ‘’pleasurable experiences’’ with technology. The present study considered the fulfilment of universal psychological needs, such as competence, relatedness, popularity, stimulation, meaning, security, or autonomy, to be the major source of positive experience with interactive technologies. To explore this, we collected over 500 positive experiences with interactive products (e.g., mobile phones, computers). As expected, we found a clear relationship between need fulfilment and positive affect, with stimulation, relatedness, competence and popularity being especially salient needs. Experiences could be further categorized by the primary need they fulfil, with apparent qualitative differences among some of the categories in terms of the emotions involved. Need fulfilment was clearly linked to hedonic quality perceptions, but not as strongly to pragmatic quality (i.e., perceived usability), which supports the notion of hedonic quality as ‘’motivator’’ and pragmatic quality as ‘’hygiene factor.’’ Whether hedonic quality ratings reflected need fulfilment depended on the belief that the product was responsible for the experience (i.e., attribution)."

The paper presents the results of a study which aimed to determine the effect of the application of Internet resources on the development of learner autonomy as well as the impact of greater learner independence on attainment in English as a foreign language. The participants were 46 Polish senior high school students divided into the experimental group (N = 28) and the control (N = 18) group. The students in the experimental group were subjected to innovative instruction with the use of the Internet and the learners in the control group were taught in a traditional way with the help of the coursebook. The data were obtained by means questionnaires, interviews, learners’ logs, an Internet forum, observations as well as language tests, and they were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. The results show that the experimental students manifested greater independence after the intervention and they also outperformed the controls on language tests."

Information and communication technologies can facilitate this by enabling employees to attend to various personal life matters during the workday. Critical to utilising such flexibility is a degree of autonomy over how work time can be used. However, in organisational settings, such autonomy is tempered by structural and normative constraints. This article examines how environments of constrained autonomy affect employees’ ability to use time flexibly. Case study data of engineers and managers working in the telecommunications industry is presented. This reveals two findings. Firstly, environments of constrained autonomy limit when during the workday employees can engage in personal mediated communications. Secondly, when personal time is inserted into such contexts, the quantitative and qualitative character of this time is affected."

Sastrón-Báguena \nCoupling shop floor software system (SFS) with the set of production equipment (SPE) becomes a complex task. Itinvolves open and proprietary standards, information and communication technologies among other tools andtechniques. Due to market turbulence, either custom solutions or standards based solutions eventually require aconsiderable effort of adaptation. Loose coupling concept has been identified in the organizational design communityas a compensator for organization survival. Its presence reduces organization reaction to environment changes. Inthis paper the results obtained by the organizational design community are identified, translated and organized tosupport the SFS-SPE integration problem solution. A classical loose coupling model developed by organizationalstudies community is abstracted and translated to the area of interest. Key aspects are identified to be used aspromoters of SFS-SPE loose coupling and presented in a form of a reference scheme. Furthermore, this referencescheme is proposed here as a basis for the design and implementation of a generic coupling solution or couplingframework, that is included as a loose coupling stage between SFS and SPE. A validation example with various setsof manufacturing equipment, using different physical communication media, controller commands, programminglanguages and wire protocols is presented, showing an acceptable level of autonomy gained by the SFS."

Akinwamide \n O. G. Adedara \nThe digitalization of academic interactions and collaborations in this present technologically conscious world is making collaborations between technology and pedagogy in the teaching and learning processes to display logical and systematic reasoning rather than the usual stereotyped informed decisions. This simply means, pedagogically, learning is being revolutionized with visible transformation from quantity to higher quality. Through independent, self-paced learning; students interact with technologies to review, construct, analyze, and make submissions. It is to be noted that the inclusion of information and communication technology (ICT) into Language education gives vent to new learning paradigms in language education and this in a way concomitantly redefines the role of the teacher as well as repositions the cognition level of the learners. This paper therefore intents to beam searchlight on possible strategy for achieving autonomy in second language learning through digitalization. It is to be noted that the challenges of second language learners may not be resolved totally in the language classroom, hence there is the need for the teacher to become a facilitator thereby paving way for students’ self- discovery through different cyber-tasks and navigating system inherent in this computer infested world. This paper therefore displays a phase of digitalized pedagogy in the language classroom."

A Self-Determination Perspective \nhttps://doi.org/10.1177/0894439314525116\n Xuequn Wang \nPeople increasingly rely on social network sites (SNSs) to find out timely information about crises. Thus, emergency managers are interested in how people participate and how to promote their participation in SNSs after crises. Based on self-determination theory, this study develops a theoretical model to examine the mechanisms through which different types of motivation contribute to various participating behaviors in SNSs after crises. Survey data were collected after the Ya’an earthquake, which occurred in China on April 20, 2013. Our results show that while autonomous motivation is positively related to posting new content about the earthquake, controlled motivation is positively related to commenting on others’ content about the earthquake. Furthermore, perceived autonomy and perceived relatedness are positively related to autonomous motivation. We suggest that emergency managers may want to promote different types of motivations, depending on the specific participating behavior preferred after crises."

Gill \nIn the very interdisciplinary tradition of AI & Society, this issue covers a diversity of topics ranging from mindloading, ‘moral subject’ and human dignity and autonomy, organisation as a cognitive machine, the dilemma of boundaries between femininity and masculinity in the cyberspace, knowledge sharing for sustainable development, the emerging robotisation of the organisation, to cultural acceptance of robots in richly complex regions of the world. Other issues covered in this issue include dialogical framework of skill training, wealth adjustment in an artificial society and speech recognition. On mind-uploading, the argument is that ‘mind-uploading is a futuristic process that involves scanning brains and recording relevant information which is then transferred into a computer’, in the sense of ‘transfers of both human minds and identities from biological brains into computers’. The world of ubiquitous technology brings about a new challenge of what is to be human, for example, what we understand by ‘moral subject’, in other words the subject’s unique metaphysical qualities of dignity and autonomy. The argument posited in this issue is that concept of ‘human dignity underlies the foundation of many democratic systems, particularly in Europe as well as of international treaties, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Digital agents, artificial organisms as well as new capabilities of the human agents related to their embeddedness in digital and biotechnological environments bring about an important transformation of the human self appraisal’, especially from an ethical perspective. It is interesting to note how technological culture is beginning to subscribe to the transformation of the human organisation into a cognitive machine. In the human-centred tradition of AI & Society, it can be seen as a transformation of the human dimension from wisdom to calculation and then to being a cognitive machine. The argument put forward in this issue is that ‘cognitive machines contribute to improving cognitive abilities in the organisation by extending people’s rationally and decisionmaking capacity, and by reducing intra-individual and group dysfunctional conflict’. The increasing acceptance of the organisation in terms of a cognitive machine leads to robotisation of the organisation, raising issues of the cultural acceptance of the cognitive machine in diverse cultural regions of the world. As we live in a culture of ubiquitous technology where ‘everything can be commodified, measured and calculated and can be put in the competitive market for sale, detached from its roots and purpose’, we face a dilemma and challenge of what is meant to be human. The world of cyberspace poses a further dilemma as to where the boundaries may lie ‘between femininity and masculinity both in terms of lifestyle and thought style’. The issue could be posed as how to ‘redefine our humanness in terms of the changing nature of science, technology and their deeper impact on human life’. This means also to take note how ‘on the one hand our being in the cyberspace opens up new and exciting horizons before us, on the other hand how we ourselves are changed and transformed in the process’. This reorientation of the human dimension also raises issues of how societies use symbols and signs to communicate information in the technological world we live in, and in what ways the communication media conveys a broad range of different kinds of messages within diverse cultural contexts. In the globalising world, knowledge sharing is increasingly seen as a crucial factor in cultivating sustainable K. S.

Clowes \nThis article examines the articulation of sibiriak identity in the early 21st century. This time is particularly important because the current Russian government has made a point of curtailing the regional autonomy of the Yeltsin years. Drawing on regional news sources, Internet blogs, and writings by prominent Siberian public intellectuals, this article delineates a number of specifically Siberian voices and the concerns they discuss in the public sphere. It argues that contemporary Siberian identity differs significantly from stereotypical European Russian constructions of Siberian identity that equate simple goodness and honesty with the broad Siberian terrain. This material shows a diverse range of opinions and attitudes, a concerted effort to keep the Siberian heritage before the public eye, and a sustained discussion about the usable past. Focusing particularly on Evgenii Grishkovets’s autobiographical novella, Rivers (Reki, 2005), this article examines the emergence of a post-Soviet discourse that reaches beyond Siberian stereotypes and openly expresses social and cultural problems encountered by Siberians."

The primary aim of the project was to promote the autonomous practice of literacy in L2, while reflecting upon the linguistic codes and pragmatics of L1 and L2 through the correction of errors. Alongside previous work ( Appel, 1999 , Appel and Mullen, 2000 & 2002; Appel and Gilabert, 2002 , Braun, 2006 , Munoz Vicente, 2013 , Schenker, 2012 , Ushioda, 2000 ), the present study is based on the axiomatic principles of autonomy and reciprocity in order to detect weak points in the project. The varying levels of motivation within the tandem pairs and an insufficient command of the native language are identified as the main pitfalls."

Despite reliance on the usual stultifying stereotypes produced by marketeers to promote mobile phones, we explore the possibility that increased access to public space generates for adolescent girls alternative choices of leisure experiences and possibilities of multiple enriching identities. The findings suggest that mobile phone use can impart a sense of self‐confidence, sexuality and autonomy which defies the male gaze in public spaces and may allow adolescent women to reject traditional images of femininity at a formative stage in the life course and take steps to a further array of leisure choices. It may only be a temporary image that assists a sense of self at a vulnerable time in life, or it may infiltrate other aspects of subjectivity and assist an ongoing sense of self‐confidence.

We posit that higher workplace status is associated with significant incentives and greater opportunities for personal Internet use. We test this hypothesis using data collected via a recent national telephone survey (n = 1,024). Regression analyses demonstrate that, contrary to conventional wisdom, higher-status employees, as measured by occupation status, job autonomy, income, education, and gender, engage in significantly more frequent personal Internet use at work."

Some point to the empowering effects of online discussion and fund-raising on recent electoral campaigns in the United States to argue that the Internet will restore the public sphere. Others claim that the Internet is just a virtual mall, a final extension of capitalist rationalization into every corner of our lives, a trend supported by an ever denser web of surveillance technologies threatening individual autonomy in the advanced societies of the West. This introduction to the special section on critical theory of communication technology argues for the democratic thesis with some qualifications. The most important contribution of new technology to democracy is not necessarily its effects on the conventional political process but rather its ability to assemble a public around technical networks that enroll individuals scattered over wide geographical areas. Communities of medical patients, video game players, musical performers, and many other groups have emerged on the Internet with surprising consequences. New forms of resistance correlate with the rationalizing tendencies of a technologized society."

The power and alternative to control over self-representation on social networking Web sites brings certain autonomy to an individual and, as a result, has an impact on the style of the exchange. Some of the specific objectives of the study are to study the emerging style of socio-technical exchange and to identify the characteristics of an emerging socio-technical society. This study found that social identity, social exchange, and social vicinity are the key characteristics of the emerging socio-technical exchange. A gradual paradigm shift from traditional societies to knowledge-based societies was observed. While, on one hand, a high dependency and usage of social networking Web sites was observed, on the other hand, the level of trust and dependency between the community members was found to be diminishing."

Since the rise of Cybernetics in the middle of the last century ideas from information theory and control theory have been applied to the adaptations of biological organisms in order to explain how they work. This does not, however, explain functionality, which is widely but not universally attributed to biological systems. There are two approaches to functionality, one based on etiology (what a trait was selected for), and the other based in autonomy. I argue that the etiological approach, as understood in terms of control theory, suffers from a problem of symmetry, by which function can equally well be placed in the environment as in the organism. Focusing on the autonomy view, I note that it can be understood to some degree in terms of control theory in its version called second order cybernetics. I present an approach to second order cybernetics that seems plausible for organisms with limited computational power, due to Hooker, Penfold and Evans. They hold that this approach gives something like concepts, certainly abstractions from specific situations, a trait required for functionality in its system adaptive form (i.e., control of the system by itself). Using this cue, I argue that biosemiotics provides the methodology to incorporate these quasi concepts into an account of functionality."

There is, however, a measure of stigma associated with use of these chat rooms, particularly by men who are older or in coupled relationships. Using these data, the paper argues that M4M chat rooms play a vital role in fostering the sexual autonomy of many men who frequent these venues and that sociologists should devote more study to the complexity of online social interaction."

How HBIBs operate can be captured in the acronym SMILES: Speed, Multiple income, Inexpensive, LEan, and Smart. They are founded (amongst other motives) for reasons of autonomy, freedom and independence. Both aspects – the how and why – of HBIBs are conducive to the creation of variety as they facilitate trial‐and‐error commercialisation of authentic ideas.Research limitations/implications – Five theoretical perspectives posit that variety is important for the indus…"

It finds that contrary to reports of US parents who fear that mobile phone rules and restrictions undermine intimacy, refugee families may view restriction as an expression of intimacy because it is related to cultural expectations. Moreover, the article points out that whereas mobile communication almost always provides access to autonomy among white middle class families, these media only sometimes provide access to autonomy among refugee families."

Described below is a project that introduced students to how technology and the Internet can empower the independent language learner. The goal was for the students to develop knowledge of and confidence in self-instruction and learn how to use technology and the Internet to further their language education independently. This article first outlines research into autonomous language learning with computers, offers a list of key elements for autonomous language learning, gives a description of how an independent language learning project was implemented and reports on results of student surveys that measured student response to the project. These students lacked the skills, knowledge and confidence to study on their own. However, by learning autonomous language learning concepts, and with instruction on how technology and the Internet can support a digital language learner, they gained the understanding and confidence to set and accomplish language learning goals on their own."

Empirical data related to the difficulties that customers have when they deal with the bank through internet technology and electronic banking. The authors discuss the difficulties that customers expressed from an ethical standpoint. Design/methodology/approach The key problem of the paper is “how does research handle the user’s lack of competence in a web‐based commercial environment?” The authors illustrate this ethical dilemma with data from a Danish Bank collected in 2002. The data have been structured by an advanced text analytic method, Pertex (by generation of intentionality of verbal actors from text). Findings The authors can conclude that the experience of lack of competency in internet banking implies a severe damage on the experience of the ethics of the good life and of the respect for the basic ethical principles of customer autonomy, dignity, integrity and vulnerability. However, increased experience of competency may imply experience of increased feeling of ethical superiority and of the good life among customers. Research limitations/implications The important implication for managerial research of this study would be for banks to focus on customer competency with an ethical concern instead of only being concerned with technical solutions for effective internet operations. Practical implications Since more and more businesses are digitally based, the authors can foresee a potential generic problem of lack of competence for certain age groups and also of people from different social groups. Originality/value The paper provides an analysis of the ethics of on‐line banking on the basis of Pertex methodology and with the use of basic ethical principles of autonomy, dignity, integrity and vulnerability."

I argue that following the Kantian criticism of Aristotelian metaphysics, contemporary biotechnology and information and communication technologies bring about a new challenge—this time, with regard to the Kantian moral subject understood in the subject’s unique metaphysical qualities of dignity and autonomy. The concept of human dignity underlies the foundation of many democratic systems, particularly in Europe as well as of international treaties, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Digital agents, artificial organisms as well as new capabilities of the human agents related to their embeddedness in digital and biotechnological environments bring about an important transformation of the human self-appraisal. A critical comparative reflection of this transformation is important because of its ethical implications. I deal first with the concept of agent within the framework of Aristotelian philosophy, which is the basis for further theories in accordance with and/or in opposition to it, particularly since modernity. In the second part of this paper, I deal with the concept of personhood in Kantian philosophy, which supersedes the Aristotelian metaphysics of substance and builds the basis of a metaphysics of the moral human subject. In the third part, I discuss the question of artificial agents arising from modern biology and ICT. Blurring the difference between the human and the natural and/or artificial opens a “new space” for philosophical reflection as well as for debate in law and practical policy."

Recently, Iris Marion Young has argued that it is not possible to analyse oppression as a unitary moral category. Rather, the term ‘oppression’ refers to several distinct structures, namely, exploitation, marginalisation, powerlessness, cultural imperialism, and violence. This paper rejects Young’s claim and advances a general theory of oppression. Drawing insight from American chattel slavery and the situation of the German Jews during the 1930’s, I argue that to be oppressed is to be unjustly denied the opportunity for what I call ‘resilient autonomy’. I argue that all instances of oppression can usefully be analysed in these terms. I test my analysis against each of Young’s five structures of oppression, concluding that in each case they are captured by my analysis."

The U.S. sample includes 1,163 relatively wealthy and educated married respondents aged 19–84 years. The regression model, controlling for sociodemographic factors, social integration, self-rated health, and gender interactions, explained more than half the variability in respondents’ depressive symptoms. Regardless of age, wives who were closer to their husbands were less depressed than those who were less close. Older husbands were less depressed than younger ones. Marital closeness was protective for husbands at all ages with its absence particularly problematic at younger ages."

For instance, they have to adapt their behaviors when they browse e-commerce sites. Conducting similar transactions from wireless devices (e.g., mobile phones) requires new approaches. Multiple issues, which vary from low bandwidth and high latency to screen sizes, are raised. The E-Commerce Through Wireless Devices project aims at investigating techniques and offering solutions to support users in undertaking m-commerce transactions."

Gibson \nIn their studies of online media, political economists of communication have examined how firms like Google enclose users in a web of commercial surveillance, thus facilitating the commodification of their online labor. However, this focus on enclosure tends to overlook the political possibilities highlighted by autonomist Marxist theory—namely, that users, under certain circumstances, can appropriate these applications to contest conditions of exploitation. This article offers an analysis of Blog Cabin 2008, a cable home improvement show, in order to explore this tension between autonomy and enclosure. Our findings suggest that producers indeed used the show’s blog to exploit fans’ free labor. However, fans also used the blog to form social bonds, to press demands on the show’s producers, and to make connections between the show’s class politics and the wider financial crisis. A concluding section explores the theoretical and political significance of such unanticipated uses of the show’s blog."

They are also directed for satisfying personal needs and the attainment of pleasure. Describing leisure activities can help constructing and planning professional interventions that focus on healthy leisure activities and also help planning public policies. Data collection was conducted through the internet, with 273 students, who lived at many different Brazilian states. The concept of leisure is linked to the time free of obligations and the choice for leisure activities is related with variables such as gender, working status, if have children and socio-economic self-perception. The information is discussed considering how people interpret the leisure, their motivations and satisfaction with these choices.

Given the prominence of social media in contemporary life this is a significant current legal issue yet one which has attracted relatively little academic comment. This paper examines the compatibility of unfair dismissal doctrine in this context with traditional liberal principle. Arguably, doctrine provides only flimsy protection. Although the common law recognises the importance of individual autonomy generally when determining rights claims this well-established liberal value appears to have little influence on unfair dismissal doctrine. The dominant academic view on realising greater workplace human rights protection through greater application of the proportionality principle is unlikely to address this problem; reconceptualization of the substantive free speech right at stake is required. This paper offers a strategy on how this might be achieved – and so how differences between practice and principle might be reconciled – through a sympathetic reading of the Strasbourg and UK jurisprudence and potential policy-maker intervention."

This use of media is broadly protected under fair use exemptions to copyright, and creators of content used in experiments are generally not afforded any formal consideration or protections in existing research ethics frameworks. Online social networking sites are an emerging and important setting for social experiments, and in this context the material used to elicit responses is often content produced by other users. This article argues that users may have a reasonable interest in controlling the use of their content in experiments conducted in online social networks. Matters of risk and autonomy in research ethics are explored by analogy to active debates in law over adhesion contracts, moral rights, and the right to be forgotten. The article concludes by considering practical difficulties in identifying and protecting the interests of creators."

However as they mediate commercial relationships with third parties, software agents in turn raise new legal difficulties, while potentially heightening user fears and mistrust. The autonomy, adaptivity and interactivity of agents, combined with the advent of ubiquitous computing, introduce a new set of legal dimensions including the liability of agent users, the automation of notification and consent or the attribution of responsibility, as well as new fears for users. This article presents a process oriented analysis of agent activities, within the context of augmented reality: the application of Internet technologies to the real world, specifically in this case to supermarket shopping. Specific areas of difficulty are contract and consumer protection law, as well as privacy. These topics are highlighted, together with trust issues raised in Multi-Agent Systems which will be discussed in a later article in this series."

It provides a schedule manager as well as the possibility to report occurrences of symptomatic experiences. Receiving this information by Internet, caregivers can assist the patient rehabilitation process. Our aim was to explore the use and satisfaction of Mobus by people with schizophrenia. Nine outpatients tested Mobus for 6 weeks. Indicators of cognitive functioning and autonomy were measured with the CAmbridge Neuropsychological Tests Automated Battery (CANTAB) and the Independant Living Skills Scale (ILSS). On average, 42.6% of the planned ADL were validated and more than 1 symptom per week were reported. Mainly because of technical breakdown, more than 50% of the outpatients evaluated the Mobus satisfaction below 1.7/5, nevertheless 3 participants appreciated it greatly. Some enhancements were found on subscales of CANTAB and ILSS and some participants reported that they acquired planning skills by using Mobus. To ensure ease of use, refinements are needed from rehabilitation and technical approaches, especially to personalize the device. Discussions on ethical and methodological issues lead to an improved version of Mobus that will be tested with a larger sample size."

Slocum \nManagement control of professional employees such as engineers and scientists leads to a state of conflict in the business organization. To management, the control of human resources implies the limiting of individualistic behavior of subordinates in order to realize the objectives of the firm. In contrast, the industrial scientist, even as a subordinate in an organizational hierarchy, believes that control as applied to him should allow for autonomy and independence as attributes of professionalism in his work environment.\nIn this paper we examine various approaches to managerial control—traditional, bureaucratic, cybernetic, and behavioral—and their application to the engineer-scientist as the carrier of professional values in the work culture. A successful manager in this environment must create a work climate without emphasis on formal mechanisms of control and direction. Recent research indicates that to this effect optimum supervisory behavior involves neither excessive direction nor autonomy but frequent interaction with industrial scientists as participants in decision making.\nWe conclude that management of industrial scientists in relation to their professional values should take place within the networks of informal organizational relationships. It involves the application of normative managerial control based upon the exercise of self-imposed sanctions by the industrial scientists themselves, and of colleague authority by their managers relying on communication and information for compliance with organization’s objectives and goals."

However, this approach, due to the fact that the autonomic individual behaviors are difficult to be predicted and controlled, encounters the “trust” crisis of cooperation effect. In order to solve the above crisis, this paper proposes a model of Norm-Governed and Policy-Driven autonomic service cooperation (NGPD). The key idea of NGPD is to constrain and govern the cooperation behaviors and their evolutions of autonomic individuals by formulating systematic standards of social structures and the coupling norms of cooperation behaviors, and thereby the cooperation behaviors (i.e. behaviors for providing and requiring services) of autonomic individuals and the cooperation effect can be controlled, predicted, and then become trusted. Furthermore, NGPD provides the “macro-micro” link mode to support the operation-level implementation of macro-government and creates the policy-driven self-management mechanism for individual behaviors to achieve the mapping from the macro-government to the micro-behaviors. Thus, the effect of the macro-government can be exerted to autonomic individuals so that they can exhibit the intellect for conforming to service contracts and cooperation behavior norms, but still keep high autonomy again. Along with the settlement of this “trust” crisis, NGPD can overcome the limitation introduced by non-autonomic service cooperation, and thus make the autonomy and change-response ability of service cooperation exhibit the advantages of robustness and intelligence which cannot be reached by traditional service cooperation techniques. Furthermore, NGPD also establishes the solid foundation for developing the norm-driven and contract-ensured self-organization of hierarchical cooperation and the cooperation self-adaptation and self-evolution driven by contract-performing circumstance. All of these make the service cooperation-based VOs possess high performance of dynamical on-requirement self-organization and self-evolution."

Coyne \n Laura M. Padilla-Walker \n Emily Howard \nThis article reviews the recent literature on uses, effects, and gratifications of media during emerging adulthood. We examine traditional media forms, including television, films, video games, music, and books, and also newer media, such as cell phones, social networking sites, and other Internet use. We find that emerging adults spend more time using the media than they spend doing any other activity, with the most time being spent on the Internet and listening to music. We also find that exposure to certain types of media content can influence both positive and negative outcomes in emerging adulthood, including, aggressive and prosocial behavior, body image, sexual behavior, friendship quality, and academic achievement. We also show that emerging adults use the media to gratify certain needs; key among these are for autonomy, identity, and intimacy needs. Finally, we discuss areas for future research involving media and emerging adulthood."

Participants were 3,440 children aged 10 and 11 years in Northern Ireland who completed the KIDSCREEN-27 online as part of a general attitudinal survey. The questionnaire was animated using cartoon characters that are familiar to most children and the questions appeared on screen and were read aloud by actors. Exploratory principal component analysis of the online version of the questionnaire supported the existence of five components in line with the paper version. The items loaded on the components that would be expected based on previous findings with five domains—physical well-being, psychological well-being, autonomy and parents, social support and peers, and school environment. Internal consistency reliability of the five domains was measured using Cronbach’s alpha, and the results suggested that the scale scores were reliable. The domain scores were similar to those reported in the literature for the paper version. These results suggest that the factor structure and internal consistency reliability scores of the KIDSCREEN-27 embedded within an online survey are comparable to those reported in the literature for the paper version."

Focusing upon the appropriation of ICTs by local communities who have been disenfranchised by technological development, this agenda foregrounds uses of the Internet in the pursuit of distinctly community-related objectives. However, the role that the local state ought to play within this agenda for change remains marked by a degree of controversy and ambiguity. Assertions of the need for community autonomy coexist uneasily with a recognition that the local state can help develop and sustain CI. Much current work therefore focuses upon exploring notions of ‘partnership’ between the local state and local groups in developing CI. Against this background, this paper draws on a case study of Birmingham City Council (BCC) in order to explore a series of significant organizational changes to local government, which have seen BCC adopt …"

My two daughters were breast-fed with one hand while I typed away on the other. My family is scattered across Europe, Australia, and the United States and communicates daily through the Internet. My most heated marital arguments are often solved on the Internet. My colleague and I, sitting in a room barely able to contain our two desks and mountains of books and papers, exchange emails rather than turn our heads to interrupt the other’s flow of thought. Professionally, my editing, writing, networking, sharing of information and ideas is now almost completely based on e-mail exchanges with women and men around the world. For someone who professes very little technical skills and relies heavily on the young men around her to assist when the inevitable crashes occur, this transformation of my life by the Internet is somewhat curious. It appears to have stretched my mode of personal, professional, and social communication and wrapped itself around my psyche as I devote much emotional and creative energy to e-mail conversations. From my own experience and those of my network, I see the Internet as providing a new medium for women to work across communities, link up to diasporas and to women from other cultures that share the same concerns about women’s struggle for autonomy and self determination. It is unique medium in that it seems to give expression both to the personal and to the political. All of the women who participated in the survey are friends and allies, largely because we can stay in touch across the miles through the Internet. We shared important life events—babies born, family deaths, achievements of our campaigns, our thoughts in progress—almost in real time. The Internet has certainly strengthened our work and as created another facet of our lives. It has, oddly enough, also pushed for many more face-toface meetings, invitations, and political opportunities as people meet in cyberspace and then seek to put a face to a personality only understood from the screen. We are yet to understand fully its impact politically and personally, but for me it has enriched and extended my life and given me the opportunity to learn and work closely with women whom I see as part of both my local and global political and personal space or “glocality” where women can truly shape their lives."

The research was made of two phases to consolidate financial statement. First, fusion tables were created by merging the data from the four legally independent financial systems (the General Budget, the Revolving Fund, Chattel and Immovable Property Financial System). Then, based on international and national accounting standards, the fusion tables of 816 hospitals and health centers were consolidated as they were a single enterprise and explicit information on the methodology of consolidation was provided.

The results show an increasing individual autonomy among respondents, which also affects the drug R&D process in general. Human, liberal and ethical values are reported as crucial values to citizens. On this basis, respondents reported that patient organizations, representative citizen groups and ethical councils can contribute with important input to ensure these values in decision making concerning future drug R&D.

An enterprise is considered in the framework of multiagent methodology as a distributed computational system. The Agent-Oriented Abstraction paradigm was proposed earlier to describe in a fully generic way agents and societies of agents. In this paper, we are investigating the application of this paradigm to the abstract modeling of corporate knowledge, extending the scope of traditional knowledge management approaches. We show that such an abstraction mechanism leads to very practical applications for cyberworlds whether on the web or on any other medium. Our approach covers the broader possible scope of corporate knowledge, emphasizing the distributivity and autonomy of agents within cyber systems. This approach can be further used to better simulate and support knowledge management processes."

    "text": "Doc 184 :  Teachers of Teachers: Faculty Working Lives and Art Teacher Education in the United States \nhttps://doi.org/10.2307/1321031\n Lynn Powell Galbraith \nIntroduction Dream job: Working where valued as a professional art educator; teaching professionally committed students; working with quality school personnel; having time and support to continue active research and writing interests; working in a supportive and collegial atmosphere. (Professor) There is a developing consensus that the preparation of teachers should become central to art education research (Davis, 1990; Day, 1997; Galbraith, 1995; Zimmerman, 1994; 1997). Research exists on specific art teacher preparation programs (Carroll, Jones, & Sandell, 1995; Day, 1997; Galbraith, 1997; Sevigny, 1987; Thompson & Hardiman, 1991; Willis-Fisher, 1993; Zimmerman, 1997), and there is a growing interest in examining art preservice teachers’ beliefs about teaching art (Grauer 1998; Kowalchuk, 1999; Short, 1995). Yet there is a lack of research on college level faculty-the teachers of teachers-whose qualifications, expertise, beliefs, and practices, shape and define art education within over 600 diverse institutions that have some association with preparing art teachers today (Galbraith, 1997; Hutchens, 1997). This lack of attention to faculty issues is not surprising, given that the data on faculty members associated with teacher education, in general, is sparse (Ducharme & Ducharme, 1996; Howey & Zimpher, 1989; Murray, 1995). Ducharme (1993) suggested that faculty members who prepare teachers are formerly public school teachers who enter higher education to seek better rewards and to have more autonomy in their professional lives. Faculty work involves paying attention to issues affecting conditions of employment and institutional expectations (Boyer, 1990; Fullan, 1996). It also involves paying attention to decisions that affect job satisfaction, career patterns, as well as professional and personal happiness (Ducharme, 1993). As with teachers teaching in school settings (Goodson, 1992; Huberman, 1993), faculty work is intimately affected by daily interactions with students, colleagues, and administrators (Jordan, 1994). Who then are the art education college-level faculty members that prepare future art teachers? Where do they teach? What are their jobs like? What are their roles, responsibilities, and beliefs in relation to art teacher education? This article reports on data taken from an ongoing research project that aims to identify faculty who teach art education within the U.S., the institutions in which they teach, their specific faculty roles and responsibilities, and their practices and beliefs about art teacher education. Given the broad context of this research and its overall qualitative nature, my intention is to provide the reader with a sense of the issuesthe flavor-that part of this research has uncovered. To this end, I will report on where education faculty members teach, their qualifications, and what they teach, and on specific aspects of their job descriptions, especially those related to teaching and research. I will briefly discuss how selected faculty members view their jobs currently and in the best possible worlds. I will conclude with implications for developing a research agenda that studies art teacher education faculty. Data Sources The data for this article are taken from two sources: First, I sent an open-ended questionnaire to 500 faculty members who worked at a variety of institutions (e.g.; research, teaching, liberal arts, religious, professional art school, private, public, large, small, and so forth) within the U.S. Faculty names, addresses, and institutions were gathered from the NASA Higher Education Division membership list, intensive searches of institutional homepages on the Internet, annual NAEA Convention programs, and the Internet listserv associated with the NAEA Research Task Force on Teacher Education. Of the 500 questionnaires mailed, 167 were returned from 44 states, with a return rate of 33 percent. Of these, 19 questionnaires were unusable, because, for example, art education was no longer taught at that institution. …"

The purpose of this study was to identify the characteristics of fashion programs that are designed to improve the creativity of students. Six fashion schools in Western Europe and the United States were selected based on the number of graduates included in the Designer Handbook published by Fairchild Books. Two Korean professionals from each school were interviewed either by email or in person, resulting in a total of 12 interviews. The data were analyzed qualitatively. The results indicated that the management styles as well as the curricula of these schools include features that enhanced student creativity. The schools are located in major fashion cities and have a close relationship with industry that is maintained to provide hands-on opportunities to students. The schools have clear and solid educational goals with instructional styles that provide students significant autonomy and responsibility. The instructors work closely with individual students to guide them through their projects and help develop students` unique styles. The schools utilized the instructions and studios as well as the social and cultural environments to help students acquire creative thinking and creative behavioral patterns. The findings of this study have implications for educators who wish to develop effective educational programs that enhance student creativity."

Externalized CB expressions involving illusions and hallucinations with the deceased were distinguished from internalized CB expressions involving use of the deceased as an autonomy promoting secure base. 502 bereaved participants completed over the internet a CB measure assessing externalized and internalized CB along with various known risk-factor measures that included cause of death (i.e., violent vs. non-violent death), responsibility for the death, and attachment style as well as measures of psychological adjustment that included complicated grief symptoms, perceived physical health, and personal growth. As predicted, externalized CB was positively associated with violent death and responsibility for the death, whereas internalized CB was negatively associated with these risk factors as well as uniquely positively linked to personal growth. The implications of the findings for the role of CB in adjustment are discussed."

The discussion first explores research on the precursors of MUVEs, text-based 2D virtual worlds known as MOOs. This is followed by an examination of studies on the use of MUVEs in Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL). The discussion then focuses on an investigation of the Second Life-based text chat of learners located at a university in Japan. Data analysis reveals that the environment, and tasks, elicited types of collaborative interaction hypothesized as beneficial in the sociocultural account of language development. Collaborative interaction identified in the data involved peer-scaffolding focusing on lexis, and correction. The data further showed that the participants actively maintained a supportive atmosphere through the provision of utterances designed to signal interest, and the extensive use of positive politeness. These factors facilitated social cohesion, intersubjectivity, and the consistent production of coherent target language output focused on the tasks. Participant feedback was broadly positive, and indicates that specific features of Second Life such as individual avatars, coupled to the computer-based nature of the interaction, appeared to enhance discourse management, engagement, and participation. The findings suggest that Second Life provides an arena for learner centered social interaction that offers valuable opportunities for target language practice, and the development of autonomy. Areas of potential for future research are identified."

The five articles included in this volume cover service work, from the routine and clerical through to highly credentialed and professional work. Although some of the established challenges concerning the impact of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) on work and workplaces are evident in the articles, it is also clear that new service delivery processes demand new skills and training to some extent. Overall findings indicate that while ICT competencies are important, they need to be supplemented by the soft skills that are crucial for effective customer interactions and more open work systems with greater autonomy and participation whereby flexible work teams can have a positive impact on job quality outcomes. This introductory article examines technology and the changing nature of work through three strands of interpre…"

Modern scholarship usually approves deontological and utilitarian ethics as appropriate to computer ethics, while classical theories of ethics, such as virtue ethics, are usually neglected as anachronistic and unsuitable to the information era and ICT industry. During past decades, an Aristotelian form of virtue ethics has been revived in modern philosophical enquiries with serious attempts for application to computer ethics and cyberethics. In this paper, the author argues that current trends and behaviours in online communication require an ethics of self-care found in Plotinus’ self-centred virtue ethics theory. The paper supports the position that Plotinus’ virtue ethics of intellectual autonomy and self-determination is relevant to cyberethics discussions involved in computer education and online communication."

For both young men and women, greater sexual passivity predicts less overall sexual satisfaction.

Safety analysts can understand better the underlying causes of decision or action flaws by probing into the patterns of breakdown in the organization of safety. For this deeper analysis, a cybernetic model of organizational factors and a control model of human processes have been integrated in this article (i.e., the viable system model and the extended control model). The joint VSM-ECOM framework has been applied to a case study to help safety practitioners with the analysis of patterns of breakdown with regard to how operators and organizations manage goal conflicts, monitor work progress, recognize weak signals, align goals across teams, and adapt plans on the fly. The recursive accident representation brings together several organizational issues (e.g., the dilemma of autonomy versus compliance, or the interaction between structure and strategy) and addresses how operators adapt to challenges in their environment by adjusting their modes of functioning and recovery. Finally, it facilitates the transfer of knowledge from diverse incidents and near misses within similar domains of practice."

Results revealed the use of cell phones was a source of autonomy-connection conflict, with higher levels of tension related to more conflict over quantity of calling and texting and over use with the opposite sex. Commonly reported rules pertained to timing of calls and texts, although many reported no rules. Selection and Neutralization were employed to address the dialectical tension."

Evers \nAbstract This paper focuses on a most significant domain of inner power of teachers’ lives—their leadership of student learning. Traditional conceptions of teacher leadership owe much to the presumption of a classroom, or a formally designated site, where teacher instructed learning takes place. However, the rise of the Internet, with its ready availability of information has resulted in a shift towards much greater autonomy in student learning. The study reported here explores the perceptions of students, teachers, and parents about this shift to teacher-less learning, and the consequences it has for how we are to understand teacher leadership, especially where it concerns student engagement and participation in school. It also explores the efforts teachers themselves have made to understand their role amid these new realities."

The conceptual framework builds upon Bourdieu’s field theory, appropriated on social media as mediated social spaces. The study investigates conversation patterns on Twitter between political, media and citizen agents during election times in Belgium. Through the comparison of conversational practices with the positions users hold as political, media or citizen agents, we understand how the former is related to the latter. The analysis of conversation patterns (based on replies and mentions) shows a decentralized and loosely knit network, in which primarily citizen agents are present. Nonetheless, the prominence of citizens in the debate, mentions or replies to political and media agents are significantly higher, placing them more centrally in the network. In addition, politicians and media actors are closely connected within the network, and reciprocal communication of these established agents is significantly lower compared to citizen agents. We understand different aspects of autonomy related to the presence, positions and practices of the agents on Twitter and their relative positions as politicians, media or citizens. To conclude, we discuss the promises of Bourdieu’s relational sociology and the limitations of our study. The approach proposed here is an attempt to integrate existing work and evolve towards a systematic understanding of the interrelations between political, media and citizen agents in a networked media environment."

McCabe \nThe American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG), in their “Statement on Direct-to-Consumer Genetic Testing”1 (in this issue of Genetics in Medicine), argues for the involvement of appropriately qualified health care professionals in the ordering and interpretation of genetic tests, and the counseling of individuals and families regarding the meaning and significance of the test results. They point out the potential harms that may result if such health professionals are not involved, including misused tests, misinterpreted results, and misguided follow-up. We feel that this statement from the ACMG will not only educate the public and professionals about this issue, but will also lead to further discourse. In this commentary, we will provide a brief background for these discussions. One argument in favor of direct-to-consumer testing relies on respect for patient autonomy. Such reliance, however, ignores the need for information if autonomy and decisionmaking are to be meaningful. We acknowledge and cherish the autonomy of individuals to make decisions regarding their own health care. Geneticists show respect for and uphold autonomy through nondirective counseling. We agree with the ACMG, however, that decisions regarding whether and how an individual wishes to use a genetic test, and the information derived from it, should be informed by discussions with a knowledgeable health professional. Others argue that direct access to genetic testing reduces health care costs by eliminating the need for consultation with trained professionals. However, this argument fails to account for the costs likely to result from the uninformed and unnecessary uses of genetic tests and from the adverse consequences of inappropriate responses to test results, whether positive or negative, valid or invalid. Such consequences can include underuse and overuse of health care resources. Concerns regarding direct access to genetic testing are closely tied to concerns about direct-to-consumer advertising and marketing of genetic testing. Arguments have been made for direct-to-consumer marketing of genetic tests based on experience with direct-to-consumer advertisement of prescription drugs.2 Benefits cited by advocates include increased compliance and facilitation of patient-physician communication (based on the required “talk with your doctor” phrase). In the context of genetic tests, benefits of direct-to-consumer advertising may include an increased awareness of the importance of family history, the relation between risk and family history, the role of genetics in disease, and the value of genetic counseling. When advertisements for genetic tests are presented on the Internet or in the media by a commercial entity, however, significant clinical information may be missing. For example, there is frequently no information provided regarding the clinical validity and utility of the test. Consumers are not advised, for example, whether a test will provide the answers they are seeking regarding a particular disorder. An individual consumer is unlikely to know the positive predictive value (probability that a positive test result indicates the person will develop the disorder) or the negative predictive value (probability that a person will not develop a disorder if the test does not find a mutation) of the test. The consumer also is unlikely to know the performance characteristics of that test in the specific context in which they are requesting the test result; e.g., test performance may be very different in the presence or absence of a positive family history for the disease, or in the presence or absence of a known mutation. A consumer also may not be able to determine whether a particular genetic test is appropriate for them in the absence of consultation with a trained health professional.2 For example, a woman with a family history of breast cancer who is concerned about her risk for breast cancer (consultand) would do better to have a sample from an affected relative who meets the criteria for familial breast cancer (proband) tested for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 than to have her own sample tested. If the proband did not have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, then the consultand would be at no different risk for breast cancer before or after she was tested. An appropriately trained health professional can help the consultand identify the best proband(s) for initial testing in order for the consultand to receive the best and most useful information from their genetic testing.2,3 Without this kind of health professional involvement and counseling, direct-to-consumer advertising may reinforce an erroneous deterministic interrelationship between genotype and phenotype.4 An appropriately trained health professional also would be able to advise the consultand regarding the actual information that may be available from the test, as well as its potential utility. The difficulties encountered in the interpretation of genetic test results are well-recognized.3 The public generally expects to receive a definitive, yes/no answer from a medical test. Results from genetic tests often inform only the estimation of the probability of developing a disease or the predictive risk of From the Departments of Human Genetics and Pediatrics, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA; UCLA Center for Society, the Individual and Genetics; and Mattel Children’s Hospital at UCLA, Los Angeles, California."

In recent years, the internet has arisen as a viable alternative to these sites. Motivations for the pursuit of internet-based work are numerous and include perceptions of greater ease, convenience and accessibility; anonymity, autonomy and safety, but, above all, the potential for more lucrative returns. The article also highlights the seemingly large numbers of men using dating websites who are casually propositioned online and may consent to such proposals, suggesting further research is required to ascertain the characteristics and experiences of those involved in informal sex work activity."

Chiou \n Nancy J. Cooke \nProject overview As a team explores interactions, they may find opportunities to expand and refine teamwork over time. This can have consequences for team effectiveness in normal and unexpected situations (Woods, 2018). Understanding the role of exploratory team interactions may be relevant for human-autonomy team (HAT) resilience in the face of synthetic agent rigidity and lack of anticipation (Demir et al, 2019). Team interaction exploration was defined as team interactions with qualities (e.g. content, communication medium) unique to a team’s interaction history (Cooke et al., 2013; Hills et al., 2015). This study examines the relationship between team interaction exploration and HAT performance in multiple remotely-piloted aerial system (RPAS) reconnaissance missions with degraded conditions. The goal of the task was to take good photos of target waypoints. In this task, three teammates are assigned to specific roles: the navigator plans the route using a digital map, the pilot (synthetic) controls the RPAS and selects target waypoints, and the photographer calibrates camera settings to take a good photo of a target waypoint. The synthetic agent was capable of routine team coordination without explicit team player qualities. Teams communicated via a text-chat interface. Seven unique degraded conditions were injected throughout ten missions. Three automation failures disrupted RPAS status information on the photographer’s or pilot’s display, and three autonomy failures disrupted the synthetic agent’s comprehension of waypoint information or caused the agent to move on to the next target before a photo was taken. Finally, a malicious cyber-attack caused the synthetic agent to fly the RPAS to an enemy occupied waypoint. Method Forty-four participants were recruited from a large southwestern university in pairs and formed teams (22 teams) to participate in this study. These participants were either undergraduate or graduate students. This experiment consisted of ten 40-minute missions in total that were carried out over two sessions separated by one-to two-week intervals. After a baseline mission, an automation and autonomy failure was injected into each mission while the team processed target waypoints. The malicious cyber-attack occurred during the final 20-minutes of the tenth mission. This study collected a several measures including measures of team process, physiological measures, and surveys of teamwork knowledge, trust, workload, and anthropomorphism which are not considered in this study. Exploratory team interaction was operationalized as any text-message unique in content, sender, or recipient that was unrelated to routine coordination of target waypoints. Teams were grouped using k-means clustering by their target processing efficiency, number of overcome roadblocks, and mission performance. The three clusters ( K = 3) were comparatively described as low- ( N = 7), middle- ( N = 7), and high-performing ( N = 5) teams. A mixed-factor ANOVA compared the frequency of each team’s exploratory interactions by mission and cluster. Results and discussion High-performing teams were distinguished from middle-and low-performing teams in their ability to maintain high levels of overall performance while efficiently processing targets and overcoming many roadblocks. Middle-performing teams were efficient in overcoming roadblocks but had worse mission performance. The findings indicate that 1) high-performing teams explored team interactions more than middle-performing teams, 2) there was no significant difference in exploration frequency between high-and low-performing teams, and 3) teams explored more in the first session than the second session, with the exception of the final mission. Overall, exploratory team interaction differentiated HAT performance in normal and degraded conditions and should be further examined at other levels of interaction, such as content meaning and interaction patterns."

McNeese \n Manrong She \n Nancy J. Cooke \nProject Overview Team Situation Awareness (TSA), which is a part of team cognition, is a critical factor that influences team effectiveness. It can be defined as getting the right information from the right person within the right amount of time, in order to overcome an unexpected event (Gorman, Cooke, Pederson, Connor, & DeJoode, 2005). TSA is developed and maintained through team interactions, allowing for the measurement of TSA based on team interaction (Cooke & Gorman, 2009). In the current study, a specific measure, Coordinated Awareness of Situation by Teams (CAST) is used (Cooke & Gorman, 2009). CAST evaluates the effectiveness and efficiency of team interaction under “roadblock” scenarios (Gorman, Cooke, & Winner, 2006). These roadblocks represent novel situations in the task and require effective team communication and coordination. Team members must assess the situation according to their own specialized role and/or resources and coordinate with other team members to overcome each separate roadblock. In this task, effective communication refers to team anticipation. That is, each team member needs to anticipate each other’s needs by pushing information rather than pulling information during the task (Demir, McNeese, & Cooke, 2017). In this study, we examined how pushing and pulling information, and CAST were associated with Team Situation Awareness (TSA) in both Human-Autonomy (HAT) and all-human teams in simulated Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) task environment. In this research, we integrated the synthetic agent to the Cognitive Engineering Research on Team Tasks Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems - Synthetic Task Environment (CERTT-RPAS-STE) which was designed to be both a flexible research platform and a realistic task environment with a view to researching team performance and interaction-based measures of team cognition. In the simulated CERTT testbed, there are three heterogeneous teammates who need to take good photos of each target waypoint by communicating via text-chat: (1) the navigator who creates a dynamic flight plan and provides information about the waypoints, the RPA’s airspeed, and altitude restrictions to the pilot; (2) the pilot, who controls the RPA’s heading, altitude, and airspeed, and negotiates with the photographer in order to take a good photo; and (3) the photographer, who monitors sensor equipment in order to take photographs of target waypoints and sends feedback to the other team members about the quality of the photo. This project aimed to understand how team behaviors and team performance differed between HATs and all-human teams in RPAS operations: (1) the synthetic condition—the pilot role was given to the synthetic teammate, which was an ACT-R based cognitive model (which had a limited interaction ability, see Ball et al., 2010; Demir et al., 2015); (2) the control condition—the pilot was a randomly selected human participant, just like the other two participants; and (3) the experimenter condition—one of the experimenters served as an expert pilot. Experimenter condition utilized a Wizard of Oz paradigm in which a trained experimenter (located in a separate room) used a script to imitate a synthetic teammate and communicated with participants in limited communication behaviors but pushing and pulling information in a timely manner (robust coordination). Method There were 30 teams (10 for each condition): control teams consisted of three participants randomly assigned to each role; synthetic and experimenter teams included two participants randomly assigned to the navigator and photographer roles. The experiment took place over five 40-minute missions, and the goal was to take as many “good” photos of ground targets as possible while avoiding alarms and rule violations. During each mission, teams were presented with “roadblocks” by the introduction of a new, ad hoc target waypoint. We collected several measures, but we focused on: the proportion of roadblocks overcome per mission as an outcome measure of TSA; the CAST which is a coordination sequence of team interaction across the team members (i.e. which team members share with team members their experience during the roadblock); and verbal behaviors such as pushing and pulling information. Results and discussion In this team task, effective teamwork involves anticipating the needs of teammates, which in turn means pushing information before it is requested. However, in addition to anticipation, effective coordination is also needed during roadblocks. HATs demonstrated significantly lower levels of CAST than all-human teams. These results indicate that HATs’ lack of anticipation and coordination resulted in poorer TSA performance. These findings help HATs to grow its coordination and communication methodologies. Finally, future studies might examine the relationships highlighted in this study via nonlinear measures in terms of team stability and flexibility based on their communication and coordination patterns during the novel events. HAT is here to stay but improvements to human-machine interactions must continue if we are to improve team effectiveness."

McNeese \n Nancy J. Cooke \n David Grimm \n Jamie C. Gorman \nProject overview Team resilience is an interactive and dynamic process that develops over time while a team maintains performance. This study aims to empirically investigate systems-level resilience in a Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) System simulated task environment by examining team interaction during novel events. The approach used in the current study to measure systems-level resilience was developed by Hoffman & Hancock (2017). In their conceptual study, resilience was considered a key feature of success in emerging complex sociotechnical systems; in our case, that is applied to Human-Autonomy Teams (HATs). Hoffman and Hancock conceptualized a resilience measure dynamically by means of several components, such as the time it took the system to recognize and characterize anomalies, and the time taken to specify and achieve new goals. In their framework, there were two main sub-events which expressed resilience via time-based measures, and upon which we designed ours in this study: (1) time taken to design a new process and (2) time required to implement it (Hoffman & Hancock, 2017). Design In this current research, there were three heterogeneous team members who used a text-based system to communicate and successfully photograph target waypoints: (1) navigator – provided information regarding a flight plan with speed and altitude restrictions of each waypoint; (2) pilot – controlled the RPA by adjusting its altitude and airspeed through negotiating with the photographer in order to take a good photo of the target waypoints; and (3) photographer – screened camera settings and sent feedback to the other team members regarding the status of target’s photograph. This study followed the Wizard of Oz paradigm wherein the navigator and photographer were seated together in one room and were told that the pilot was a synthetic agent. In actuality, the pilot was a well-trained experimenter who was working from a separate room. This ‘synthetic’ pilot used restricted vocabulary to simulate that of a computer. The main manipulations in this study consisted of three degraded conditions: (1) automation failure - role-level display failures while processing specific targets, (2) autonomy failure - autonomous agent behaved abnormally while processing specific targets (i.e., it provided misinformation to other team members or demonstrated incorrect actions), and (3) malicious cyber-attacks - the hijacking of the synthetic agent, which led to the synthetic agent providing false, detrimental information to the team about the RPA destination. Because the malicious cyber-attack only occurred once (during the final mission), we will focus on the automation and autonomy failures for this study. Each failure was imposed at a selected target waypoint and the teams had to find a solution in a limited amount of time. The time limit for each failure was related to the difficulty of the failure. Each failure was introduced at a pre-selected target waypoint for each team. Method In this experiment, there were 22 teams, with only two participants randomly assigned to the navigator and photographer roles for each team, because the pilot was a highly-trained experimenter. The current task was comprised of ten 40-minute missions in which teams needed to take as many “good” photos as possible of ground targets while avoiding alarms and rule violations. For this study, using the RPAS paradigm, we calculated two team resilience scores (1) time taken to design a new process and (2) time required to implement it (Hoffman & Hancock, 2017). For the calculations, we used the message sent time (in seconds) for each role to express resilience in terms of the proportion of total task time (2400 seconds). As an outcome measure, we used target processing efficiency as a coordination and time-based performance score, which was based on how quickly teams were able to take a good photo of each target. Results and discussion We found that teams were more resilient during automation failures and progressed toward targets more successfully than during autonomy failures. We see three possible explanations for this: (1) automation failures were more explicit than autonomy failures, since at least one team member interacted with other teammates; (2) autonomy failures took more time for human teammates to identify the failure, because the autonomous agent’s abnormal behavior was not as straight forward; and 3) human teammates overtrusted to the autonomous agent and lack confidence in themselves and let the failure go on.

Katz \nThe possibility that mobile communication is able to extend human freedom is an intriguing prospect, and one that certainly seems confirmed by recent events. The possibility also raises fundamental questions about the use and consequences of mobile communication not only at the marco-political level but also at the micro-social interaction level. This paper examines selected topics related to the way in which mobile communication technology is used in microsettings, and that are broadly to the theme of personal freedom and individual responsibility. It begins by assessing the situation in the United States in terms of broad mobile phone adoption patterns. Highlights are then presented of several studies undertaken at Rutgers University’s Center for Mobile Communication Studies; these illuminate how issues of personal autonomy and social control are played out through mobile communication practices. Among the topics included are technology display rates in public places, pretend usages, and utilization by students (and professors) in educational settings. Also discussed are some unexpected consequences of mobile communication adoption for women from India. While these topics are diverse, they are linked thematically around personal actions in social settings and institutionally by their central concern to the Rutgers Center for Mobile Communication Studies. The author concludes by urging continued examination by scholars of the profound questions of human freedom and its advancement that are raised by the enormous and continuing success, as well as sporadic abuse, of mobile communication technology."

    "text": "Doc 1108 :  Re-envisioning Asynchronous Communication \nhttps://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=3443065\n Meg V. B. Wood \nAbstract Facilitating a collaborative community in an online class takes a delicate balance of technology and personal communication. This article explores the use of asynchronous tools, including threaded discussions, announcements, and personal emails to create and maintain a high-touch online classroom. The resulting course structure both increases student autonomy and enhances instructor efficacy. Introduction In fall 2003, I accepted a position that required me to adapt a core professional and technical writing course at the University of Wyoming (UW) to a virtual classroom. As an instructor for the only baccalaureate-degree-granting institution in Wyoming–a large, rural state with significant economic and educational diversity–I was used to serving a broad population with diverse learning styles and needs. Furthermore, I knew that although the technologies and processes in Web-based instruction provide flexibility for the distance learner, they also can produce specific challenges (DeTure 21). Nevertheless, I was unprepared for the glut of individual communications and the volume of personal attention my would require. Since then, I have developed the use of asynchronous tools to limit the repetitive, individual communications that overwhelmed me during my early semesters teaching online. Instead of relying on email for mass communication, for example, I now use the course platform’s built-in Announcements tool. I also rely heavily on the materials posted on the course website and on students’ expertise with online learning in my responses to individual student inquiries. Finally, I continue building infrastructure into my course Home area. I have dubbed the resulting online course, which relies heavily on student-teacher and student-student communication, high-tech, high-touch. On the following pages, I discuss the development and application of these techniques. After a brief review of current literature and research into online teaching and learning, I contextualize my discussion by introducing course strategies and objectives. Next, I briefly overview the course platform, and finally, I discuss how I have used asynchronous tools, including threaded discussions, announcements, and email both to facilitate community in the online classroom and to manage my teaching time more efficiently. Background In February 2004, the Conference on Composition and Communication (CCCC) issued a position statement identifying numerous best practices for faculty teaching writing and composition in the online environment. According to these guidelines, successful online instruction encourages contacts between student and faculty, develops reciprocity and cooperation among students, and uses active learning techniques (Yancey et al., par. 15). Indeed, as Cheng-Chang Pen and Michael Sullivan assert, communication is always a top priority in an online [teaching] environment (par. 1). In College Students’ Perceptions of Quality in Distance Education: The Importance of Communication, Madeline Ortiz-Rodriguez et al. affirm this assertion: Students related quality in with the following features: interaction between and instructors, and between and students; timely feedback from instructors; and availability and accessibility of teaching assistants, facilitators, professors, help staff, and technical staff (101). Communication in the online environment, however, is unlike the spontaneous that takes place in a physical classroom. Although course management systems (CMS) include synchronous tools, such as chat rooms and white boards, as Alvin Wang and Michael Newlin explain, most Web-based courses rely primarily on asynchronous to deliver course information to students (par. 1). Furthermore, the very nature of online creates expectations of constant and immediate availability of faculty. …"

India has the one of the largest system of higher education in the world with 33,023 institutes (UGC,2012) compared with 6,742 in the US and 4,297 in China(FICCI, E&Y Report, 2011). However in terms of quality only one Indian university, IIT Bombay (317th rank) appear in top 400 universities of the world according to Times Higher Education 2012. Several committees and experts have argued that affiliation system needs to be reformed to reduce the burden on affiliating universities and improve quality. Reforming affiliation system requires an alternative which promotes autonomy, innovation, and better management. The paper concludes with recommendations for promoting clusters, information and communication technology (ICT), reducing political influence, autonomous colleges and streamlining regulatory framework."

Digitalization, enhanced storage capacities, and the Internet of Things increase the volume of data in modern organizations. To process and make use of these data and to avoid information overload, management information systems (MIS) are introduced that collect, process, and analyze relevant data. However, a precondition for the application of MIS is that users trust them. Extending accounts of trust in automation and trust in technology, we introduce a new model of trust in MIS that addresses the conceptual ambiguities of existing conceptualizations of trust and integrates initial empirical work in this field. In doing so, we differentiate between perceived trustworthiness of an MIS, experienced trust in an MIS, intentions to use an MIS, and actual use of an MIS. Moreover, we consider users’ perceived risks and contextual factors (e. g., autonomy at work) as moderators. The introduced model offers guidelines for future research and initial suggestions to foster trust-based MIS use."

Industry 4.0, based on increasingly progressive digitalization, is a global phenomenon that affects every part of our work. The Internet of Things (IoT) is pushing the process of automation, culminating in the total autonomy of cyber-physical systems. This process is accompanied by a massive amount of data, information, and new dimensions of flexibility. As the amount of available data increases, their specific timeliness decreases. Mastering Industry 4.0 requires humans to master the new dimensions of information and to adapt to relevant ongoing changes. Intentional forgetting can make a difference in this context, as it discards nonprevailing information and actions in favor of prevailing ones. Intentional forgetting is the basis of any adaptation to change, as it ensures that nonprevailing memory items are not retrieved while prevailing ones are retained. This study presents a novel experimental approach that was introduced in a learning factory (the Research and Application Center Industry 4.0) to investigate intentional forgetting as it applies to production routines. In the first experiment ( N = 18), in which the participants collectively performed 3046 routine related actions (t1 = 1402, t2 = 1644), the results showed that highly proceduralized actions were more difficult to forget than actions that were less well-learned. Additionally, we found that the quality of cues that trigger the execution of routine actions had no effect on the extent of intentional forgetting."

Susmitha \nFall detection for elderly and patient is a very important service that has the potential of increasing autonomy of elders while minimizing the risks of living alone. It has been an active research topic due to the fact that the health care industry has a big demand for products and technology of fall detection systems. Owing to the recent rapid advancement in sensing and wireless communication technologies, fall detection systems have become possible. They allow detecting fall events for the elderly, monitoring them, and consequently providing necessary help whenever needed. This paper describes the ongoing work of detecting falls in independent living senior apartments using force sensors and 3-axis accelerometers concealed under intelligent tiles. The force sensors permit detecting elders’ falls, locating, tracking and recognizing human activities (walking, standing, sitting, lying down, falling, and the transitions between them). However, the detection accuracy of real data contains false alarms coming from falling and lying postures. To solve this issue, we propose the fusion between the force sensor measurements and the accelerometer sensor decisions. As a consequence, the system accuracy is satisfactory and the results show that the proposed methods are efficient, and they can be easily used in a real elder tracking and fall detection system. The Internet-of-Things (IoT) has taken the business spectrum, and its applications vary widely from agriculture and health care to transportation. A hospital atmosphere is terribly nerve-wracking, particularly for senior voters and youngsters. With the ever-increasing world population, the standard patient-doctor appointment has lost its effectiveness. Hence, good health care becomes vital. good health care is enforced the least bit levels, ranging from temperature observation for babies to pursuit very important signs within the senior. The complexness and value of implementation vary supported the specified preciseness of the individual devices, functionalities, and class of the appliance that they’re used."

Harteveld \nThis article highlights the dynamics of values in our reasoning on public space. By means of an epistemological study, illustrated by examples in the Dutch city of Amsterdam, it tests the contemporary premises underlying our ways to safeguard the inclusive, democratic, agential city, and, as such, it aims to update our view on public space. The article raises three subsequent questions: [i] Is the city our common house as perceived from the Renaissance onward, containing all, and consequently are public spaces used by the people as a whole? [ii] Is the city formalising our municipal autonomy as emphasised since the Enlightenment, in an anti-egoistic manner, and in this line, are public spaces owned by local governments representing the people? And, [iii] is the city open to our general view as advocated in Modern reasoning, restricting entrepreneurial influences, and synchronically, are its public spaces seen and/or known by everyone? Inclusiveness, democracy, and ‘agentiality’ are strongholds in our scientific thinking on public space and each issue echoes through in an aim to keep cities connected and accessible, fair and vital, and open and social. Yet, conflicts appear between generally-accepted definitions and what we see in the city. Primarily based upon confronting philosophy with the Amsterdam case for this matter, the answering of questions generates remarks on this aim. Contemporary Western illuminations on pro-active citizens, participatory societies, and effects of, among others, global travel, migration, social media and micro-blogging forecast a more differentiated image of public space and surmise to enforce diversification in our value framework in urban theory and praxis."

In view of the obvious problems of governance under conditions of a global market society, the question arises whether there is evidence for an emerging democracy where consumers assume civic responsibility and exert a civilizing influence upon the economic realm. Consumers are traditionally associated with the private sphere whereas are viewed as belonging to the public sphere. The figure of consumer challenges such a clear-cut distinction (Negt/Kluge [1972, 7] already questioned it long ago). Yet, at the same time, the hybrid notion of consumer perpetuates the distinction of public and private. Rather than rendering the distinction obsolete, it points to shifting boundaries and the lines of demarcation between public and private being redrawn as an outcome of continuous social struggles and negotiations. Benjamin Barber (2007, 126, also 294 ff.), who sees a threat to democracy in widespread infantilization spurred by industries, fears a dilution of the concept of citizen by lumping it together with the notion of consumer. (1) The political sphere, he claims, is experiencing a loss of autonomy–an autonomy that emanates from public deliberation and the setting of collectively binding norms, the sovereignty of which must be asserted against the economic domain. For this reason, Barber wishes for self-confident of a democratic polity, whose individual mastery of life involves the ability of maintaining the differentiation of societal domains. Nonetheless, he too must take consumption as a facet of lifeworlds and life practices into account along with the problems it poses for civic involvement. We are at once consumers and and hence have no choice but to somehow reconcile the two sides that make up our personality–be it through strict separation or by other means. The conception of citizen serves to shed light on the forms such reconciliation may take–including the range of historical and empirical manifestations–not more and not less. (2) In this article, I approach the question of whether and how consumers as consumer citizens establish democracy by drawing on various theoretical building blocks from sociology. I will make use of the different dimensions contained in the notion of constitution, starting with the constitution of the social through action, through the politico-legal or institutional conditions constituting the citizen, to the current state of the citizen. Specifically, I will briefly discuss the citizen in five steps: from the angles of general social theory, socialization theory, the theory of modern society, from the view of current social trends, and in the light of considerations from the theory of democracy. The Internet, as a new means of networking, will serve as an empirical research area for exemplifying and specifying the theoretical considerations. 2 Social theory: the citizen as a form of constituting the subject in everyday practice At a first and general level of social theory, the question of how actors constitute the social will be addressed, which, as we all know, has been an object of considerable controversy in sociology. Approaching the issue from a theory of constitution (for instance Giddens 1984) implies that democracy cannot be conceived simply as a self-sustaining institutional order; rather actors, in this case citizens, must constantly produce and reproduce the structures of such an order. This said, we must first of all note that from the perspective of social theory consumption would be gravely misconceived as a passive, heteronomous activity. Rather consumption practices involve elements of active action, just as the domains of work and politics do, which are much more likely to be associated with exerting influence, exercising power, and with change. …"

The purpose of this study is to analyse the acceptance of medical devices that are based on IoT technology and monitor the health of individuals/patients. Most IoT medical initiatives have been focused on remote monitoring, improving patient care through various sensors and data processing those measures, for example, patients’ vital signs. In medical services trust plays a key role in the patients’ decision to adopt IoT technologies in medical industry. For this analysis, the Technology Acceptance Model was adopted in order to explain the way users accept and utilize these new medical devices that are based on IoT technology. The model was also used in order to identify those factors that influence the patients’ decision of accepting this technology and also analyse the way they use it. Cross-sectional data were collected from 96 patients through a survey. Data were then analysed by means of multiple regression analysis. The findings verified the research hypotheses. Thus, different securities challenges could face the adoption of the IoT. In addition, privacy requirements are another major challenge in using these technologies. Risks arise where devices and applications are untested, resulting in issues with interoperability, stability, compatibility and data security. For the elderly and people with disabilities, these IoT provisions are very useful in providing autonomy, a personalized approach and permanent monitoring. The theoretical contributions and practical implications of the study are discusses."

V. Gurylina \nStaffing problems (including staff shortage) in nursing reveal the connection with the stereotypical perception of the profession. The study of stereotypes was limited to Moscow healthcare and was based on downloading messages from social media (31,613 posts), the relevance of their study is determined by the growth of social media influence on public opinion. 24% of messages about nurses in the sample contain “large” stereotypical images (excluding spam). It was studied four “large” stereotypical images of a nurse: “guardian angel”, “doctor’s assistant”, “authoritarian nurse” and “sensual nurse”, and each one has negative aspects. Authors considered the specific perception of each of the images in social media. The remaining 76% of messages do not offer an alternative image of a nurse. The conclusion offers recommendations aimed at increasing the prestige of the profession: creating a new positive image of the profession, promoting it, encouraging nurses to join public space and increasing their autonomy."

These forms of feedback are often not systematically monitored and interpreted by universities. The purpose of this paper is to analyse quantitative ratings and qualitative comments provided by students via Google reviews of 40 Australian universities. The qualitative comments were analysed via thematic coding which identified four key themes including quality of teaching, course design, learning environment and administrative support. The data were also subjected to automated content analysis using the text analytics software Leximancer to enhance the objectivity and reliability of findings. Design/methodology/approach The study involved the extraction of quantitative ratings as well as qualitative comments from Google reviews of 40 Australian universities. Each university was searched on Google and their rating and comments were collected as of August 2019. The qualitative data were included in an Excel spreadsheet along with the name of the universities, and their quantitative ratings. Using thematic coding techniques, the qualitative data were manually coded into four themes: quality of teaching, course design, learning environment and administrative support. Furthermore, the qualitative comments were grouped into two categories: positive comments and negative comments. Findings The paper argues the need for universities to actively monitor these new forms of student feedback which have provided autonomy and freedom for students and other stakeholders to access and provide 24/7 feedback. The study found common themes emerging from the positive and negative student comments related to: quality of teaching, course design, learning environments and administrative support. These aspects contributed to the students’ satisfaction levels when they reflected on their educational experience on Google reviews. The study also found that institutions with high numbers of negative comments tend to have lower ratings compared to those with positive comments. Research limitations/implications The study did not use other learning analytic tools to measure and assess the feedback from students using social media and other forms of feedback. Originality/value Many studies have been undertaken on student experience. Studies have focussed on the experience of home and international students, on-campus and online students, and students from various underrepresented backgrounds. So far no study has been undertaken on the reviews provided by students using Google reviews."

Livingstone \nWith the introduction of more modern instructional practices, the traditional approach to learning and teaching is becoming ever more obsolete. Education practitioners all over the world have been calling for educational institutions, in both developed and developing countries, to improve pedagogical practices as a means of significantly enhancing learner experiences and outcomes in the learning-teaching process. There is evidence that rapid technological changes are taking place in the educational landscape and that the utilisation of Information and Communication Technologies in the instructional process is becoming more and more mandatory. Bearing in mind the afore-mentioned, the objective of this discussion is to underscore the place of Information and Communication Technologies in curriculum design and development. The focus of this discussion and review of literature is on curriculum and what it entails, the importance of curriculum, curriculum design and development, and ICTs and curriculum design and development (which looks at learning theories and ICT-based curricula, integration of ICTs into educational curricula, integration of ICTs into foreign language curricula, and the need for ICT-based curricula). Special consideration is given to ICT-based foreign language curricula because of the increasing importance of language didactics and foreign language education today. Information and Communication Technologies should be considered and integrated into educational curricula because they can revolutionise instructional practices and stimulate pedagogical innovation; foster learner engagement; cater for student learning diversity; promote learner independence and autonomy; increase learner interaction and communication, and support intellectual expressiveness and creativity of learners, application, and lifelong learning."

Barrett \n Machdel Matthee \nThere is a move towards a future in which consumers of technology are untethered from the devices and technology use becomes subliminal. With this increasing device opacity, loss of user control and increasing device autonomy, there are calls for more research on users’ privacy and freedom of choice. There are, however, key figures in the creation of modern technologies who suggest that consumers are informed of the implications of the use of these technologies or, that consumers use the technologies willingly. This paper examines, using Critical Discourse Analysis, two genres of IT-related communication viz. a speech made by the CEO of Facebook, the largest social-networking site and, the privacy policy document of Truecaller, said to be the most-downloaded app in Africa. Furthermore, 25 Sub-Saharan African users were interviewed on their use and understanding of smartphones. The analysis reveals concerns of consumers regarding the absence of choice, a lack of knowledge and information privacy erosion are not unfounded. The results show also that with the speech and policy document alike, there was information that was distorted or omitted. The conclusion was that the discourses surrounding context-awareness, through confusion, misrepresentations, false assurances and illegitimacy, contribute to information imbalances and asymmetry but most importantly, an uninformed consumer."

For a sample of 214 ethnically diverse adolescents, this research used direct observation to investigate the frequency, content, and timing of texting with parents, peers, and romantic partners through grades 9-12. Analyses showed that texting frequency follows a curvilinear trajectory, peaking in eleventh grade. Adolescents discussed a range of topics, predominantly with peers. Communication with parents was less frequent, but consistent over time. Approximately 45-65% of adolescents communicated with romantic partners, texting heavily and about topics similar to those discussed with peers. Texting may help adolescents navigate key developmental challenges of adolescence-the establishment of autonomy, intimate peer relationships, romantic relationships, and self-identity."

Lewis \n Colin Agur \nAbstract This article explores the institutional logics of intrapreneurial units, or groups within organizations that are designated to foster organizational innovation. Drawing on interviews with news intrapreneurs developing chatbots in news media organizations, this study shows that innovation can be stymied because of conflicting institutional logics. News intrapreneurs adopt a logic of experimentation, audience orientation, and efficiency-seeking, but that approach clashes with a journalistic logic prioritizing news workflows, formats, and associated autonomy for newsworkers. These clashing logics limit the adoption and influence of chatbots. This study illustrates the shaping influence of competing institutional logics and their negotiation in the development, deployment, and success or failure of intrapreneurial activities within organizations. The lesson is not that the existence of competing logics is, by default, a defeating proposition for innovation. Rather, this study advances scholarly understanding of the role of institutional logics in frustrating or facilitating technological adoption in organizations."

Matwyshyn \nThis Article introduces the ongoing progression of the Internet of Things (IoT) into the Internet of Bodies (IoB)—a network of human bodies whose integrity and functionality rely at least in part on the Internet and related technologies, such as artificial intelligence. IoB devices will evidence the same categories of legacy security flaws that have plagued IoT devices. However, unlike most IoT, IoB technologies will directly, physically harm human bodies—a set of harms courts, legislators, and regulators will deem worthy of legal redress. As such, IoB will herald the arrival of (some forms of) corporate software liability and a new legal and policy battle over the integrity of the human body and mind. Framing this integrity battle in light of current regulatory approaches, this Article offers a set of specific innovation-sensitive proposals to bolster corporate conduct safeguards through regulatory agency action, contract, tort, intellectual property, and secured transactions/bankruptcy.\nYet, the challenges of IoB are not purely legal in nature. The social integration of IoB will also not be seamless. As bits and bodies meld and as human flesh becomes permanently entwined with hardware, software, and algorithms, IoB will test our norms and values as a society. In particular, it will challenge notions of human autonomy and self-governance. Legal scholars have traditionally considered Kantian autonomy as the paradigmatic lens for legal determinations impacting the human body. However, IoB threatens to undermine a fundamental precondition of Kantian autonomy—Kantian heautonomy. Damaged heautonomy renders both Kantian autonomy and deliberative democracy potentially compromised. As such, this Article argues that safeguarding heautonomy should constitute the animating legal principle for governance of IoB bodies. The Article concludes by introducing the companion essay to this Article, The Internet of Latour’s Things. This companion essay inspired by the work of Bruno Latour offers a sliding scale of “technohumanity” as a framework for the legal and policy discussion of what it means to be “human” in an age where bodies are the “things” connected to the Internet."

While the Colombia-based collective, Ojo al Sancocho, has struggled to build bridges among urban and migratory communities uprooted by an entrenched, decades-old armed conflict, the Ecuadorian group, El Churo Comunicacin, has fostered audiovisual autonomy and resistance among indigenous, feminist and ecological social movements that have had to defend their rights even though they were supposedly guaranteed by a so-called progressive government. Despite formidable challenges, each has fulfilled a long-held dream - a community movie theater, and the expansion of a radio-based practice to a multiplicity of practices that include community filmmaking, cyberfeminism and capacity-building of communities across Ecuador and Latin America. Together with other collectives, Ojo al Sancocho and El Churo are building a network of community filmmakers across Latin America.

However, in recent years symbolic AI has been complemented and sometimes replaced by (Deep) Neural Networks and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. This has vastly increased its potential utility and impact on society, with the consequence that the ethical debate has gone mainstream. Such a debate has primarily focused on principles—the ‘what’ of AI ethics (beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice and explicability)—rather than on practices, the ‘how.’ Awareness of the potential issues is increasing at a fast rate, but the AI community’s ability to take action to mitigate the associated risks is still at its infancy. Our intention in presenting this research is to contribute to closing the gap between principles and practices by constructing a typology that may help practically-minded developers apply ethics at each stage of the Machine Learning development pipeline, and to signal to researchers where further work is needed. The focus is exclusively on Machine Learning, but it is hoped that the results of this research may be easily applicable to other branches of AI. The article outlines the research method for creating this typology, the initial findings, and provides a summary of future research needs."

Shekhavtsova \n K. O.

It is determined that the podcast is a meaningfully completed and informationally self-sufficient audio file that reflects the characteristics of speech, consciousness and thinking of speakers of a particular language and sociocultural traditions. Due to the analysis of various classifications of podcasts, some scientists have established that there is no generally accepted classification. The complexity of their classification lies in the fact that there are many criterias by which we can classify podcasts in accordance with: 1) the purpose of use; 2) the level of language training of the target audience; 3) the study of individual sections of linguistics; 4) topics; 5) genres. It is proved that the Internet technology of podcasting is based on the basics of technical and didactic characteristics: authenticity, autonomy (distance), relevance, formation of competence in the field of media and Internet technologies, interactivity, performance and use of a mobile technical device outside the school. The key point in the selection of podcasts is the definition and justification of the relevant linguistic criteria (phonetic, lexical and grammatical)."

The model is adapted from technology for social inclusion research addressing persistent inequalities in Internet use. First, the proposed model is introduced with definitions for the six dimensions (course purpose, technology, social support, autonomy, learning materials and skills) and research propositions for how the dimensions enable and constrain learning. A qualitative synthesis of empirically tested open and online programs (including massive open online courses) is used to clarify how the six critical dimensions interact to enable and constrain diverse learners in distance and blended modes. Results support the model with new definitions for each dimension in light of unexpected findings: courses designed to enable particular groups; breadth of learner supports; technology amplifying other dimensions; and aspects of the model designed to empower disadvantaged learners. This model should assist course design research and practice at higher education institutions where open and online provision for diverse and educationally disadvantaged learners is the current or approaching reality."

As digital technologies are an integral part of older adults’ environments, we predicted that the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) is associated with subjective well-being among the oldest-old. Specifically, we compared different user groups of ICT devices (nonusers, users of nonweb-connected ICT, users of web-connected ICT) and analyzed the relations among ICT use and three domains of subjective well-being (loneliness, anomie, autonomy).We performed a quantitative data analysis using data from the first representative state-wide survey study in North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany on quality of life and well-being of the oldest-old (n = 1,698; age range: 80-103; 9% long-term care). Multiple regression analyses were applied.The findings revealed that 25.9% of all individuals aged 80 years and older reported using web-connected ICT, in contrast to 38.5% who do not use ICT at all. Individuals who used web-connected ICT reported lower levels of loneliness and anomie, and higher levels of autonomy. These differences remain significant when controlling for indicators of social inclusion and individual characteristics.This study investigated an underexplored group in terms of ICT use, shedding light on the relationship between ICT use and subjective well-being. The oldest-old generally use ICT in their everyday life but an age-related digital divide still exists. To avoid negative consequences of nonuse digital infrastructures and technology training for older adults need to be established."

This study addresses flipped learning as an innovative approach in the teaching and learning processes of physical education at two educational stages, primary and secondary education. The objective of this study is to analyze the effectiveness of flipped learning with respect to traditional methodology. A descriptive and correlational experimental research design was used through a quantitative perspective. Two study groups were established, one control (traditional methodology) and one experimental (flipped learning) in each educational stage. A total of 119 students from an educational center in Ceuta (Spain) participated. These participants were chosen intentionally. The data were collected through a questionnaire. The results show that the experimental group obtained better evaluations in the academic indicators, highlighting the motivation, autonomy, and interactions between the different agents. Regarding the effectiveness of flipped learning according to the educational stage, its potential was demonstrated in both stages, highlighting a significant improvement in autonomy in secondary education."

But what makes something rape? Initially, only penial-vagina forceful penetration; then, other forceful penial penetrations were added, oral and anal; and later the forceful insertion of inanimate objects as well. The requirement of using force lost its exclusiveness and much of its normative power, paving the way for other kinds of rape: sex by non-forceful coercion, sex by sedation, sex with incompetent victims, sex by fraud, and other forms of problematic sex. The normative debate about each form is ongoing, and in a manner of speaking, rape is a limitless idea. Where will the rape offense go next?\nCyberspace, apparently. The Israeli Supreme Court has recently affirmed convictions of rape performed by distant words. The perpetrators conversed with children, teenagers and adult women online, using fraud and blackmail to manipulate them into masturbation and self-penetration. This groundbreaking judicial development is the inspiration to a normative analysis, revolving around Western notions of rape. Should such ill-intended communications constitute rape?\nThe article will normatively scrutinize the virtual rape thesis. It will analytically deconstruct the normative notion of rape into three facets, and examine each separately: the physics of the offensive scenario; the settings thereof, the manner in which sexual autonomy is violated; and finally, the matter of proper criminal labeling. It will conclude that while sexual autonomy is indeed under attack in cyberspace, the framework of rape is unsuitable to handle this form of offensiveness."

Vygotskian constructionism has provided the theoretical framework for the investigation. The wide availability of social media and their high penetration rate are seen as key advantages. The stress has been put on the fact that such platforms enable users to interact with others and acquire the target language in their own community of practice. The learning process, thus, gets enriched by both individual and collaborative dimensions. Negotiation of meaning, as well as the autonomy in creating one’s new identity and customizing the study content, become crucial aspects of the experience. Assuming accountability for one’s own learning results in increased intrinsic motivation to bridge the gap between the current level of knowledge and the desired proficiency level. Finally, certain features of social media that allow instructors to use them in class are discussed."

The corpus of this research consists of six videos available on the Facebook® page of the city council of Recife in 2014, when government agency released the slogan “Recife, Cidade das Pessoas”. The study is justified by the need of understanding how the political discourses are spread and how these discourses have no explicit assumptions. We believe that a better design of the influence of discourses, along with further clarification of social significance exercised by them, can contribute to a more democratic social life, which will be accessible to the entire population. For the present study, no theory was previously defined. The option for this construction enables the non-interference of external factors guiding the analyses. Data was analyzed without theoretical influences, so that the theoretical constructs emerged from the analysis rather than the reverse. However, the vision of authorship in relation to the concept of speech interferes with the analysis and serves as a theoretical lens through which data will be displayed. For results, two discursive formations were found: (1) the protection of the Government and (2) healthy lifestyles practices, with includes social, cultural and physical. This discursive formation is founded on the pillars of bio-politics and sustainability, quality of life and social change. It was noticed that the program has a goal it is to influence people’s opinions about public spaces and mobility in a municipality."

Pieters \n Peter M. T. Zaal \nAbstract On long-duration space missions, skill retention and generalizability become ever more important as mission length increases, for it is through these capabilities that astronaut crews achieve autonomy. Because simulators are used extensively in all types of training, the effects of simulator fidelity on skill retention and generalizability are paramount to understand. A literature survey was performed to identify current research gaps in skill retention and generalizability. The survey identified a need for a structured and quantifiable approach to characterize skill decay, for example, using a cybernetic approach. Such an approach would allow for gaining a deeper understanding of the mechanisms through which skill decay operates. Furthermore, the literature survey identified three research gaps and opportunities for future research: (1) developing skill decay functions provides theoretical insights into skill decay and could allow for several practical applications, such as planning refresher training, (2) investigating the effects of simulator fidelity on skill decay functions could allow for better simulator utilization during training, and (3) investigating the generalizability of skills learned in initial training to other tasks could provide space crews with greater autonomy."

The following problems are discussed: influence of upbringing styles and parental attitudes on various aspects of psychological development of adolescents; contribution of relationships with parents and peers into social and personality development in adolescence; peculiarities of teenagers’ attachments to parents; child-parent conflicts. The recent studies of family education and its influence on psychological development confirm the positive role of authoritative parenting style, the negative impact of rigid parenting style on adolescent aggression and so on. It is shown that excessive parental control does not contribute to the development of self-esteem and increases self-criticism in adolescent girls. In relatively new researches devoted to “technoference” the negative impact of technical means (phone, gadgets) on interaction between parents and children is shown. The article stresses the importance of attachment to parents in adolescence; the role of the quality of attachment in formation of autonomy; capacity to solve problems and cope with difficulties associated with Internet addiction; aggression and school performance. The article also presents studies of positive and negative aspects of the impact of conflict with parents on the personality development of adolescents, gender differences in behavior during the conflict between mother and father, the contribution of marital conflicts to psychological development in adolescence."

Based on an 18-month digital ethnography that combines direct observation, digital interactions on YouTube channels, and other social media and semistructured interviews with 17 Spanish-speaking BookTubers, this study uses Pierre Bourdieu’s concepts of field and capital to analyze how BookTubers negotiate their practices with other agents of the publishing world. This article characterizes the challenges the Spanish-language publishing industry is facing in the context of digitalization to attract readers; describes the position that BookTubers have within the YouTube ecosystem, and how they relate with the platform’s actors, politics, and affordances; and analyzes the exchanges that BookTubers establish with publishers—often referred as collaborations—and their implications for their autonomy. This case study helps to understand how platformization allows new agents to transfer capital gained in social media to other cultural industries."

Research on how firms’ attempts to intervene in such forums affect customers’ experience supremacy is still in its infancy. This study attempts to address this limitation, suggesting a framework for understanding firms’ impact on customer experience in customer-owned forums. Towards this aim, we adopt self-determination theory as a theoretical lens, and, empirically draw on interview material gleaned from customer-owned touch point users. The results show that companies’ attempt to control the discussions in such forums may have a negative impact on customers’ experiences when it undermines their sense of autonomy, relatedness, and competence. However, firms’ intervention is welcome when the intention is to add value, enabling customers to retain or enhance their feeling of self-efficacy and social esteem."

Герасименко \nOver the past decade, the issue of uncontrolled growth of unsystematic information in Internet has remained acute for the scientific community. The problem of finding relevant information related to the distribution and autonomy of scientific information resources remains. A priority in the field of centralized access to the key scientifically significant sources of information is the creation of a united information space (UIS). The study aims to identify the main models to form systems integrating distributed information resources, and as a result to determine the structure of UIS formation in a research library. Two models were considered and analyzed in the study: a meta-aggregator and an integrated electronic library. During the analysis, elements, structure and a set of functions for users and employees of a research library are revealed for each model. The study allowed the drawing of the following conclusions: • The choice of a model for the UIS formation depends mostly on the formulation of tasks, the solution of which is the purpose of creating a system, as well as on the technological potential of the organizations involved in the process. •Multifunctionality of the system allows simultaneous use of the above-mentioned formation models. • Adding the element of interactivity to the structure of UIS of the research library will allow timely monitoring of changes in the information needs of scientists, reduction of time, labor and financial costs of both the library and a user. The article presents the criteria for choosing a model. For the first time the optimal effective structure of the UIS in the research library is described."

Self-determination theory suggests that such feelings are attributable to antagonistic situations hindering the satisfaction of an individual’s basic needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) is a phenomenon that arose in the context of social media use and refers to the need to stay continually connected. Studies have shown that problematic social media and mobile technology use are related to feelings of anxiety, depression, and loneliness, and FOMO. Few studies have examined the relationships between these factors and academic performance. This study examines how Loneliness, FOMO, and the basic needs Autonomy, Competence, and Relatedness, are related to Academic Performance. We find a positive influence of FOMO and a negative influence of Autonomy on Academic Performance. We discuss these and other findings."

Aerial spraying of products to kill larvae or adult mosquitoes is a public health measure used to control vector-borne diseases. In some outbreaks, the intervention has evoked controversy and community resistance. This study evaluated how local opinion leaders in US localities affected by Zika think about community engagement in public health policies for outbreak response. In December 2017 through March 2018, 4 focus groups were convened in Houston, TX, New Orleans, LA, Miami, FL, and Brooklyn, NY. They discussed a hypothetical scenario that featured vector control by aerial spraying. Participants (N = 20) more readily accepted this vector control method under 4 conditions: They were informed of alternatives, benefits, and risks for human health and the environment. Public health claims were backed by objective evidence and an authority figure genuinely working in the community’s interests. They received timely notice about how to mitigate toxin exposure. And, aerial spraying helped to protect vulnerable individuals. The community engagement requirements of the local opinion leaders resonate with core principles of recent public health ethics frameworks: namely, personal autonomy, transparency, reasonableness, and solidarity. Participants foresaw problems with community consent in an era of growing social media use and mistrust in governmental and scientific authority. They also debated whether health authorities should use moral-based arguments, in addition to science-based ones, to communicate aerial spraying’s risks and benefits."

Konstantinidis \nAs a result of several years of European funding, progressive introduction of assistive technologies in our society has provided many researchers and companies with opportunities to develop new information and communication technologies aimed at overcoming the digital divide of those at a greater risk of being left behind, as can be the case with healthy older people and those developing cognitive decline and dementia. Moreover, in recent years, when considering how information and communication technologies have been integrated into older people’s lives, and how technology has influenced these individuals, doubts remain regarding whether technologies really fulfil older users’ needs and wishes and whether technologies developed specifically for older users necessarily protect and consider main ethical values. In this article, we address the relevance of privacy, vulnerability and preservation of autonomy as key factors when involving older individuals as target users for information and communication technology research and development. We provide explanatory examples on ethical issues involved in the particular case of developing different types of information and communication technology for older people (from robotics to serious games), what previously performed research tells us about older adults’ preferences and wishes for information and communication technology and what steps should be taken into consideration in the near future."

Few studies have investigated the relationship between BA and early maladaptive schemas (EMSs). EMS is the core of Schema Therapy (ST). According to the ST model, psychiatric disorders result from the developmentof EMSs in response to unmet emotional needs in childhood. Bach and colleagues (2018) grouped the 18 EMSs in four domains: 1) disconnection and rejection; 2) impaired autonomy and performance; 3) excessive responsibility and standards; and 4) impaired limits. This study aims at assessing the possible association of the most frequent BAs with EMSs in a large group of late adolescents and young adults and to evaluate their self-perceived quality of life. Methods: A battery of psychological tests assessing food addiction (FA), gambling disorder (GD), internet addiction (IA) and quality of life (QoL) was administered to 1,075 late adolescents and young adults (N=637; 59.3% women). A forward-stepwise logistic regression model was run to identify which variables were associated with behavioral addictions. Results: FA was more frequent among women and GD among men, while IA was equally distributed. Regarding the EMSs, participants with FA or IA showed significantly higher scores on all four-schema domains, whereas those with GD exhibited higher scores on impaired autonomy and performance and impaired limits. Besides, average scores of all domains increased with the association of 2 or more comorbid BAs. Self-perceived QoL was lower for participants with FA and IA, but not for those with GD; the presence of comorbid BAs was associated to lower PCS and MCS scores. Finally, specific EMS domains and demographic variables were associated with each BA. Conclusions: Late adolescents and young adults with FA or IA have a lower perception of their mental and physical health. The most striking result is that FA appears to be associated with the disconnection and rejection schema domain, IA with all the schema domains (except for impaired autonomy and performance), and GD with impaired autonomy and performance schema domain. In conclusion, our findings suggest that EMS should be systematically assessed during psychotherapy of patients with BAs."

Cox \nThis essay maps IBM’s attempts to construct a typology of high-tech ‘New Collar’ work and leverage policymaking outcomes to underwrite IBM corporate ventures capable of materializing this work. Through a discursive analysis of IBM corporate texts, webpages, and the 2017 New Collar Jobs Act, I argue for New Collar work to be understood through the lens of autonomy, as IBM recasts notions of ‘autonomous’ technology onto humans by downplaying dystopic associations of technological autonomy and transferring notions of autonomy to human workers. In doing so, I account for IBM’s use of ‘augmentation’ to situate human intelligence as the cognitive force uplifted by work performed with artificial intelligence. By pairing human augmentation with posthumanist conceptions of ‘distributed cognition’, IBM centers human intelligence through a redistributed cognition that reverses posthumanism’s decentering of human supremacy. Following from this, I unpack ‘New Collar’ as a reinvention of ‘white’ and ‘blue’ collar dichotomies and New Collar work as the grounds for tech workers to reinvent themselves. In this way, by minimizing the necessity of 4-year college degrees as pathways to economic and professional mobility, IBM constructs ‘New Collar’ with embedded notions of enlarged self-determination for applied worker intellect, vocational training, and employability. Under the aegis of creating, training, and employing New Collar workers, IBM pursues policy outcomes to underwrite corporate ventures related to New Collar work and bolster its institutional autonomy amidst marketplaces of cognitive capitalism. By outlining how tax relief provisions of the New Collar Jobs Act correlate with neoliberal ideologies of legislators and IBM investments in public–private vocational models and cybersecurity platforms, I account for IBM’s elongated ‘economy of learning’ that enables the company to more thoroughly capture, underwrite, and commodify New Collar cognition from training to market outputs."

A moderated mediation model \nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2020.106319\n Shun Peng \n Bingping Zhou \n Xia Wang \n Hongpo Zhang \n Xiangen Hu \nThe Interaction of Person-Affect-Cognition-Execution model (I-PACE; Brand, Young, Laier, Wolfling, & Potenza, 2016) proposes that addictive behavior is the result of the interaction of multiple factors. According to I-PACE model, perceived social support (teacher autonomy support), self-esteem, and gratification (life satisfaction) contribute to adolescent smartphone use disorder (SUD) (Brand et al., 2016). However, previous studies have rarely examined the interactive effects of teacher autonomy support, self-esteem and life satisfaction on adolescent SUD. The present study examined these relationships using a moderated mediation model in which self-esteem played a mediating role and life satisfaction played a moderating role in the relation between teacher autonomy support and adolescent SUD. A sample of 1912 Chinese adolescents completed measures of teacher autonomy support, self-esteem, life satisfaction, and adolescent SUD. Self-esteem mediated the association between teacher autonomy support and adolescent SUD. In addition, the relation between teacher autonomy support and SUD was moderated by life satisfaction: when the effect of life satisfaction was high, teacher autonomy support negatively predicted adolescent SUD, whereas when the effect of life satisfaction was low, teacher autonomy support was positively related to adolescent SUD. These findings advance our understanding of the effect of teacher autonomy support, self-esteem and life satisfaction on adolescent SUD. Limitations and implications of this study are discussed, such as teacher autonomy support may not reduce adolescent SUD, especially when their life satisfaction is low."

The external control has changed to the flexible management of self-control, and the increase of job autonomy has become a trend. Job autonomy refers to the discretion of an organization to allow employees to complete tasks when, where, in what order and in what manner. In the past, the mainstream theoretical models and empirical studies have found that the job autonomy has a positive impact on employees. But currently the new research has found that the excessive job autonomy can have a negative impact on employees, and there is a “too-much-of-a-good-thing” effect. This article mainly expounds the “too-much-of-a-good-thing” effect of the job autonomy, and then, explains the effect by the two types mechanisms, “additive benefit and cost” and “interactive motivation and opportunity”. Finally, this article puts forward some issues that should be paid attention to future researches."

It also includes the knowledge of how native speakers of one language use the language in the context of structures of interpersonal exchange in which many factors interact. In this study, autonomy was implemented by journal or diary writing, sharing and discussing journals, sharing feedback on journals, reflection, promoting dictionary use, introducing useful internet websites, forming yahoo groups, sharing valuable links, creating online self-access center, watching preferable movies, and goal setting. The present quasi-experimental study aimed to investigate the impact of teaching autonomy on the speaking skill of Iranian EFL learners. To this end, 44 male and female intermediate students at Respina Talk (i.e., Iran-Canada) language school with the age range of 20-35 were selected in order to achieve the objectives of the study.

Groen \nAbstract Previous research on the relationship between students’ home and school Information and Communication Technology (ICT) resources and academic performance has shown ambiguous results. The availability of ICT resources at school has been found to be unrelated or negatively related to academic performance, whereas the availability of ICT resources at home has been found to be both positively and negatively related to academic performance. In addition, the frequency of use of ICT is related to students’ academic achievement. This relationship has been found to be negative for ICT use at school, however, for ICT use at home the literature on the relationship with academic performance is again ambiguous. In addition to ICT availability and ICT use, students’ attitudes towards ICT have also been found to play a role in student performance. In the present study, we examine how availability of ICT resources, students’ use of those resources (at school, outside school for schoolwork, outside school for leisure), and students’ attitudes toward ICT (interest in ICT, perceived ICT competence, perceived ICT autonomy) relate to individual differences in performance on a digital assessment of reading in one comprehensive model using the Dutch PISA 2015 sample of 5183 15-year-olds (49.2% male). Student gender and students’ economic, social, and cultural status accounted for a substantial part of the variation in digitally assessed reading performance. Controlling for these relationships, results indicated that students with moderate access to ICT resources, moderate use of ICT at school or outside school for schoolwork, and moderate interest in ICT had the highest digitally assessed reading performance. In contrast, students who reported moderate competence in ICT had the lowest digitally assessed reading performance. In addition, frequent use of ICT outside school for leisure was negatively related to digitally assessed reading performance, whereas perceived autonomy was positively related. Taken together, the findings suggest that excessive access to ICT resources, excessive use of ICT, and excessive interest in ICT is associated with lower digitally assessed reading performance."

The selected works and websites all address readers who suffer from depression, anxiety and stress. The article focuses on how the relationship between fate and freedom is represented in three literary figures: the reader, who is promised recovery; the narrator, who promises to save the reader from the mental illnesses; and the plot that the reader forms by his or her personal thoughts, feelings and experiences. Furthermore, fate and freedom will be analysed in a series of allegories and metaphors. We argue that each literary figure reflects a radical understanding of individual autonomy, that is, freedom of action. However, we also argue that each literary figure has a shadowy disadvantage, which activates a tragic reversal of fate. The article analyses how this self-help genre reflects a notion of tragedy in relation to mental suffering."

Đukanović \nDespite the troubling data that points to population imbalance, more precisely, increased number of born males in many countries, the issue of sex selection for non-medical reasons was not addressed adequately from the human rights protection perspective. Sex selection is also complex ethical issue. One of the most common arguments used in favor of non-medical sex selection, is that the ban of sex selection will simply limit reproductive freedom. Many supporters of non-medical sex selection defend the practice by relying on the reason of ‘family balancing’. However, this reason does not seem to be eligible to justify selection. Problem of reproductive tourism is also present, due to the different approaches of the countries in regulating non-medical sex selection. More precisely, people are traveling to countries where respect for individual autonomy plays dominant role. In addition, there is a simple option to send samples for analysis to companies that advertise genetic testing over internet. In the context of human rights protection, only the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine has ban on sex selection for non-medical purposes, however, this ban applies only to specific, less practiced technique of selection. When it comes to other techniques of selection, Article 5 (a) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women might be helpful to some extent. The issue of non-medical sex selection was in the focus of interest of the United Nations, Council of Europe and European Union to some extent, however insufficiently."

The purpose of both research studies was to identify the shortcomings of different approaches to ensuring cyclist safety, evaluate the adequacy of planned solutions and propose some improvements of preventive actions taken by various stakeholders.\nDesign/Methods/Approach:\nA field survey was conducted among the residents of the City Municipality of Celje (n = 171) on their satisfaction with cyclist safety, while an online survey was carried out among internet users (n = 210) on the usefulness of an alternative approach to raise cyclists’ awareness by digitising cycling routes and safety risks.\nFindings:\nResults show that respondents are generally not satisfied with cyclist safety, as most believe that municipal efforts are insufficient to ensure it. It was observed that cycling infrastructure needs to be properly regulated and that a positive traffic culture should be promoted at the municipal level, including through the promotion of preventive activities. Both internet users and local residents recognise a strong need to digitise cycle paths by indicating safety risks. Therefore, it would be reasonable to upgrade conventional approaches to raising public awareness by introducing solutions that are useful for cyclists.\nResearch Limitations / Implications:\nThe limitation of the research study arises from the fact that its results cannot be generalised to all municipalities, since they apply different approaches to ensuring cyclist safety due to their autonomy and are facing different safety risks. Moreover, due to the use of a non-random sample, caution is necessary when generalising research results.\nPractical Implications:\nThe results of the presented studies are primarily useful to decision-makers and infrastructure managers at national and local level when planning changes and safety measures in the field of cyclist safety.\nOriginality/Value:\nThe paper encompasses two studies, the findings of which complement one another substantially and provide a deeper insight into the issues of cyclist safety and preventive actions taken by different stakeholders. They serve as a basis for further exploring this issue in different local environments with a view of obtaining a more comprehensive insight into the key challenges of traffic safety from a broader perspective."

It explores the dichotomous foundation of Facebook’s choice architecture in which users are given an apparent sense of autonomy while the platform implicitly soft-controls them. This paradoxical power plays functions through two broad types of nudges—activity-inducing nudges and passivity-inducing nudges. The mechanism of functioning of these nudges on Facebook is explored while noting the behavioural patterns they induce among users. Facebook’s transition from information architecture to choice architecture is also explored. Thus, the article aims to contribute to the growing body of work, which has underscored the importance of assessing web 2.0 as the ‘technological unconscious’ which has penetrated everyday life."

The study was based on data from an international survey, Health Behaviour in School Aged Children (HBSC), conducted in Slovakia. The sample representative for adolescents included 2547 participants (51% boys) aged 13–15. Multiple-step linear regression revealed that higher parental care and parental monitoring predicted lower EIU, while higher parental overprotection and lower socioeconomic status predicted higher EIU. The results suggest that both so-called optimal parenting (i.e., the balance of emotional warmth and protection) and the adolescent′s autonomy lower the risk of EIU. Family factors explained about 14% of the variance, which suggests that aside from personal, cognitive and affective factors, a close social environment also plays an important role in adolescence EIU."

Its objective is to understand the relationship between students, parents, and teachers when using the digital platform, as well as to verify how each one of them appropriates the technological tool. Reflection is based on the premise that the accelerated pace of technological innovation requires that people increasingly assimilate their potential not only in the business field but also in the scholar communities. More than presenting concepts and theories on ICT (KERCKHOVE, 1995, MACHADO, 2004; VEEN, VRAKKING, 2009; MORAN, 2015, and others), the article carries out an empirical research exercise in which the authors conduct observations to the digital platform of a private school in the city of Taquara (Brazil), besides applying a questionnaire with three parents, three students and one teacher of a 4th-grade class in the same school. This research aims to understand if the classes are more attractive, interactive, collaborative and, especially if there is a greater engagement of parents, students and the teacher due to the possibility of digital connections between them. In short, the results pointed out that the digital platform encourages practices with active methodologies in and outside the classroom (at home). In the universe researched, it was also identified that interactions with digital media encourage student autonomy, but parents could use it to become more involved in the process of learning with their children."

We use data collected via an online questionnaire (using the Google Forms platform) from 97 employees working in the ICT sector in Serbia. The data was collected between February and June 2019. The analysis shows that job design is a predictor of both job satisfaction and organisational commitment. Of the five investigated job dimensions (Skill variety, Task identity, Task significance, Autonomy, Feedback from job), ?Autonomy? was the most positively associated with job satisfaction (r=0.629) but was only moderately associated with organisational commitment (r=0.4). The other job dimensions were found to be weakly correlated with the investigated work attitudes, although the relationships were positive. Furthermore, the results indicate that work engagement mediates both investigated relationships, providing a deeper insight into how job design is translated into positive work-related attitudes. We discuss the possible managerial implications of the ?Autonomy? dimension and the interventions in work engagement required to positively influence work-related attitude formation and management in the ICT sector, and we distinguish between ?bottom-up? and ?top-down? interventions."

However, many patients with serious mental illnesses (eg, schizophrenia) have not been offered the digital health training necessary to fully utilize these innovative approaches. To bridge this digital divide in knowledge and skills, we created a hands-on and interactive training program grounded in self-determination theory, technology use cases, and the therapeutic alliance. This article introduces the need and theoretical foundation for and the experience of running the resulting Digital Opportunities for Outcomes in Recovery Services (DOORS) group in the setting of 2 programs: a first-episode psychosis program and a clubhouse for individuals with serious mental illness. The experience of running these 2 DOORS groups resulted in 2 publicly available, free training manuals to empower others to run such groups and adapt them for local needs. Future work on DOORS will expand the curriculum to best support digital health needs and increase equity of access to and knowledge and skills related to technology use in serious mental illness."

    "text": "Doc 1160 :  Application of Mobile Phone as a Motivational Tool in the ESP Classrooms of Dhofar University \nhttps://doi.org/10.36892/ijlls.v2i1.116\n Thomas Baby Kappalumakkel \nThe present paper investigated the factors of motivation and the role of teachers in motivating English language learners in the ESP classes of Dhofar University as well as the significance of motivation in teaching and learning through mobile application technology. Mobile phones are handy devices that are readily available with all the students in universities and colleges nowadays. Furthermore, the innovative use of mobile applications and internet technology is very common among the undergraduate students. This paper is a detailed description of some of the teaching strategies employed through mobile phones to motivate the students who have very low level of motivation. Since lack of motivation among students is a common challenge faced by most of the ELT teachers in their classrooms, practical solutions centred on mobile applications is the focus of this study. Furthermore, supplementing classroom practices with mobile application technology can promote learner autonomy and peer learning opportunities within the classroom resulting in a visible rise in the motivational graph of the whole class. This paper is also a practical account of how mobile applications can be integrated into classroom teaching without affecting the traditional syllabus of a conventional university curriculum."

Our regression analysis is based on a production function framework and exploits fine-grained firm survey data on ICT use and organisational practices for 1,045 service firms in Germany. We find empirical support for the argument that the returns to mobile ICT are higher when TBW allows for discretion over when, where and how to perform work-related tasks. The finding holds when we account for more limited forms of workplace flexibility, suggesting that the high degree of formal employee autonomy under TBW drives the complementarity between mobile ICT and organisational practices."

Peschl \nIn our increasingly digital societies, many companies have business models that perceive users’ (or customers’) personal data as a siloed resource, owned and controlled by the data controller rather than the data subjects. Collecting and processing such a massive amount of personal data could have many negative technical, social and economic consequences, including invading people’s privacy and autonomy. As a result, regulations such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) have tried to take steps towards a better implementation of the right to digital privacy. This paper proposes that such legal acts should be accompanied by the development of complementary technical solutions such as Cognitive Personal Assistant Systems to support people to effectively manage their personal data processing on the Internet. Considering the importance and sensitivity of personal data processing, such assistant systems should not only consider their owner’s needs and values, but also be transparent, accountable and controllable. Pluralist approaches in computational cognitive modelling of human needs and values which are not bound to traditional paradigmatic borders such as cognitivism, connectionism, or enactivism, we argue, can create a balance between practicality and usefulness, on the one hand, and transparency, accountability, and controllability, on the other, while supporting and empowering humans in the digital world. Considering the threat to digital privacy as significant to contemporary democracies, the future implementation of such pluralist models could contribute to power-balance, fairness and inclusion in our societies."

Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from participating patients (n = 8) and occupational therapists (n = 7) from three rehabilitation clinics in Sweden. The intervention consisted of delivering the interactive digital calendar RemindMe, receiving an individualized introduction, a written manual, and individual weekly conversations for two months with follow-up assessments after two and four months. Feasibility areas of acceptability, demand, implementation, practicality, and integration were examined. Patients expressed their interest and intention to use RemindMe and reported a need for reminders and individualized support. By using reminders in activities in everyday life their autonomy was supported. The study also demonstrated the importance of confirming reminders and the possible role of habit-forming. Occupational therapists perceived the intervention to be useful at the rehabilitation clinics and the weekly support conversations enabled successful implementation. This study confirmed the importance of basing and tailoring the intervention to patients’ needs and thus being person-centered."

That concept is still very interesting for rethinking production, consumption and education parameters in our society, as it defends that communities must be more autonomous from institutions. Authors such as Manzini and Thackara have recently brought these ideas back. Conviviality has been associated to sustainability, since it reduces the demand for material goods. It is possible to develop decentralised systems for learning and teaching, with internet and social media. And it is possible to create objects in a more autonomous way, sothat people can have an active part. This paper investigates conviviality in education and design and presents the examples of convivial learning and creationthat happened at a University Design course, and at bamboo design workshops and a clothes refashioning event."

Johnson \n Allison Eden \n Leonard Reinecke \n Tilo Hartmann \nThe relationship between self-control and media use is complicated. Loss of self-control capacity has been linked to generally higher levels of media use, which might represent self-regulatory failure, but could also be attempts at replenishing self-control. Indeed, self-determination theory proposes that satisfying intrinsic psychological needs (autonomy, competence, and relatedness), for example via media use, aids the recovery of self-control. In this 2-wave survey (N = 395), we examined the interplay of users’ self-control capacity and their perceived satisfaction of autonomy, competence, and relatedness needs via media use and alternative leisure activities. Satisfaction of intrinsic needs during leisure activities increased self-control capacity at the end of the evening. Feelings of autonomy and competence during TV and social media use, and competence during socializing, positively contributed to greater self-control. However, respondents with less self-control capacity before primetime experienced less intrinsic need satisfaction while engaged with TV, social media, reading, sports, and socializing, diminishing self-control at bedtime.

Design/methodology/approach This study was carried out using a qualitative approach assessing program activities and client satisfaction. It focused on program activity, target and implementation effectively and efficiently, involving the client’s evaluation process. Research data was obtained from the Papua Regional Development Planning Agency and separated into primary and secondary sources. Primary data was obtained through observation, interview and documentation from several informants. The informants were determined based on the role and involvement in the Papua Province Special Autonomy. Secondary data sources were obtained through field studies, scientific journals, previous research, written documents from relevant agencies, internet and electronic and print media. Findings This study exhibits characteristics of Papua Province Special Autonomy, which are identical to an asymmetric decentralization model, although it took 20 years of implementation because of the lack of evaluation and improvement. It disproves Katorobo’s (2004) theory that the said asymmetric decentralization model is more effective than symmetrical decentralization. Material requirement planning (MRP) empowerment or abolition should be considered important because of the lack of positive results. Otsus needs to improve the system and financial management, considering financial distribution for developed regions in the coastal areas and plains rather than mountainous regions. Originality/value This research was conducted because of the phenomenon of Papua Province Special Autonomy, also driven by the problems in the implementation of Special Autonomy Policy for Papua Province that had not borne optimum results. This study aimed to make recommendations for the Special Autonomy policy of the Papua Province to improve community welfare."

Puaschunder \nThe introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in our contemporary society imposes historically unique challenges for humankind. The emerging autonomy of AI holds unique potentials of eternal life of robots, AI and algorithms alongside unprecedented economic superiority, data storage and computational advantages. Yet to this day, it remains unclear what impact AI taking over the workforce will have on economic growth. This paper therefore first establishes what AI is and provides a theoretical background on standard neoclassical and heterodox economics growth theories with particular attention to the Cambridge Capital Controversy’s argument to divide capital components into fluid, hence more flexible (e.g., petty cash, checking account), and more clay, hence more inflexible (e.g., factories and intransferable means of production), components. The contemporary trend of slowbalisation is described, as the slowing down of conventional globalization of goods, services and Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) flows; yet at the same time, we still see human migration and air travel as well as data transfer continuing to rise. These market trends of conventional globalization slowing and rising AI-related industries are proposed as first market disruption in the wake of the large-scale entrance of AI into our contemporary economy. Growth in the artificial age is then proposed to be measured based on two AI entrance proxies of Global Connectivity Index and The State of the Mobile Internet Connectivity 2018 Index, which is found to be highly significantly positively correlated with the total inflow of migrants and FDI inflow – serving as evidence that the still globalizing rising industries in the age of slowbalisation are connected to AI. Both indices are positively correlated with GDP output in cross-sectional studies over the world. In order to clarify if the found effect is a sign of industrialization, time series of worldwide data reveal that internet connectivity around the world is associated with lower economic growth from around 2000 on until 2017. A regression plotting Internet Connectivity and GDP per capita as independent variables to explain the dependent variable GDP growth outlines that the effect for AI is a significant determinant of negative GDP growth prospects for the years from 2000 until 2017. A panel regression plotting GDP per capita and internet connectivity from the year 2000 to explain economic growth consolidates the finding that AI-internet connectivity is a significant determinant of negative growth over time for 161 countries of the world. Internet connectivity is associated with economic growth decline whereas GDP per capita has no significant relation with GDP growth. To cross-validate both findings hold for two different global connectivity measurements. The paper then discusses a theoretical argument of dividing labor components into fluid, hence more flexible (e.g., AI), and more clay, hence more inflexible (e.g., human labor), components. The paper ends on a call for revising growth theories and integrating AI components into growth theory. AI entrance into economic markets is modeled into the standard neoclassical growth theory by creating a novel index for representing growth in the artificial age comprised of GDP per capita and AI entrance measured by the proxy of Internet Access percent per country. Maps reveal the parts of the world that feature high GDP per capita and AI-connectivity. The discussion closes with a future outlook on the law and economics of AI entrance into our contemporary economies and society in order to aid a successful and humane introduction of AI into our world."

    "text": "Doc 1170 :  Is open source software the New Lex Mercatoria \n\n Fabrizio Marrella \n Christopher S. Yoo \nEarly Internet scholars proclaimed that the transnational nature of the Internet rendered it inherently unregulable by conventional governments. Instead, the Internet would be governed by customs and practices established by the end user community in a manner reminiscent of the lex mercatoria, which spontaneously emerged during medieval times to resolve international trade disputes independently and autonomously from national law. Subsequent events have revealed these claims to have been overly optimistic, as national governments have evinced both the inclination and the ability to exert influence, if not outright control, over the physical infrastructure, the domain name system, and the content flowing across the network. These failures have done little to lessen the allure of Internet self-governance. In particular, some scholars have suggested that more widespread use of open source software would increase the Internet’s ability to resist governmental control. This Essay explores whether more widespread use of open source software might provide the basis for the type of bottom-up ordering associated with the lex mercatoria. Perhaps unsurprisingly, a system of self-governance based on open source implicates the same questions of spontaneity, universality, and autonomy that surround the lex mercatoria."

Our gamification approach was based on the self-determination theory. According to this theory, people need to have competence, social connectedness, and autonomy in order to feel determined to perform certain activities. We aimed to investigate the effects of teaching presence in online gamification on sustainability learning and self-determination as well as identify the driving factors and barriers to sustaining students’ participation in online gamified activity. A mobile application called JouleBug was used. It contains game elements and aims to encourage pro-environmental behaviours. Our quasi-experimental design included two university courses (as control and treatment groups) on sustainable education with 48 participants. Both groups worked with JouleBug, whereas the treatment group was also supported by their teacher’s teaching presence. To establish online teaching presence, the teacher shares the students’ leader board rankings, acknowledges the students’ achievements, and give comments and feedback on students’ activities in the chatting group twice a week. Sustainability knowledge and pro-environmental behaviour were measured through survey. Students’ performance in the gamified activities was measured through collected points in the JouleBug application. The drivers and barriers to sustaining the students’ participation in JouleBug activities were identified through focus group interviews and students’ reflection writing. We found there were significant differences in the sustainability knowledge, pro-environmental behaviour, and performance between the treatment and control groups. The Cohen’s d effect size value obtained for the treatment on sustainability knowledge, pro-environmental behaviour, and students’ performance indicates a large effect as well. Focus group interviews with the participants and the students’ reflection writings revealed that the driving factors in sustaining the participation in the gamified activities in the application are recognition by teachers and peers, competition, and sense of belonging to a group. Meanwhile, the barriers to sustaining participation in online gamification are time constraints, boredom caused by lack of social interaction, and boredom caused by activity repetition and activity’s inappropriate level of difficulty. The conclusion is the teacher plays a role as an agent in this online gamification learning context. The findings suggest that teaching presence is one of the important building blocks that encourage the students’ participation and learning in online gamification."

However, to grow, the baby requires initially that is established a narrow dependence between him and his/her parents, so that, in the second time, he can take his autonomy. With through its experiment clinical and a review of a certain number of media messages, the author shows how much certain adults are in lack of reference, which prevents them from correctly transmitting the limits essential to child education.

Artificial intelligence as a future technology is actively expanding its capabilities at the present stage of development of society. In this regard, the concept of ‘artificial intelligence’ and the application of the rule of right in resolving issues of legal responsibility for the operation of artificial intelligence technologies require definition. The main purpose of this study is to define the concept of ‘artificial intelligence’ and determine whether artificial intelligence technologies are the object or subject of right. The article provides the analysis of possible approaches to the disclosure of the concept of ‘artificial intelligence’ as a legal category and its relationship with the concepts of ‘robot’ and ‘cyberphysical system’. The issues of legal responsibility for the operation of artificial intelligence are revealed. For the purposes hereof, the methods of collecting and studying the singularities; generalizations; the methods of scientific abstraction; the methods of cognition of consistent patterns, as well as the method of objectivity, concreteness, pluralism and a whole range of other methods were used. The study has concluded that the artificial intelligence technology is an autonomous self-organizing computer-software or cyberphysical system with the ability and capability to think, learn, make decisions independently, perceive and model surrounding images and symbols, relationships, processes and implement its own decisions. The following general properties of artificial intelligence technologies have been defined: autonomy; the ability to perceive the conditions (situation), make and implement own decisions; the ability to adapt own behavior, to learn, to communicate with other artificial intelligence, to consider, accumulate and reproduce experience (including human experience). Within the present historical period, artificial intelligence technology should be considered as the object of right. The legal responsibility for the operation of artificial intelligence lies with the operator or another person who sets the parameters of its operation and controls its behavior. The creator (manufacturer) of artificial intelligence is also recognized as a responsible person. This conclusion makes it possible to enter the category of artificial intelligence in the legal field and determine the persons responsible for its poor-quality operation."

Drawing from a variety of qualitative data, this analysis finds that (1) the decentralized structure of Mastodon enables community autonomy, (2) Mastodon’s open-source protocol allows the internal and technical development of the site to become a social enterprise in and of itself, and (3) Mastodon’s horizontal structure shifts the site’s scaling focus from sheer number of users to quality engagement and niche communities. To this end, Mastodon helps us rethink “the social” in social media in terms of topology, abstraction, and scale."

In Malaysia, instructors and students are gradually adopting the e-learning or blended-learning approach by using online discussion forums (e.g. BlackBoard) or social networking sites (e.g. Facebook groups) to engage students’ participation in courses and encourage self-directed learning. This study presents a qualitative view of students’ perception of engaging in online discussion forums in a synchronous learning environment, and their views on the positive and negative aspects of using online discussion forums for learning. Results indicate that students perceive autonomy and sense of belongingness in the online community as main factors that influence their voluntary and active participation in the online discussion forums. Technical challenges remain as a key factor in determining students’ interests to utilize online discussion forums for learning. While future research is needed to assess the sentiments of Malaysian students in online learning, this study was intended to provide Malaysian instructors and higher education institutions a preview on the sentiments of students towards online learning to better improve the aspects of technical, pedagogical methods and policies for online learning as the nation moves towards Education 4.0."

Data collected using qualitative research methods by implementing convenience sampling methods. A total of six students were involved in the interview session. The findings of the research suggested that the informants agreed the most common concept of patriotism are pride and love towards the country and individualism has connection with freedom of speech, autonomy and uniqueness. The spreading and sharing of global values that fought personal rights more important than the right of the community through the internet and the social media caused the erosion of patriotism in modern society but not necessary give impact to their patriotic values. Freedom to respond, use and commenting in social media including sensitive issues like race and religion give new challenges to the unity of the Malaysian people. Therefore, existence of the patriotism is an important medium in defending a country with its own identity."

The article is based on the structural and functional, socio-cultural, cultural and historical, and comparative approaches. It is argued that the processes of economization and informatization of relations overlap each other, causing a cumulative effect and reinforcing the negative side of the globalization. This exacerbates the anthropological crisis and causes a number of structural transformations in different spheres of social life: economy, science, education, politics, public administration, etc., by changing their social status towards asociality. Under these conditions, information and knowledge are used as tools to promote the ideology of neoliberalism, which is accompanied by the destruction of the principle of individual autonomy, and thus, leads to the deliberalization of society. Information and communication technologies themselves are becoming the means for the emergence of the new netocratic cyber-elite."

This paper mainly focuses on the desktop films with the theoretical framework of “Media Ecology”, aiming to investigate how the desktop film evolves and interacts with new media, digital technology, while influencing communication and spectatorship. Firstly, this paper discusses the evolution of cinema, which evolves through the interaction, co-existence and convergence with other media, as well as corresponds to the anthropotropic trend. Secondly, this paper investigates the digital media and technology in desktop films. “Desktop films” create cyberspaces and reproduce people’s virtual lives, revealing the influences of media technology, which is considered as a double-edged sword. Thirdly, this paper analyzes how desktop film exerts impacts on cinematic communication, while reshaping the spectatorship and audience’s viewing mechanism. “Desktop films” are suitable to be watched on computer, thus making audiences become active and have more autonomy."

    "text": "Doc 1179 :  From the Ground Up: Establishing a Centre for Universal Design in Australia. \nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30371404/\n Jane Bringolf \nThe universal design movement arrived in Australia well before the turn of the century. A handful of individuals, often working as lone voices, are doing their best to incorporate the concepts into their everyday work and promote the concepts more widely. As is often the case elsewhere, the term “universal design” is misunderstood and confused with special and separate designs for people with disability rather than inclusion for everyone. Compliance to legislated disability access standards has created further confusion and as a consequence many myths about universal design have emerged. Such myths have held back the implementation and understanding of universal design and inclusive practice. Australian governments at all levels have shown little interest in promoting universal design principles, save for a casual mention of the term in policy documents. This is in spite of changes to disability and ageing policies promoting more autonomy and independence for individuals. When political leadership is absent, leadership often defaults to the community, or to be precise, to a handful of people with a passion for the cause. In 2013 a chance meeting of two unrelated individuals set the wheels in motion to establish a centre for universal design in Australia. This paper charts the development and progress of the organisation through volunteer effort, harnessing community support, maintaining international connections, using social media, and establishing a resource-rich website and newsletter."

Harvey \nPurpose : Limited research has been conducted relating to the use of social media during health and physical education teacher education. The aim of this study was to investigate preservice teachers’ perceptions of the value of using Twitter for health and physical education teacher education. Methods : Preservice teachers completed a qualitatively designed survey. Thematic analyses were conducted via Computer Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis Software, aligned to self-determination theory. Results : Twitter was perceived to be valuable for the following motivational components: (a) autonomy (choice over professional development, latest ideas, and learning flexibility), (b) relatedness (enhancing communication, tailored collaborations, and receiving practical support), and (c) competence (transferring ideas to classes, increasing technological competence, and keeping ahead of other teachers). Yet there were concerns due to Twitter’s public exposure to undesired Twitter users (relatedness) and how to navigate the platform (competence). Discussion/Conclusions : The study provides guidance to health and physical education teacher education providers on how digital learning via Twitter can meet preservice teachers’ learning needs."

It takes Schmitt’s sparse reflections about cybernetics and game theory as paradigmatic of the theoretical and political problems raised by any theory positing the autonomy of the political. It suggests that this ultimately misunderstands the role of cybernetic representations of political decision-making in shoring up in the 1960s and 1970s the autonomy of the political that Schmitt so vehemently defended."

The snowball sampling method was intentionally selected. Completed interviews were transcribed and data was reduced, analyzed, and categorized. The identified categories were 1) information comprehension, 2) decision-making in healthcare, and 3) compliance with nonpharmacologic treatment.The ‘information comprehension’ category clearly shows that the seniors involved in this study rated the comprehensibility of information provided by medical professionals as being good. An especially positive finding was that seniors do seek information through the internet, print sources, or other media, even though, as one senior (80-year-old woman) said, comprehension of medical information is becoming “more and more complex”. The ‘decision-making in healthcare’ category touched upon opinions regarding informed consent and opinions regarding seniors’ own involvement in healthcare. Results from this category suggest that seniors accept informed consent as a routine necessity. Inhibition regarding personal involvement in healthcare was also apparent: “… I come from a family accustomed to not bothering the doctor unnecessarily, so I just stick out my arm…” The last category of ‘compliance with nonpharmacologic treatment’ clearly shows that respondents are informed regarding lifestyle modifications that would benefit their treatment, although, few respondents had achieved the desired lifestyle changes.Results of this qualitative research show clear health literacy limits among seniors. As shown in this study, age itself could also be a limiting factor of health literacy."

Based on 26 interviews with journalists working in the established media in Iran, it shows that social networking websites and mobile messaging applications are arenas of mobilization and leverage for journalists in this semi-authoritarian context. Online platforms function as sources of social and symbolic assets for journalists enabling them to make others see and think about an issue, and act on it, thus employ journalistic symbolic power. This article applies Bourdieu’s concepts of doxa, social capital, symbolic capital and symbolic power to explain, why and under what circumstances certain journalistic online strategies become operative. The findings offer insights into how new media affect power relations between journalists and the forces that restrict their practices and offer potentials for relatively more journalistic autonomy in a controlled media environment."

However, there is no publication that specifically explains the role of special self-government funds to reduce poverty. Consequently, the use of accountable and transparent special autonomy funds can reduce poverty in Aceh."

Sunstein \n Ralph Hertwig \nPublic opinion is shaped in significant part by online content, spread via social media and curated algorithmically. The current online ecosystem has been designed predominantly to capture user attention rather than to promote deliberate cognition and autonomous choice; information overload, finely tuned personalization and distorted social cues, in turn, pave the way for manipulation and the spread of false information. How can transparency and autonomy be promoted instead, thus fostering the positive potential of the web? Effective web governance informed by behavioural research is critically needed to empower individuals online. We identify technologically available yet largely untapped cues that can be harnessed to indicate the epistemic quality of online content, the factors underlying algorithmic decisions and the degree of consensus in online debates. We then map out two classes of behavioural interventions-nudging and boosting- that enlist these cues to redesign online environments for informed and autonomous choice."

Larsen \n Leslee A. Fisher \n Terilyn C. Shigeno \n Matthew P. Bejar \n Melissa N. Madeson \nWhile the policies National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) athletic departments have in place regarding social media and drug abuse have been empirically investigated, research on the full battery of rules implemented by NCAA teams is scant. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze the written team rules of 41 NCAA Division I women’s basketball teams to better understand the types of rules that are in place and to hypothesize the effects these rules might have on the development of an autonomy-supportive environment. Using Consensual Qualitative Research, the research team constructed seven domains with multiple categories to represent the data. The domains included the following: (a) program expectations, (b) controlled communication, (c) controlled relationships, (d) controlled appearance/attire, (e) controlled social behavior, (f) recommendations for optimal physical performance, and (g) academic expectation. Based on the results of this study, we conclude that NCAA Division I women’s basketball coaches use team rules as a tool for domination rather than a strategy for developing the autonomy of student-athletes. We offer practical suggestions for coach educators, coach developers, and coaches on best practices when creating team rules to develop an autonomy-supportive environment that strengthens organizational loyalty and improves the experiences of student-athletes."

Huang \nPurpose This study empirically verified employee engagement (EE) as an outcome of organizational communication and confirmed that the formation of EE is strengthened when smartphone use (SU) is at a higher level. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative approach was used in this research, whereby 408 valid samples were collected with an online survey. The hypotheses of direct effects were tested using the structural equation modeling (SEM) procedure, and the moderating effects were tested using the unconstrained product indicator method and the PROCESS macro. Findings The results showed that EE was significantly influenced by person–organizationvalue fit (POVF), transformational leadership (TFL) and job autonomy (JA), and the effects of POVF and TFL were moderated significantly by SU. Although the influence of social support (SS) on EE was insignificant in the full model, SU moderated the effect of SS. The evidence also showed that work–family conflict (WFC) had no negative impact on EE. Research limitations/implications The participants of this study were restricted to a local area. Practical implications Organizations should develop job designs via two-way communication to bring up EE and SU can facilitate the process. Originality/value Previous research has identified EE as an outcome of organizational communication, but this concept has not yet been empirically verified. This research provides evidence to verify the above-mentioned concept and additionally confirms the moderating role of SU."

Nunes \nMarketers commonly seed information about products and brands through individuals believed to be influential on social media, which often involves enlisting micro influencers, users who have accumulated thousands as opposed to millions of followers (i.e., other users who have subscribed to see that individual’s posts). Given an abundance of micro influencers to choose from, cues that help distinguish more versus less effective influencers on social media are of increasing interest to marketers. The authors identify one such cue: the number of users the prospective influencer is following. Using a combination of real-world data analysis and controlled lab experiments, they show that following fewer others, conditional on having a substantial number of followers, has a positive effect on a social media user’s perceived influence. Further, the authors find greater perceived influence impacts engagement with the content shared in terms of other users exhibiting more favorable attitudes toward it (i.e., likes) and a greater propensity to spread it (i.e., retweets). They identify a theoretically important mechanism underlying the effect: following fewer others conveys greater autonomy, a signal of influence in the eyes of others."

    "text": "Doc 1191 :  Usability Heuristic Evaluation in AAL Ecosystems \nhttps://doi.org/10.18502/keg.v5i6.7050\n Carlos Romeiro \n Pedro Araújo \nIn the past few years there has been a significant growth of the elderly population in both developing and developed countries. This event provided new economic, technical and demographic challenges to current societies in several areas and services. Among them the healthcare services can be highlighted, due to its impact in people daily lives. As a natural response an effort has been made by both the scientific and industrial community to develop alternatives, which could mitigate the current healthcare services bottlenecks and provide means in aiding and improve the end-user life quality. Through a combination of information and communication technologies specialized ecosystems have been developed, however multiple challenges arose, which compromise their adoption and acceptance among the main stakeholders, such as their autonomy, robustness, security, integration, human-computer interactions and usability. As consequence an effort has been made to deal with the technical related bottlenecks, which shifted the development process focus from the end-user to the ecosystems technological impairments. Despite there being user related issues, such as usability, which still remains to be addressed. Therefore this article focuses over the ecosystem’s usability through the analysis of the process used to check the ecosystem’s compliance level with the usability guidelines from Jakob Nielsen and Shneiderman; and the identification of the quantifiable parameters for each principle that could aid in the heuristics evaluation process by maximizing its objectivity improve its overall accuracy.\n Keywords: Usability, Ambient assisted living, User interaction, Older people, Heuristics analysis"

It may offer more than improved response times and reduced latency in home and personal data services. It may reintroduce user and community control over the data lives generated by remote systems introduced by the Internet of Things. At the same time the invasive risks it presents to home and personal security and privacy may increase regulatory complexity to protect those rights. External sensing of human activity through the Smart City, home and personal IOT devices with locational data introduces many complex issues, beneficial and dangerous. These issues are resolved in a legal-technical-social milieu. Together technical and legal controls for Fog and Edge computing may mediate the data avatars we produce and protect privacy, safety personal autonomy. Those controls must be in harmony, directed towards the protection of the people, and subject to sanctions for failure to comply."

This paper aims on the use of the mobile phone not only as a source of information, but also as a didactic resource to integrate cooperative learning, self-autonomy, authenticity, creativity and critical thinking. Departing from the current governmental initiatives to implement technological tools in the English class, this work offers an integrative and innovative methodology for the English teacher in the public sector. This methodology focuses on the model of Mobile Assisted Language Learning (MALL) that intends to adjust and integrate to the available technological tools, classroom settings and students’ needs and interest."

Brown \nCyber-physical systems operate in our real world, constantly interacting with the environment and collaborating with other systems. The increasing number of devices will make it infeasible to control each one individually. It will also be infeasible to prepare each of them for every imaginable rapidly unfolding situation. Therefore, we must increase the autonomy of future Cyber-physical Systems. Making these systems self-aware allows them to reason about their own capabilities and their immediate environment. In this article, we extend the idea of the self-awareness of individual systems toward networked self-awareness . This gives systems the ability to reason about how they are being affected by the actions and interactions of others within their perceived environment, as well as in the extended environment that is beyond their direct perception. We propose that different levels of networked self-awareness can develop over time in systems as they do in humans. Furthermore, we propose that this could have the same benefits for networks of systems that it has had for communities of humans, increasing performance and adaptability."

Within this culture, mobile applications have become a common ground for the meeting between organisations and citizens interested in participating in political matters through the direct experience that these platforms allow. Despite this development, it is difficult to find a complete and reliable taxonomy of apps in the academic or professional literature that analyses how these relationships impact the field of political communication. This study tries to address this gap, introducing the first systematic taxonomy of political communication apps in Spain based on the development of a self-produced taxonomical model that gathers in detail all the variables required to understand the nature of these applications that are available for any smartphone. This rigorous taxonomy comprises political communication applications available at the main app stores (about 316 found in Play Store and App Store). Specifically, the methodological classification was elaborated based on the following categories: promoter agent, app objective, level of interaction, level of autonomy and predominant tone. A very complete picture was obtained from the empirical analysis, which defines and explains the landscape of political communication applications for mobile devices in Spain."

Bellman \n Christopher Landauer \n Nikil Dutt \n Lukas Esterle \n Andreas Herkersdorf \n Axel Jantsch \n Nima TaheriNejad \n Peter R. Lewis \n Marco Platzner \n Kalle Tammemäe \nIn this article, we make the case for the new class of Self-aware Cyber-physical Systems. By bringing together the two established fields of cyber-physical systems and self-aware computing, we aim at creating systems with strongly increased yet managed autonomy, which is a main requirement for many emerging and future applications and technologies. Self-aware cyber-physical systems are situated in a physical environment and constrained in their resources, and they understand their own state and environment and, based on that understanding, are able to make decisions autonomously at runtime in a self-explanatory way. In an attempt to lay out a research agenda, we bring up and elaborate on five key challenges for future self-aware cyber-physical systems: (i) How can we build resource-sensitive yet self-aware systems? (ii) How to acknowledge situatedness and subjectivity? (iii) What are effective infrastructures for implementing self-awareness processes? (iv) How can we verify self-aware cyber-physical systems and, in particular, which guarantees can we give? (v) What novel development processes will be required to engineer self-aware cyber-physical systems? We review each of these challenges in some detail and emphasize that addressing all of them requires the system to make a comprehensive assessment of the situation and a continual introspection of its own state to sensibly balance diverse requirements, constraints, short-term and long-term objectives. Throughout, we draw on three examples of cyber-physical systems that may benefit from self-awareness: a multi-processor system-on-chip, a Mars rover, and an implanted insulin pump. These three very different systems nevertheless have similar characteristics: limited resources, complex unforeseeable environmental dynamics, high expectations on their reliability, and substantial levels of risk associated with malfunctioning. Using these examples, we discuss the potential role of self-awareness in both highly complex and rather more simple systems, and as a main conclusion we highlight the need for research on above listed topics."

Predominantly, adolescent girls have been found to be engaged in levels of physical activity (PA) below the daily recommended guideline of at least 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity, and especially during weekends. Lack of sufficient PA can lead to a risk of contracting non-communicable diseases. The purpose of this exploratory study was to investigate the efficacy of using mobile applications (app) (i.e. MapMyFitness [MMF]) in changing adolescent girls’ PA behaviour during weekends. It also examined the perceived benefits, challenges and recommendations for using mobile apps. Thirty-six participants aged 15 years ( M age = 14.9; SD = 0.30) from a convenience sample volunteered and took part in the present study, which spanned four weekends. Quantitative results showed a significant difference in the mean step count between experimental and control groups during week two, probably due to the novelty effect when the participants were introduced to the new MMF mobile app. Overall, the use of the MMF app seems to be able to attenuate the decline of adolescent girls’ PA level during weekends. Qualitative results revealed benefits of using mobile apps to promote PA, such as a sense of autonomy in selecting PA, the ability to view friends’ postings of PA and self-monitoring of PA. The study revealed specific challenges to using such PA mobile apps - in particular, factors such as the cumbersome and confusing functions in the app that discouraged users from performing PA. Recommendations included allowing users to customise their accounts, simplifying the app’s functions, and including rewards and videos as motivators to enhance users’ PA experience. Although mobile apps may have the potential to encourage participation in PA, a careful selection of mobile app functions is required to engage adolescent girls to continue to use it for PA."

African people are increasingly datafied dehumanised and denied self-knowledge, self-mastery, self-organisation and data sovereignty. Arguing for more attention to questions of data sovereignty, this paper notes that the Internet of Things and Big Data threaten the autonomy, privacy, data and national sovereignty of indigenous Africans. It is contended that decolonial scholars should unpack ethical implications of theorising indigenous people in terms of relational theories that assume absence of distinctions between humans and nonhumans. Deemed to be indistinct from nonhumans/animals, Africans would be inserted or implanted with remotely controlled intelligent tracking technological devices that mine data from their brains, bodies, homes, cities and so on.\n Key words: relationality, Big Data, Internet of Things, coloniality, research"

Participants of the present study consisted of forty-six students who were chosen randomly from third- year students enrolled in English section at Faculty of Education, Sohag University, Egypt. The design of the study is the two-group post-assessment design, (N=23) for the experimental group and (N=23) for the control group. Both groups were tested before and after the intervention. The instruments of the research included a writing autonomy scale (WAS) and the suggested web-mediated process genre (WMPG) -based program. Results of the research revealed a statistically significant difference between the mean score of the experimental group and that of the control group in the post test of WAS in favor of the experimental group. These results were ascribed to using a program based on the combination of the process approach and the genre approach via the facilities of the Internet."

Añaños \n María del Mar García-Vita \n Diego Galán-Casado \n Rocío Raya-Miranda \nThis study analyses the psycho-educational and social paths of women prisoners after the time they drop out of school as minors, based on different variables related to autonomy and their preparedness to face temporary release.Qualitative and quantitative methods were used to analyse a national sample of 310 women prisoners (30.1% of the population) in 31 prisons through a mixed-mode questionnaire and interview. We analysed the significant association of variables related to dropout and obtained a log-linear model that relates dropout to recidivism and Roma culture. Work experience was analysed using the McNemar test, and variables influencing the participant’s job at the time of the study were analysed by applying cluster analysis.Young women comprise 66.6% of individuals who drop of the education system as minors (primary 49.3% and secondary 22%). They drop out between the ages of 7 and 17, and have traits of greater vulnerability than those who stayed in school until adulthood. In this population, we find a significant association with various factors: belonging to Roma culture, having family members in prison and delinquent recidivism; and higher unemployment (43.4%) and low income before entering prison. This situation is increasing today. In prison, these women had more connection to education/training, which can improve their employability. They also encounter difficulties with personal security, decision-making, personal/professional dependence, planning for the future, administrative matters and handling information and communication technologies, job-seeking skills, etc. Their self-perceived strengths are, however, assuming responsibility, taking orders, respecting schedules and timetables, working on a team and feeling prepared to start a job, as well as having optimistic convictions about the future.The vulnerabilities and risk factors studied have a negative influence primarily on processes of personal, social and job autonomy in female minors who left the education system. Yet these minors show factors of protection and resilience. On temporary release at the time of the study, they face the consequences that their prison terms and incarceration have for their perceptions, attitudes, competencies and future prospects, as well as social marginalization and stigma. Early, coherent socio-educational interventions are thus needed to improve social integration-reintegration."

Our analysis starts from the concept of mediation to problematize the belief, widespread in much of contemporary society, that the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques for algorithmic filtering of big data will provide answers and solutions to all our questions and problems. We will argue that the algorithmic mediation of information on the internet, which is responsible for deciding which information we will have access to and which will remain invisible, is operated according to the economic interests of the companies that control the platforms we visit on the internet, acting as obstacle to the prospects of informational diversity and autonomy that are fundamental in free and democratic societies."

This type of training can be applied at any stage or educational typology such as basic vocational training. The main objective of this article is to know the degree of effectiveness of this methodology in this stage, specifically in an applied science module. For this purpose, a quasi-experimental design has been applied with a control group and an experimental group with a total of 147 participants. The results show how those students who have worked through b-learning have experienced better results in all the dimensions of the study. In conclusion, the implementation of this methodology in basic vocational training brings benefits, such as motivation and autonomy in the teaching–learning processes of all students."

The work is based on a set of general scientific and special legal methods, including analysis, description, ge ne ra li zation, com parative law. The formation of legal definitions of artificial intelligence and related concepts (ro bot, cyber-physical system, etc.) requires the identification of the main legal fe atures of artificial intelligence. The following key characteristics of artificial in tel li gence are identified: optional hardware implementation; the ability of the system to analyze the environment; autonomy in operation; the ability to accumulate experience, its assessment and implementation of the task of self-learning; the pre sence of “intelligence”, described through the categories of “rationality”, “rationality” or simply the ability to “think like a person” or “act like a person” in all or in narrowly defined circumstances. Future legal regimes of artificial intelligence should take into account the possibility of weak artificial intelligence as a kind of complex thing and strong artificial intelligence that will “require” new legal solutions. The formation of legal definitions in the field of artificial intelligence must meet the requirements of universality, system city and ethics, and also allow, based on the selected properties, to establish systemic hierarchical relationships between concepts used in the field of artificial intelligence. The study develops the theoretical and practice-oriented provisions of in for mation law in matters of legal support for artificial intelligence, and also creates the basis for the formation of legislation in this area. The work can be used in further research activities on the legal regulation of the development, functioning and use of artificial intelligence systems."

Alshammary \nThis study sought to investigate the impact of using Cambly, a computer-mediated communication tool, on the speaking proficiency of English as a foreign language (EFL) learners. Further, it aimed to explore the participants&rsquo; perceptions of using Cambly. The study employed an experimental design featuring a mixed-methods approach to data collection that involved pre- and post-testing of the participants&rsquo; speaking proficiency as well as semi-structured face-to-face interviews. The study sample consisted of 28 EFL university students who were divided into the control and experimental groups. The participants in the experimental group used Cambly to conduct audio calls with native speakers of English over a period of 4 weeks. The quantitative analysis of the participants&rsquo; speaking proficiency tests revealed no significant differences between the experimental and control groups&rsquo; post-test scores. Moreover, no significant differences were found between the experimental group&rsquo;s pre- and post-test scores. The qualitative analysis of the participants&rsquo; interviews revealed that the use of Cambly had a positive influence on their speaking proficiency, motivation, anxiety level, speaking opportunities, autonomy, social relationships, and cultural awareness."

It presupposes the implementation of ways and forms aimed at active rather than passive learning, an increased sense of academic autonomy, development of motivation, responsibility and accountability in acquiring profession-specific knowledge, skills, communicative abilities and attitudes as well as interdependence and mutual respect between the academic teacher and the student.\n The authors of the article argue that the language tuition to students majoring in translation studies contributing to the overall development of their professional competence of intercultural mediators can be carried out in the form of extra-curricular activities via information and communication technology tools.\n With respect to the results of the grounded study of current tendencies, achievements and problems, valuable experience and outcomes related to the issue under consideration, the paper reflects on two extra-curricular activities, their stages, aims, objectives and tasks performed; analyses their importance and efficiency in promoting students’ autonomy and responsibility; outlines the role and the functions of information and communication technology tools used.\n The English Speaking Club involves specially arranged meetings intended to provide practising English autonomously outside the classroom context. Participating in conversations with a native speaker students have the opportunity to improve their vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation skills, enrich their background knowledge of traditions and culture of the English-speaking countries as well as overcome psychological barriers while expressing personal views and ideas.\n Translation and Voice Over Recording Studio is organised as a project activity tailored to initiate student translators and interpreters to the real workflow of a project team specialising in translation of different types of audio and video texts in the English language into Ukrainian and their further voice over recording. Performing roles of translators, proofreaders, editors, voice-over artists and sound directors, the participants have the opportunity to practically implement knowledge, skills and communicative abilities obtained while learning profession-specific subjects at the university, developing and improving translation and interpretation skills in particular. Specially selected information and communication technology tools provide the efficient organisation of the Club’s and Studio’s work."

As news organizations relinquish control over distribution, they may feel the need to optimize their content to align with platform logics to ensure economic sustainability. However, the opaque and often proprietary nature of platform algorithms makes it hard for news organizations to truly know what kinds of content are preferred and will perform well. Invoking the concept of algorithmic ‘folk theories,’ this article presents a study of in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 18 U.S.-based news journalists and editors to understand how they make sense of social media algorithms, and to what extent this influences editorial decision making. Our findings suggest that while journalists’ understandings of platform algorithms create new considerations for gatekeeping practices, the extent to which it influences those practices is often negotiated against traditional journalistic conceptions of newsworthiness and journalistic autonomy."

Elaine Prewitt \n Paul Kinder \n Lindsey Haynes-Maslow \nIn an effort to elucidate an aspirational vision for the food system and explore whether the characteristics of such a system inadvertently set unattainable standards for low-wealth rural communities, we applied discourse analysis to the following qualitative datasets: (1) interviews with food experts and advocates, (2) scholarly and grey literature, (3) industry websites, and (4) email exchanges between food advocates. The analysis revealed eight aspirational food system discourses: production, distribution, and infrastructure; healthy, organic, local food; behavioral health and education; sustainability; finance and investment; hunger relief; demand-side preferences; romanticized, community led transformations. Study findings reveal that of eight discourses, only three encompass the experiences of low-wealth rural residents. This aspirational food system may aggravate the lack of autonomy and powerlessness already experienced by low-wealth rural groups, perpetuate a sense of failure by groups who will be unable to reach the aspirational food vision, silence discourses that might question those that play a role in the inequitable distribution of income while sanctioning discourses that focus on personal or community solutions, and leave out other policy-based solutions that address issues located within the food system. Further research might explore how to draw attention to silenced discourses on the needs and preferences of low-wealth rural populations to ensure that the policies and programs promoted by food system experts mitigate poor diets caused by food insecurity. Further research is needed to inform policies and programs to mitigate food insecurity in low-wealth rural populations."

Method : Data were collected through semistructured interviews with 48 physical educators who had actively used various social media professionally for an extended period of time. The data were analyzed inductively and aligned to the basic psychological needs defined by self-determination theory: relatedness, autonomy, and competence. Results : Building relationships with a trusted network of people and opportunities to express their autonomy were important drivers in the participants’ genesis and continued use of social media. Developing competence at both the start and throughout their social media journey was also critical. Discussion/Conclusions : The findings provide a starting point for in-depth research on the motivational characteristics underpinning physical educators’ reasons for starting and continuing to use social media for professional development and learning, and how these might change over time based on different psychological needs."

The implementation of ICTs in this population, however, is sometimes challenging to their cognitive and age characteristics. Ultimately, this might compromise the effectiveness of ICT-enhanced therapies in this population. The aim of this study is to test the usability and acceptability of a European project prototype for elderly care, in an attempt to explore the ICT design needs of users with MCI. Methods: Participants were 28 individuals aged 58–95 years and with a diagnosis of MCI. Results: The results showed a low perception of peripheral elements and the need to place main interaction elements in the centre of the screen. The correlation between the general level of autonomy (daily life activities) and the ICT autonomy level was significant and positive. The speed of audio help had a significant impact on performance. Conclusion: The present work contributes to the literature on ICT usability needs of users with MCI. Some usability recommendations for designing interfaces for this type of user are provided in the text."

Digital control offers society and the individuals in that society a multitude of opportunities, but also brings new social and ethical challenges. Important public values are at stake, closely linked to fundamental and human rights. This paper focuses on the public value of autonomy, and shows that digitization—by analysis and application of data—can have a profound effect on this value in all sorts of aspects in our lives: in our material, biological, and socio-cultural lives. Since the supervision of autonomy is hardly organized, we need to clarify through reflection and joint debate about what kind of control and human qualities we do not want to lose in the digital future."

Drawing upon semi-structured interviews with 21 users who used Moments for at least 6 months, then voluntarily discontinued their use of the feature, we discuss the complex dynamics of Moments use, exploring the implicit micro-behavioral process of social media practice. Countering the purported hyper-centrality of WeChat, we identified a periodic loop of “use, non-use, reuse” of Moments, suggesting that people suspend their use of Moments periodically to “re-domesticate” technology. Through the prism of the domestication approach, we argue that the re-domestication of Moments is a “reboot” of the whole process of domestication through four key stages: re-appropriation, re-objectification, re-incorporation, and re-conversion. Re-domestication is a process that allows people to take a retrospective look at their lives and transform Moments from a disruptive app feature into an instrumental apparatus conducive to their personal and professional well-being. By examining this process, we discuss how people use innovative ways to regain their autonomy and agency in their daily interactions with WeChat."

The constructivist perspective encourages the use of methods that promote teamwork, an interest for information searching, autonomy and an increased motivation for learning, among others. Currently, the acquisition of the established curricular content receives feedback thanks to information and communication technologies (ICTs). This research describes the implementation of an experience related to the use of teaching/learning participatory methods with first- and second-year students in Early Childhood Education and Primary Education bachelor’s degrees. This experience is based on flipped classrooms and role-playing and is supported by ICTs. A questionnaire was delivered to a total of 100 individuals on their perception of participatory methods and their assessment of the methods used for the described experience. After performing the analysis, the conclusions showed that higher education students considered that classroom implementation of emerging methods helped them at a theoretical, practical and professional level as well as motivated them, which allows us to advance towards the goals of the EHEA."

Степанян \n Т. С. Заплатина \nWe are currently experiencing a new revolution, which is related to the Internet, nanotechnology, biotechnology and robotics. Artificial intelligence is based on intelligent algorithms or learning algorithms similar to human intelligence, technologies make it possible for computer systems to acquire independence, self-adaptive reconfiguration. The greater the autonomy of AI, robots, and androids, the less they depend on manufacturers, owners, and users. The fact that the new generation of robots will coexist with humans should be taken into account in legislation, it should adapt and regulate issues of great legal significance, namely: who takes responsibility for the actions or inaction of intelligent robots? What is their legal status? Should they have a special regime of rights and obligations? How to resolve ethical conflicts related to their behavior? The analysis of legislation and doctrine in Latin America has revealed some trends in the use of AI. 1. The use of AI in various spheres of public life causes legal problems in terms of guaranteeing human rights, as evidenced by the analysis of the constitutions of Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. For example, article 8 of the American Convention on Human Rights states: “Everyone has the right to have his case heard, with appropriate guarantees and within a reasonable period of time, before a competent, independent and impartial court convened in advance by law in support of any criminal charge brought against him or to determine his rights or obligations of a civil, labour, financial or any other nature.” 2. The similarity of AI and human intelligence raises the question of legal personality of AI, granting AI rights. The civil and commercial code of Argentina departs from the category of “human person” and establishes the term “legal persons”: “all persons to whom the legal system grants the ability to acquire rights are legal persons for the purpose of fulfilling their purpose and obligations”. The line between things and people is becoming more blurred, technology and a more sensitive view of other living beings lead to doubt whether man is the sole subject of law."

Sporadic research has examined the association between autonomy need dissatisfaction and problematic mobile phone use (PMPU). Boredom proneness and mobile phone gaming were suggested to be linked to this association. This study aimed to examine the mediating effects of boredom proneness and mobile phone gaming in the association between autonomy need dissatisfaction and PMPU. A total of 358 secondary school students completed questionnaires at three waves; autonomy need dissatisfaction was measured in time 1 (T1); boredom proneness and mobile phone gaming were measured one year later (time 2, T2); PMPU was measured two years later (time 3, T3). The structural equation model results showed that T1 autonomy need dissatisfaction not only directly predicted T3 PMPU, but also exerted effects via the mediating role of T2 boredom proneness and the chain mediating role of T2 boredom proneness and T2 mobile phone gaming. These findings reveal the unique role of specific psychological need in engaging PMPU, which provides support to targeted interventions, such that promoting autonomy need satisfaction may be an instrumental procedure to prevent adolescents from addiction-like online behaviors."

Furthermore, we tested if an intervention, affirmation of these psychological needs, enhances mental well-being. Results of Study 1 ( N = 153) showed that higher levels of satisfaction of BPN were related to higher well-being during the COVID-19 outbreak. In Study 2 ( N = 215), we employed an online intervention enhancing these BPN. We found increased mental well-being through bolstered relatedness in particular. The intervention also decreased perceived stress. Both studies showed that mental well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic is positively related to the ability to work as usual and the number of people contacted via phone or internet but not in person."

As a consequence, employees face additional cognitive demands to plan, structure, and coordinate their work. In order to capture these demands of contemporary work, we constructed and validated the Cognitive Demands of Flexible Work (CODE) scale. The scale comprises four subscales (i.e., structuring of work tasks, planning of working times, planning of working places, and coordinating with others). We validated the scale in three independent samples (N = 1129) in both English and German. Confirmatory Factor Analyses supported the four-factor structure as well as the metric invariance of the different language versions. Moreover, the subscales showed convergent validity with related constructs such as requirements for problem solving or autonomy. Criterion validity for emotional exhaustion, engagement, and problem-solving pondering suggests that cognitive demands of flexible work organizations can be construed as challenge stressors. However, relationships with emotional exhaustion only showed when autonomy was controlled for. Overall, the CODE scale was shown to be a reliable and valid instrument to measure cognitive demands of flexibly organized work."

Garavan \n Mark Boons \n Fang Lee Cooke \n Anna B. Holm \n Ronan Carbery \n Ultan Sherman \n Ana Alina Tudoran \n Tianyu Wang \nThe growing gig economy has emerged as a significant theme of discussion in the world of work. Involving dynamic multi-party working arrangements between workers, digital platform organizations and requesters (i.e. customers), the gig economy is reshaping our understanding of the working relationship. Competing narratives around gig work explore the supposed autonomy afforded to workers, the disruptive role of the algorithmic management function, and the challenges created by various legal ambiguities. This symposium aims to advance our understanding of this relatively novel phenomenon by examining key issues that exist in gig work and the most critical implications for HRM and employment relations scholarship. In addition to these perspectives, we explore several other contexts by sharing novel insights on the ramifications of gig working for information systems, conflict management, and legal debates. For organizations, our symposium examines the concept of algorithmic management in gig work, its role in implementing HRM activities, and its impact in shaping worker autonomy. For workers, we provide insights on how individuals may enact the autonomy provided to them by platforms, how workers may respond if expectations of flexibility are unmet, and the legal complexities arising from the fragmented nature of gig work. For requesters, we explore the novel role that customers hold in implementing HRM activities in gig work via rating mechanisms, and the subsequent implications for workers. Finally, our discussant will integrate the studies, draw theoretical and practical conclusions, and offer suggestions for advancing the topic.

Given that past studies have primarily focused on the potential merits of these emerging technologies, less is known about the hidden power dynamics involved in the enactment of ESM. In this paper, we present the findings of an ethnographic study at a startup accelerator in which we examined how and why the enactment of ESM shapes and (re)produces power dynamics. Based on our analysis, we develop a process model that theorizes the emergence of autonomy–control tensions in the enactment of ESM through continual drifts of decision-making between the online and offline worlds. As we show, these drifts are produced through non liquets and the emergence of urgency. Furthermore, we demonstrate the consequentiality of these dynamics, which turn ESM into an irreducible part of organizational processes. Our findings contribute to the burgeoning literature at the intersection of emerging technologies and organizing by surfacing power-related, potentially detrimental side effects inherent to organizing through such technologies."

    "text": "Doc 1223 :  The obstacles faced by distance learning students in achieving their autonomy. The case of the Hellenic Open University \nhttps://doi.org/10.12681/jode.23209\n Maria Panagiotis Panagiotopoulou \n Eyagelia Nikolaos Manousou \nSummaryThe autonomy of the students refers to the control that the student has in the learning process, to decide on the content, the goals and the way of learning and is connected with the concepts of self-direction and self-regulation. The concept of autonomy presupposes the development of a psychological relationship with the process and the content of the learning act, while the autonomous student is able to make decisions, to distance himself but also to reflect critically. Autonomy is related to the notion of personal responsibility that the learner assumes in his learning process, while two dimensions are distinguished. The first is autonomous learning, in which the learner assumes responsibility for the design, organization and evaluation of the educational process, which concerns its external characteristics. The second is the autonomous student, which refers to the internal characteristics of the learner. However, an important factor for the autonomy of the students is considered to be the context in which the educational process takes place, ie when the general socio-political and learning context encourages the learners to take responsibility for their learning, then their autonomy is promoted.In the context of distance education, students are at a distance from their teachers, their classmates and the institution that provides education, but they are called to meet the requirements of the study program they choose. And while the concept of autonomy is intertwined with the method of distance education, the factors that hinder its realization have not been sufficiently explored. This empirical research, therefore, comes to fill the gap in the literature on the obstacles that students themselves face in the realization of autonomy.This paper explores the barriers faced by distance education students in achieving their autonomy. In particular, it focuses on exploring the obstacles that students face with regard to autonomy in distance education and the factors that contribute to removing the obstacles to student autonomy in distance education. The quantitative approach was chosen and the tool of our research was the online questionnaire, which was completed by 215 research participants, postgraduate and undergraduate students of the Hellenic Open University. The selection of the sample was random sampling as the questionnaire was published on a social networking page (facebook) in specific groups formed by the Hellenic Open University students and the participants chose to answer and complete the questionnaire. The empirical research took place in March - April 2019.The questionnaire included two axes. The first axis concerned demographic data. The second axis included twenty-one (21) questions that answered the research questions. Seventeen (17) of the questions were closed-ended, graded Likert scale, one (1) question with answer options, while three (3) questions were open-ended. Open-ended questions were included in order for participants to express their views on the obstacles they face, and to enrich the data from the closed-ended questions.For the analysis of the data collected from the closed-ended questions of the questionnaire, the statistical program SPSS and the descriptive statistics were used. Regarding the data of the open-ended questions, after their inclusion in broader categories, the next step was to codify the conversion of the data from nominal to numerical. In order to identify any differences in the answers of the participants, depending on the gender and the level of studies, correlations were used.The theoretical framework of the present study is closely related to the empirical research carried out. Obstacles to the autonomy of distance learning students identified in the theoretical part are confirmed by the empirical research, with the difference that the empirical research has shown that students’ personal characteristics as well as the “distance” factor do not constitute a significant obstacle to the realization of their autonomy.However, the empirical research also revealed several factors that were not identified in the bibliographic review as barriers to student autonomy, such as inadequate administrative organization, financial factors, the small number of group meetings, the lack of different types of papers, exams based on memorization and exams with books closed. It is also worth noting that while the majority of students consider that they have developed skills in order to be autonomous, they agree that a preparatory course that would prepare them for the requirements of distance education would be very helpful. The analysis and discussion of the results highlighted the prominent role of the teacher in distance education, as the lack of support for students can impede their autonomy, however, the teacher has the potential to contribute to its realization by guiding and encouraging students. The multidimensional role of the teacher in distance education also emerges from our research, as described in the theoretical part of our work, since the participants expressed the need for teachers combining a number of characteristics in order to promote their autonomy.Another important finding of the research is that students feel their personal characteristics and personal abilities can help them realize their autonomy. In line with the bibliographic review, the factors that are an obstacle to the autonomy of the students of distance education, as well as the factors contributing to the removal of these obstacles, are related both to the students themselves and to the educational process.As for the factors that contribute to the removal of barriers to the autonomy of distance learning students, they coincide with the factors that have a positive effect on the realization of autonomy and have been identified in the theoretical framework of our work. The most important factor is the personal characteristics of the students themselves and their own personal effort. Following, the support, guidance from the teacher on a psychological and practical level and communication with him. Also very important factors are the existence of appropriate educational material and the conduct of group meetings, which students ask to be more frequent.The need for a digital learning framework to promote student autonomy, as found in the theoretical framework, is confirmed by the empirical research, as well as the need for electronic group meetings and the use of electronic libraries, access to specialized digital material, and easier access to the Hellenic Open University platforms.A very important factor in removing the barriers to student autonomy as it emerged from the empirical research is more flexible schedules concerning the delivery of papers, while access to educational material and a better administrative organization are also considered important.Regarding the correlation of the curriculum with the factors that constitute an obstacle to autonomy, the majority of postgraduate and undergraduate students agree with some differentiation regarding the factors “comments of the teacher on written work”, “educational material”, “psychological support from the teacher”and“ lack of psychological support from the teacher” while gender did not appear to have any particular effect on the factors that impede students’ autonomy"

In reaction to paternalistic communication patterns, health policy makers have advocated for patient-centered care and shared decision-making. Although these models of medical communication remain still aspirational, patients have become more engaged in advocating for their own health in encounters with physicians. I argue that the engaged patient is a more accurate conceptualization of the changing role of the patient than patient consumerism, the empowered, or expert patient. I examine how the emergence of engaged patients influences the autonomy of health professionals, relates to the rise of the internet as an alternative source of medical information, centers the role of the patient–doctor interaction in public health epidemics, and contributes to health inequities."

Kolomiets \nThe development of the information society causes a new direction of socialization – media socialization, especially it’s relevant for young people, who is an active media consumer.The essence of the notions of «media space», «media socialization», «cyber socialization» are analyzed in the article. The features of the media space functioning are considered, taking into account the factors of socialization, its functions are represented in accordance with the traditional socialization process. The influence of the media on the socialization process is determined as a condition for the further development of the components in the youth media socialization. The principles of youth media socialization in the conditions of media space are offered (system, activity, bilateral interaction of personality and virtual reality, media activity and critical thinking). The components of the media-socialization process are presented (forms, mechanisms, agents of media-socialization, etc.). The indicators of successful and unsuccessful media socialization are indicated. The basic conflict of media socialization is determined, which affects its result (the balance of virtual and real).The media socialization criteria with corresponding levels of development and indicators is offered in the article (media adaptability, media autonomy, media activity). The levels of media-socialization of youth are presented in conditions of modern media space.The study of the process of youth media socialization was confirmed by the high percentage of respondents with low (38.5%) and medium (41.8%) levels of media-socialization. At the same time, the high level of media-socialization was characteristic only for 19.7% of respondents.The issue of media socialization of young people becomes acute in connection with the situation that has developed in the state. The system of social education institutions faces the challenge of initiating changes in young people entering into the media space, which in the future will create effective conditions for development taking into account media resources. The problem of youth media socialization is not limited to the research conducted. Promising areas of scientific research can be: development of socio-pedagogical conditions and technology of media-socialization of the individual; development of methodical support for the implementation of media-socialization technology in general educational institutions; introduction of foreign experience of youth media socialization into practice of social work."

    "text": "Doc 1227 :  An Empirical Study on Motivation Factors and Reward Structure for User’s Createve Contents Generation: Focusing on the Mediating Effect of Commitment \nhttps://koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201023557657680.page\n Jinwoo Kim \n Seung-Hwa Yang \n Seongtaek Lim \n Inseong Lee \nUser created content (UCC) is created and shared by common users on line. From the user’s perspective, the increase of UCCs has led to an expansion of alternative means of communications, while from the business perspective UCCs have formed an environment in which an abundant amount of new contents can be produced. Despite outward quantitative growth, however, many aspects of UCCs do not meet the expectations of general users in terms of quality, and this can be observed through pirated contents and user-copied contents. The purpose of this research is to investigate effective methods for fostering production of creative user-generated content. This study proposes two core elements, namely, reward and motivation, which are believed to enhance content creativity as well as the mediating factor and users’ committement, which will be effective for bridging the increasing motivation and content creativity. Based on this perspective, this research takes an in-depth look at issues related to constructing the dimensions of reward and motivation in UCC services for creative content product, which are identified in three phases. First, three dimensions of rewards have been proposed: task dimension, social dimension, and organizational dimention. The task dimension rewards are related to the inherent characteristics of a task such as writing blog articles and pasting photos. Four concrete ways of providing task-related rewards in UCC environments are suggested in this study, which include skill variety, task significance, task identity, and autonomy. The social dimensioni rewards are related to the connected relationships among users. The organizational dimension consists of monetary payoff and recognition from others. Second, the two types of motivations are suggested to be affected by the diverse rewards schemes: intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation. Inrinsic motivation occurs when people create new UCC contents for its’ own sake, whereas extrinsic motivation occurs when people create new contents for other purposes such as fame and money. Third, commitments are suggested to work as important mediating variables between motivation and content creativity. We believe commitments are especially important in online environments because they have been found to exert stronger impacts on the Internet users than other relevant factors do. Two types of commitments are suggested in this study: emotional commitment and continuity commitment. Finally, content creativity is proposed as the final dependent variable in this study. We provide a systematic method to measure the creativity of UCC content based on the prior studies in creativity measurement. The method includes expert evaluation of blog pages posted by the Internet users. In order to test the theoretical model of our study, 133 active blog users were recruited to participate in a group discussion as well as a survey. They were asked to fill out a questionnaire on their commitment, motivation and rewards of creating UCC contents. At the same time, their creativity was measured by independent experts using Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking. Finally, two independent users visited the study participants’ blog pages and evaluated their content creativity using the Creative Products Semantic Scale. All the data were compiled and analyzed through structural equation modeling. We first conducted a confirmatory factor analysis to validate the measurement model of our research. It was found that measures used in our study satisfied the requirement of reliability, convergent validity as well as discriminant validity. Given the fact that our measurement model is valid and reliable, we proceeded to conduct a structural model analysis. The results indicated that all the variables in our model had higher than necessary explanatory powers in terms of R-square values. The study results identified several important reward shemes. First of all, skill variety, task importance, task identity, and automony were all found to have significant influences on the intrinsic motivation of creating UCC contents. Also, the relationship with other users was found to have strong influences upon both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Finally, the opportunity to get recognition for their UCC work was found to have a significant impact on the extrinsic motivation of UCC users. However, different from our expectation, monetary compensation was found not to have a significant impact on the extrinsic motivation. It was also found that commitment was an important mediating factor in UCC environment between motivation and content creativity. A more fully mediating model was found to have the highest explanation power compared to no-mediation or partially mediated models. This paper ends with implications of the study results. First, from the theoretical perspective this study proposes and empirically validates the commitment as an important mediating factor between motivation and content creativity. This result reflects the characteristics of online environment in which the UCC creation activities occur voluntarily. Second, from the practical perspective this study proposes several concrete reward factors that are germane to the UCC environment, and their effectiveness to the content creativity is estimated. In addition to the quantitive results of relative importance of the reward factrs, this study also proposes concrete ways to provide the rewards in the UCC environment based on the FGI data that are collected after our participants finish asnwering survey questions. Finally, from the methodological perspective, this study suggests and implements a way to measure the UCC content creativity independently from the content generators’ creativity, which can be used later by future research on UCC creativity. In sum, this study proposes and validates important reward features and their relations to the motivation, commitment, and the content creativity in UCC environment, which is believed to be one of the most important factors for the success of UCC and Web 2.0. As such, this study can provide significant theoretical as well as practical bases for fostering creativity in UCC contents."

In Kenya, the Covid-19 pandemic has brought to light some unknown talents among the stakeholders at different levels. The economic sector has had manufacturing potential for goods, and from mass media reports, this has been demonstrated through production of Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs), ventilators and innovations in technology in the creation of apps such as the Linda App for contact tracing and Gumzo, a video conferencing app. Similarly, the education sector has also demonstrated potential for adaptation in some situations. For example, after all institutions of learning were closed to prevent the spread of coronavirus in March 2020, many universities have continued learning through Online, Distance and E-learning (ODEL) platforms, and some have even conducted virtual graduations. Others like Kenyatta University have reported innovations such as development of ventilators and modified testing swabs for Covid-19. This is admirable despite numerous limitations of internet accessibilities and other shortcomings. This remarkable achievement has been possible due to semi-autonomy in the university education sector, where Senates are given the right and power, by the Education Act, to make autonomous decisions for their universities which are regulated and monitored using the standards and regulations set by the Commission of University Education (CUE). However, other levels of the education sector do not have this autonomy and have had to depend on the ministry of education for guidance. On 8<sup>th</sup> July 2020, the ministry of education announced the result of a consultative meeting with stakeholders, to postpone the reopening of schools to January 2021. This was due to the rising cases of corona virus infections in May and June, steeping the infection curve, expected to reach the peak by November and to have flattened by January 2021 (Magoha, 2020). However, what surprised many was the additional and unforeseen announcement that all basic education students (apart from standard 8 and form 4 examination candidates whose details were not clarified) will repeat their current class levels in 2021. The pronouncement caused anxiety and has attracted mixed reactions from various stakeholders. The purpose of this paper is therefore to explain the leadership decisions made by the ministry of education analyze their impact on basic education and propose possible ways for educational leaders and administrators, community leaders and volunteers to facilitate home-based education during the Covid-19 pandemic. This should be done with a goal for progression and promotion of students to the next class level when the 2020 syllabus is eventually covered. The study method utilized desktop literature research where interactions with educational leaders, scholars and practitioners were used to investigate threats and opportunities in managing education during crises.</p><p> </p><p><strong> Article visualizations:</strong></p><p><img src=“/-counters-/edu_01/0641/a.php” alt=“Hit counter” /></p>"

Design/methodology/approach Minnesota Innovation Research Program (MIRP) questionnaire was adopted, aimed to environment conducive to innovation. It was applied to a sample of employees, from different hierarchical levels, who participated in an innovation training program developed and implemented by the organization. The data were analyzed to verify, in a simplified initial diagnosis, the influence of internal and external factors defined by MIRP in the company’s innovation process. Findings Innovation management process focuses predominantly on processes (71.4% of occurrences). As impact of the factors: results (88.9%), autonomy (76.3%), leadership (74.9%), resources (74.6%), internal relationship of the innovation group (73.1%), formalization (68.4%), processes (64.5%), relationship effectiveness (63.7%), external relationship of the innovation group (63.2%) and dependence on external resources (52.6%). There was confirmation that the innovation program of company is effective and that the culture of innovation is institutionalized. Research limitations/implications A crossing of supplementary information could reveal some significant difference in the perception of the innovative culture and performance of the innovation processes between distinguished profiles. Practical implications Better guidance for management of ICT/BPO companies in an Open Innovation paradigm. Social implications Better relationship among the actors of an Open Innovation industry arrangement. Originality/value Improvement of the innovation process can occur through a greater focus on Open Innovation."

Emotional and behavioral self-regulation can change when there is a threat/challenge to the three basic psychological needs for competence, relatedness and autonomy. Psychological knowledge, especially the Motivational Theory of Coping, about processes of coping with stress and its consequences on physical and mental health supported the proposal of a booklet, aiming to assist in the health and well-being promotion. The material was assessed online by eight judges regarding their understanding of language, content and relevance. The final version has 16 pages, illustrated, organized in three sections: Introduction, Identifying stress responses and Coping strategies related to the basic psychological needs. For each of them, the Booklet presents three charts, pointing out “Difficulties”, “What to avoid”, “What can be done”, and space for notes. This translation of scientific knowledge into promotional and psychoeducational material can be useful for lay people and can be used in health services, and it is available on social media."

This paper analyses the characteristics and development trend of flipped classroom research from the aspects of research fields, research topics, research methods, literature sources, author information and references. Method: This teaching method undoubtedly fully demonstrates the concept of quality education, that is, while respecting students ‘individual differences in learning, it also cultivates students’ autonomy, allowing them to learn independently and develop their ability to analyze and solve problems. The flipped classroom uses the Internet as a platform to adjust the teaching steps, which has changed the organization of teaching and learning, class and off-class, teaching and self-study. Result: Teachers can supplement other resources on the Flipping classroom. At the same time, according to the content of the textbook, the teacher should design the test questions. In addition, teachers should also participate in the discussion of students before class, answering questions for students online. Throughout the online learning process, teachers can obtain students’ mastery of the unit’s knowledge points through the support of big data, such as which knowledge points are difficult, which ones are mastered, and which students are well mastered, so that the teaching can be effectively adjusted. plan. The main content of the teacher in the pre-course period is to check the content of the student’s reply in the classroom exchange area to understand the students’ knowledge of the knowledge points. Conclusion: It can be seen from the above column chart that the following conclusions can be drawn through the investigation and study of the factors affecting the College psychology teaching in colleges and universities. University leaders have a certain degree of emphasis on College psychology courses, but teaching management needs to be Further improvement; the number of people in some psychology majors is too high. Some colleges and universities in the teaching objectives of psychology special courses lack the target requirements of students’ social adaptation and scientific research; most of the teachers’ theoretical teaching content is not comprehensive enough and the content is single. Discussion: This article is based on an in-depth analysis of the advantages of domestic SPOC platforms and flipped classrooms, and analyzes the course goals of psychological teaching in colleges and universities. A teaching model of psychological courses based on the SPOC platform was constructed. This article is based on the teaching of psychology, and discusses the problems related to the flip reading teaching of psychology. The purpose is to sort out the theoretical and practical problems of flipped reading teaching in psychology lessons, and better adapt to the teaching of psychology lessons in the new era and new technology."

Grandon \n Jorge Alfaro-Perez \nThe growth of older adults in new regions poses challenges for public health. We know that these seniors live increasingly alone, and this impairs their health and general wellbeing. Studies suggest that social networking sites (SNS) can reduce isolation, improve social participation, and increase autonomy. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the characteristics of older adult users of SNS in these new territories. Without this information, it is not possible to improve the adoption of SNS in this population. Based on decision trees, this study analyzes how the elderly users of various SNS in Chile are like. For this purpose, a segmentation of the different groups of elderly users of social networks was constructed, and the most discriminating variables concerning the use of these applications were classified. The results highlight the existence of considerable differences between the various social networks analyzed in their use and characterization. Educational level is the most discriminating variable, and gender influences the types of SNS use. In general, it is observed that the higher the educational level, the more the different social networking sites are used."

Park \n Natalia Booth \n Kathleen L. Bagot \n Simone N. Rodda \nGaming Disorder is a recognised mental health condition with a very narrow range of treatment options. This pre-post study recruited 50 adult gamers from New Zealand to test the feasibility of a brief internet-delivered intervention. The intervention components were derived from Implementation Intention principles whereby the gap between intention and behaviour was targeted. The intervention delivery was in accordance with Self-Determination Theory to facilitate autonomy (personalised goals and action plans), competence (facilitated coping plans, self-monitoring, and relapse prevention) and relatedness (access to a goal coach providing written feedback and support to implement plans). Follow-up evaluation at 3-months indicated the intervention was feasible as it demonstrated rapid recruitment, program engagement (86% used the program), and high satisfaction (easy to understand and convenient). Plans most frequently focused on behavioural substitution and lifestyle change, and the most frequent barrier to change was time management followed by social pressure. Completers (n ​= ​35) reported a significant increase in well-being and reduction in severity, intensity, and time spent gaming, which reduced from an average of 29 to 11 ​hours per week. Delivery of a brief internet-delivered intervention shows promise and could be used to treat people experiencing problems who are unable or unwilling to access face-to-face treatment. • A brief intervention is associated with reduced gaming time and frequency, and symptom severity. • 88% of participants elected to reduce gaming, with just 12% planning abstinence. • Time management and social pressure are the most salient barriers to change. • Personalised change plans most often target substitution and lifestyle change. • Brief and focused coaching can facilitate engagement with an internet-delivered program."

Drawing from Self-Determination theory (SDT), the program aimed at satisfying teachers’ autonomy, competence, and relatedness needs and facilitating their autonomous motivation. Pre-post measurements showed significant improvements in key variables that can determine training success. Preliminary quantitative group insights supported by qualitative data revealed enhanced participatory dynamics in terms of members’ interaction. Findings suggest that PE.T.Co.N. is a promising, innovative approach to teacher training. Implications are discussed in light of SDT. • PE teacher in-service training can be delivered effectively as a CoP through Facebook groups. • Facebook appears a promising tool to tackle the attrition issue in on-line training. • PETCoN participation leads/contributes to increased autonomy need satisfaction. • PETCoN increases relatedness need satisfaction and decreases relatedness frustration. • Self-determination theory is well suited when designing teacher in-service training."

To ensure the continuity of learning and education, various educational institutes used the concept of online learning using information and communication technology. The effectiveness of education through online learning has been a great challenge for the students as well as for the teachers. In this regard, the current study has been designed with the motive to find out the impact of teacher’s perceived technological knowledge, teachers e-autonomy and ICT pedagogical practices on the technology integration in knowledge delivery along with the mediating role of perceived effect of teaching with technology on students in the educational institutions of Pakistan. The data was collected from 447 teachers teaching online through ICT and the results were obtained through the analysis of the collected data. The results have suggested that all the independent variables i.e. teacher’s perceived technological knowledge, teachers’ e-autonomy, and ICT pedagogical practices are having a significant impact on the technology integration in knowledge delivery. On the other hand, in case of mediating role of perceived effect of teaching with technology is considered, it is found significant in case of only teacher’s perceived technological knowledge and teacher’s e-autonomy but in case of the relation between ICT pedagogical practices, the mediating role of PETT is not significant."

It has enabled people to access information, interact with communities, share experiences, find entertainment, and learn. This paper explores an online community on Instagram where members connect by sharing narratives, stories, memories, and other accounts of foreign language learning. The research seeks to assess the ways an online community on Instagram can be a learning network. It also investigates the affordances perceived by the community members in their language learning histories (LLHs). The analysis revealed that the community matches the network principles proposed by Downes (2012): autonomy , diversity, openness, and interactivity. Also, LLHs reveal that, in their personal learning networks, narrators have perceived affordances to interact with foreign language speakers; explore multimodality; make connections between native and foreign language; interact with technologies and cultural artifacts; practise repetition; find personal connections with the foreign language; participate in fandoms; and pay attention to foreign language speakers. The stories shared in the learning network indicate that the actions upon affordances perceived in informal environments seem to have a positive impact on learners’ linguistic repertoires, identities, and emotions."

But even the most advanced such complex devices, are not yet effectively able to largely replace the wheelchairs. Therefore, until the overall complete wheelchairs’ substitutes, will meet, in this purpose, all the necessary related requirements, we have determined, and accordingly, designed – from a double perspective: of professionals and of (a) consumer – a series of necessary and rather accessible/feasible, consistent: mechanical and electro-mechanical improvements, to the current common type of wheelchairs, in order to improve the global functioning, autonomy and consequently, the quality of life in the needing people, with severe mobility restraints. These, for now, narratively innovative concepts and specifically designed, practical/technological-constructive solutions, target 10 main kinds of beneficial outcomes, i.e. a decalogue and their derivatives to be expected (most of them previously imagined by us but not completely designed until now, two of them already achieved but which need updating and other four entirely new), that could result in an “all-in-one” product paradigm which, to our knowledge, is not available at present. This model of wheelchair we propose is, at the same time, modular, so a certain consumer can purchase/ be offered only his/her own case-specific needed optimization components of it"

It brings together an analysis of images tagged and shared under the hashtag #qualitytime on Instagram with an investigation into the trope’s resonance in everyday life. In the interviews and profiles studied in this article, people used the term to indicate and display instances of self-determined solitude or of fulfilling conviviality in which mobile phones and social media were conspicuously absent. At the same time, the notion required them to carve out and valorize moments of purpose, a goal that was often unattainable. Use of the hashtag was thus accompanied by both the opportunity and the obligation to aspire to temporary retreats in which free time was employed for meaningful activity. This means that the somewhat pretentious keyword signifies the ideal of temporal autonomy while also pointing to the slim chance of finding uncompromised spells of time within harried leisure."

This study aims to investigate the differential effects of task characteristics on individuals’ knowledge withholding behavior in online space, this study develops and empirically verifies a theoretical model that covers the five core task characteristics in job characteristics model (autonomy, identity, feedback, skill variety and significance), knowledge sharing self-inefficacy and withholding effort in sharing knowledge. Design/methodology/approach Using an online survey method, this study collected empirical data from 351 general internet users from 30 provincial administrative units in China. The data were analyzed using the structural equation modeling technique of partial least squares. Findings The analysis results indicate that autonomy negatively affects, while identity, skill variety and significance positively affect users’ knowledge withholding behavior in online space through the mediation of knowledge sharing self-inefficacy, and that three task characteristics (autonomy, identity and feedback) strengthen the relationship between knowledge sharing self-inefficacy and knowledge withholding. Practical implications This study provides valuable insights for reducing knowledge withholding behavior in online space. Operationally, different levels of task characteristics such as autonomy, identity and feedback can be set to prevent users from perceiving themselves as inefficacious, and to weaken the behavioral expression of knowledge sharing self-inefficacy. Originality/value This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the differential effects of task characteristics on knowledge withholding in online space, and improves the cognition of the boundaries of withholding effort in sharing knowledge in online space."

Überlegungen zum Strukturwandel von Öffentlichkeit und Privatheit \nhttps://doi.org/10.30965/25890859-04901007\n David Waldecker \n Oliver Schmidtke \n Kathrin Englert \nAbstract The internet has led to a rearrangement of the public and private spheres. Social media in particular have contributed to the blurring of boundaries between public and private as they allow for unrestricted self-representation via text, images, and video to a more or less unlimited online audience. More than ever, individuals are thus forced to take into account questions of un/desired observability. For a critical analysis of this development, this article draws upon Jürgen Habermas’ The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere and Beate Rössler’s The Value of Privacy . Both authors argue that the modulation of publicness and privacy is intertwined with the process of individuation and hence concerns the autonomy of the individual, as self-realization depends upon responses from others, but also upon the ability to withdraw from public scrutiny. Drawing upon their findings, the article discusses if and how social media enhance or delimit self-realization and therefore serve or hinder individuation and autonomy."

Mohammed Abubakar \n Mohammad Fahmi Al-Zyoud \nAbstract Modern organizations must use the Internet, digital and mobile devices to respond to business demands efficiently. It is also imperative for practitioners and researchers to understand the adverse effects of problematic Internet and mobile device usage in the workplace. Moreover, findings from existing studies are insufficient or less relevant or lack applicability in the context of workplace safety behavior. This paper contributes to the literature by examining the mechanisms in which problematic Internet usage lowers workers safety behavior and the moderating role of time autonomy. Data was obtained from workers in the Turkish maritime industry using a simple random sampling technique (n = 344) and analyzed with partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Results from PLS-SEM demonstrate that problematic Internet use reduces safety behavior and time autonomy enhances safety behavior. Time autonomy attenuates the negative impact of problematic Internet use on safety behavior. Unlike previous studies, this paper highlights the pernicious effects of problematic Internet use and beneficial effects of time autonomy in shaping modern workplace safety behaviors. Based on these results, several managerial prescriptions and theoretical implications are rendered, and future research directions are highlighted."

Design/methodology/approach The study applies content analysis and regression techniques. The ICD is analyzed for Spanish municipalities with more than 100,000 inhabitants and provincial capitals over a period from January 2018 to February 2020. Findings Findings emphasize that the quantity of disclosed information on intellectual capital (IC) is in the low level, particularly with regard to human capital (HC). Furthermore, the results show that the information provided via social media mainly concerns the relational capital (RC). On the other hand, results obtained indicate that larger municipalities, with lower financial autonomy and whose citizens have a high income level use the online media (both websites and social media) more actively to disclose information about IC. Finally, municipalities led by women and with high level of citizens’ education exert a positive influence in the ICD only on websites. Practical implications This paper makes a number of key contributions to the existing body of knowledge, focusing on ICD, a neglected area in the public sector accounting literature. It explores and identifies the supply-side and demand-side determinants of information affecting the ICD in local governments. The results of this research could be useful for policymakers, regulators and governments’ managers to improve the online information addressing ICD issues. Originality/value This paper adopts an innovative perspective by investigating the use of alternative tools for ICD in local government context (websites and social media). To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study that focuses on investigating the determinants of online ICD in local governments."

Prior research on parental mediation is inconclusive about the effectiveness or superiority of any mediation strategy. Additionally, concerns and awareness of risks were not previously studied with respect to mediation strategies. A mixed-method study involved a survey of 357 adolescents ages 12–18 and 156 young adolescents ages 9–11, followed by semi-structured interviews with parents, teachers and adolescents. Various behavioral, attitudinal, perceptual and habitual aspects of adolescent Internet use and types of parental mediation were measured. Results illustrate how parents combine mediation strategies in a variety of formats and contexts. Restrictive mediation correlated with increased adolescent concerns, suggesting an internalization of risks and consequences of Internet use. However, restrictive mediation correlated with decreased Internet activity and increased risks, possibly due to lack of adolescent experience and autonomy in navigating online risks. Conversely, active mediation correlated with increased Internet activity of any sort, which enables experimentation and autonomy in using the Internet, and did not correlate with risk. The study compares mediation strategies with parenting styles and concludes that a balanced combination of restrictive and active mediation, arguably supplies the best grounds for adolescents to develop a strong set of norms and boundaries and be able to self-regulate their own Internet activities."

The purpose of this study is to highlight the ethical issues related to the use of the Internet by women in their medical care.Through a systematic literature review conducted on PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, CINAHL and Embase between June and July 2019, 10 670 results were obtained, and 79 articles were included in the post-selection study. A thematic analysis was conducted on these articles.More than 90% of pregnant women use Internet, particularly to find medical information and social support, mainly on pregnancy and childbirth. This research allows them more equitable access to knowledge and develops their empowerment, which modifies the relationship between caregiver and patient, through the acquisition of greater autonomy for women and the development of experiential knowledge. This access offers a central and active role to pregnant women in their medical care. However, many authors also agree on the possible abuses of this use: misinformation, disproportionate information and the presence of judgment that undermine empowerment, but also digital divide and inequity in understanding information, stigmatization of women, and risks of privacy breaches on data acquired online.In order to provide pregnant women with the central and active place they seek, the authors recommend involving caregivers in the referral to reliable sites, encouraging them to develop online content, and educating pregnant women in the search for health information on Internet."

This article contributes to research carried out on public communication news flows of SNSs, presenting an analysis focusing on the visual content posted on institutional information channels dedicated to young people and managed by youth policy actors. The content of photos was analyzed in relation to 6 categories of public communication topics, 3 categories of communication aims, 6 categories of visual elements and 10 thematic areas. The empirical basis consists of 702 images taken from 15 accounts of Italian and European youth policy Instagram channels. The results show the main features of institutional flows on Instagram and a comparison with what has emerged from previous research projects relating to Facebook and Twitter. The findings focus on institutional topics and promotional aims and on the weaknesses of the flow of images in terms of social and political issues, engagement, public-service information, semantic autonomy and emotional impact. The limits that emerge from the research identify certain critical questions which indicate a need for further investigation with respect to relationships occurring between public news flows, young people, information requirements and social networks in the public sphere."

    "text": "Doc 1247 :  Bye Bye Blackbird: A Reflection Of The Struggle For Female Autonomy Against A Rigid System Of Patriarchy \n\n Saptorshi Das \n Sayantika Bose Chakraborty \n Mohar Banerjee Biswas \nI am a married woman. I am also a working woman. I love what I do. And I am actually paid to do what I love. Yet, everyday I return home from work with a heavy heart. No. My workplace poses no threats. Although many working women across the world would disagree with me; but fortunately, I am not one of them. My greatest threat is my returning home to my in-laws and tolerating their snide comments on my being out all day. The men in the house can do it. That is not a problem. But my going and staying out to work is a matter of domestic debate. I usually don’t retaliate. But I cannot help brooding over, from time to time, how unfair life still is towards women. When you really think about it, the fact that women all over the world are still fighting for equal rights defies all logic. Humans have mastered flight, walked on the moon and created the internet but women still can’t be trusted to make autonomous decisions about their own bodies, be guaranteed freedom from violence or harassment or get paid the same amount as men for doing the same damn work. From time to time, many women have voiced their disgruntlement over the gender inequality. Anita Desai is one such powerful and persuasive voice among the writers, endeavouring in all her works to reflect the how the female autonomy strives to prove its existence in a strictly patriarchal cultural pattern. This paper seeks to refer to one of her novels, Bye, Bye Black Bird (1971) to highlight the way man-woman relationships are bedevilled by cultural encounters. The novel deals with alienation of an English lady, Sarah, married to Adit, an immigrant from India, who spends her days wallowed in the guilt of committing a mistake of marrying an Indian in her own society. In spite of being a woman from the so-called advanced west, she is quiet, meek and submissive; while Adit, behaves most of the time, like a typical Indian male, conservative, rigid and patriarchal. Through Sarah, Desai draws our attention to the annihilation of self that marriage involves for a female, through a recurring theme of insecurity, fragmentation, homelessness and the quest for identity among different communities across the world."

Therefore, there is a need for an electronic Self-Access Language Learning (e-SALL) innovation to address the newly emerging issues in the field. This perspectives article suggests several ways of facilitating self-access learning using web-based technologies. It also includes some key technological and pedagogical considerations in providing in-person learning access beyond the school. We argue that the integration between a Learning Management System (LMS) as a web-based learning platform and the internet-based materials and resources will sustain the in-person learning practice from a lens of technology and the pedagogy of learner autonomy."

However, there are great challenges ahead including problems amongst younger Indonesians which may hinder the realization of this projection. This study brings to the fore the problem of teenage marriage, defined as the marriage of two individuals under the age of eighteen, be it through coercion or through their own volition. Data show that 14.18% of married Indonesian women are younger than 16 years old (SUSENAS, 2017); with 1.459,000 teenage girls marrying per annum so that the country ranks eighth globally in terms of teenage marriage (UNICEF, 2020). Using a cybernetics communication approach and qualitative method, this article assesses teenage marriage prevention programs in Rembang, a regency in middle Java, Indonesia. This study found that prevention of teenage marriage is not part of everyday discussion in the grassroots. Public discourse has stalled at the information stage, optimal understanding has yet to be realized. With this backdrop, Rembang regency utilize a top-down approach in organizing its teenage marriage prevention programs. However, synergy and cooperation remain necessary to minimize the practice by maximizing collaboration with families, schools, health officials, religious officials, and civil servants who turn to be the most influential actors in such programs."

Previous research shows that perceived autonomy support is significantly associated with positive health outcomes for different clinical populations. However, there is not a standardized measurement tool that assesses perceived autonomy support for the Turkish population. This study translated the Health Care Climate Questionnaire (HCCQ), a perceived autonomy support measurement tool, into Turkish and investigated the factorial structure of the questionnaire with a group of patients with cancer. This study used a convenience-sampling method with 192 people with cancer. The participants were recruited from a major cancer institute and a non-profit organization in Turkey by research partners. Volunteer participants either filled out a hard copy of a survey packet or completed the survey packet through a secured online survey tool website (i.e., https://www.surveymonkey.com ). In addition, a closed Facebook group for cancer survivors in Turkey was used to advertise the study’s link. The results indicated the participants perceived a moderate level of autonomy support. In comparison to German and US populations, perceived autonomy support was low among Turkish cancer patients. The results also indicated that the HCCQ has a two-factor measurement structure. Correlations with external variables indicated that the scores of HCCQ were significantly positively associated with life satisfaction and quality of life of cancer patients and negatively associated with cancer related symptoms (e.g., fatigue)."

The use of the internet for information-seeking is very prevalent, however sources are of varied quality. We explored the information-seeking behaviour of pregnant women in the context of health literacy skills and informed decision-making. Methods In a mixed-method descriptive study, 12 focus groups with a culturally diverse set of pregnant women and new mothers (N = 62), a non-participant observation study of antenatal education classes and a web-based questionnaire survey were performed (N = 200). The survey explored use and critical appraisal of internet sources of information, perceived role in assisting decision-making, user-provider interaction, alliance and autonomy in decision making. Results Six themes emerged: in a generally “unsupportive system”, pregnant women want to have a “confident voice” but find themselves “self-navigating” in parallel worlds of formal and informal information, using a process of “supplementing and filtering”, sometimes instinctively and selectively, ending up in a state of “doubt and faith” with regards to the trustworthiness of the information and physician dominance in communication, while the “art of communication” is essential to break the cycle. Internet information-searching is very prevalent, even though 60% characterize the information as misleading and 90% would like health professionals to recommend trusted sites. While the majority report discussing this information with their healthcare providers, only 57% characterize the reception as positive. Conclusions Women want to have control over decisions affecting their pregnancy. While the internet is a prevalent information source, they value the communication with their healthcare providers and want direction. Maternity healthcare professionals need to recognize the phenomenon, offer appropriate guidance and support shared decision-making. Key messages “Traditional” antenatal education arrangements are not effective in supporting informed decision-making. In a landscape of prevalent internet use, a shift is needed from current practices of unguided information-searching."

However, limited academic research has been done to validate empirically artificial autonomy and its downstream consequences on human behavior. This study investigates the role of artificial autonomy by dividing it into three types of autonomy in terms of task primitives, namely, sensing, thought, and action autonomy. Drawing on mind perception theory, the authors hypothesize that the two fundamental dimensions of humanlike perceptions—competence and warmth—of non-human entities could explain the mechanism between artificial autonomy and IPA usage. Our results reveal that the comparative effects of competence and warmth perception exist when artificial autonomy contributes to users’ continuance usage intention. Theoretically, this study increases our understanding of AI-enabled artificial autonomy in information systems research. These findings also provide insightful suggestions for practitioners regarding AI artifacts design."

However, meeting these psychological needs can become difficult as adults age. Facebook use has been associated with enhanced relatedness, competence, and autonomy in a student population, but the effect of Facebook use on the psychological needs in older adults has yet to be investigated. Drawing from self-determination theory, we investigated whether Facebook use facilitated older adults’ relatedness, competence, and autonomy needs, and the relationship between these psychological needs and levels of mobility. One hundred and twenty-seven adults ( Mage = 71), completed an online survey that measured Facebook use, relatedness, competence, autonomy, and levels of mobility. More frequent Facebook users reported significantly higher levels of relatedness compared to less frequent Facebook users, and less mobile participants reported significantly lower levels of autonomy and used Facebook significantly more frequently than more mobile participants. The potential of Facebook as a tool to help older adults meet their relatedness needs is discussed. • Self-determination theory posits that feeling related, competent, and autonomous is central to wellbeing. • Meeting these psychological needs can become difficult as adults age. • Facebook could be a tool to help older adults meet their relatedness needs."

Objectives: The study aimed to observe the changes in the scenario of e-learning in Indian Medical Education during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted on 905 undergraduate health science students who agreed with an online survey. A questionnaire was prepared, including sociodemographic details, utilization of commercially available e-learning programs before the pandemic, and the scenario of teaching-learning activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was validated and circulated among medical students of various states across India through social media. Qualitative data were presented as numbers and percentages and quantitative data as mean (SD). Results: Of the 905 students surveyed, 69.17% (n = 626) were female students and 30.83% (n = 279) were male students. Besides, 85% (n = 395) of the students found commercial programs useful in clarifying concepts. Institutional e-learning was mandatory for 71.16% (n = 644) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the 644 students for whom e-learning was mandatory, 69.10% (n = 445) found tools like videoconferencing, Google classroom, zoom meetings, etc. useful in flexibility and autonomy. However, 50.47% (n = 325) of the students preferred a combined method of classroom teaching and e-learning, whereas only 9.93% (n = 64) of students preferred only e-learning as a method of teaching. They were satisfied with institutional programs for clarifying concepts (n = 386; 60%) and communication skills (n = 320; 50%). Conclusions: The utility of e-learning has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, students preferred e-learning in combination with traditional teaching, especially in health science courses."

Workers can sign up to a work platform – a website or smartphone program that manages the work automatically – and take on work at the tap of a button. Some platforms manage labour, such as driving for Uber or delivering food for Deliveroo, while others manage retail activity, such as Ebay or Etsy.<br/> Recent research has shown that a significant number of people are using platform work to earn money, with over half being young people aged 16-34. While there are some data regarding satisfaction levels and attractors, there is little research examining specific age segments of workers, or the relationship between platform work and career.<br/> Using data from focus group interviews with school and Further Education college students, this paper will discuss findings from research investigating how young people in England aged 16-19 perceive the gig economy and whether they feel that it will be relevant to their careers, with a view to discussing whether it may be necessary to include in careers education programmes or guidance.<br/> The interview data indicate that these participants were occasionally using platforms to make money, and a few were earning regularly, usually on retail platforms. While some interviewees appreciated the autonomy and flexibility promised by gig economy work, the uncertainty, perceived low status, and lack of career progression prevented them from taking it seriously as a career option. Instead, they preferred traditional forms of work that provide more stability and organisational support - an increasingly rare commodity in a labour market that is changing rapidly in the opposite direction. We conclude that while there may be little value in giving detailed individual guidance on the gig economy, it could be valuable to use it as a way of teaching young people about the labour market and different types of employment"

Athletes are therefore bound by the same sporting rules. This also applies to minor athletes who compete at the highest level of their sport. The disciplinary autonomy of sports governing bodies enables them to initiate sports investigations against minor athletes alleged of being in violation of sports regulations, including those pertaining to doping and match manipulation. During the investigations, minor athletes may be obliged to attend sports interrogations or grant full access to diverse of personal information and documentary evidence, including mobile phones, emails, SMS and WhatsApp conversations, and health records. However, the vulnerability of young athletes requires sufficient protection of minors and safeguards in sports investigation proceedings. The aim of this article is to examine the legality of internal sports investigation proceedings against minors in respect to doping and manipulation of sports competition matters. In particular, it analyses whether it is legitimate and reasonable to use investigative measures contained in the regulations of sports governing bodies against minor athletes in the light of the principle of proportionality."

The introduction of 5G technology in Europe can build on an existing framework of electronic communications legislation which were adopted in the internal market harmonisation competences regulated in the legal base provided in art.114 TFEU. However, as revealed by the EU’s policy documents, 5G technology, as well as its suppliers, represent considerable internal security risks and pose a threat to Europe’s technological sovereignty and autonomy. The EU reacted to these challenges by securitising and politicising its 5G policy. These developments question whether its implementation can take place in internal market competences, and whether the EU alone possesses sufficient competences to secure implementation."

Schmitt \nThis article explores the intersection of autonomous cyber capabilities and two primary rules of international law—the respect for the sovereignty of other States and the prohibition on coercive intervention into another State’s internal or external affairs. Of all the rules of international law, these are the likeliest to be violated through employment of cyber capabilities, whether autonomous or not. This raises the question of whether a cyber operation that involves autonomous capabilities presents unique issues with respect to the application of the two rules. The article concludes that while there are numerous unsettled issues surrounding their application to cyber operations, the fact that a cyber operation employs autonomous capabilities has little legal bearing on the resolution of those issues. Rather, autonomy simply makes it more difficult, at least at times, to confidently apply the rules because of the uncertainty as to the consequences. Yet, these are dilemmas of fact, not law, and must be understood and acknowledged as such."

Participants included 439 Grades 7–11 adolescents (242 girls) from five secondary schools in Hong Kong. Moderation analyses were conducted controlling for adolescents sex. No strengthening effects were found between maternal × paternal control and maternal × paternal autonomy-support in relation to bullying victimization experiences. No buffering effect of parental autonomy-support was evident in the association between parental control and traditional bullying victimization. However, high levels of paternal autonomy-support were associated with more frequent reports of cyberbullying victimization at high levels of maternal control but not low levels. A similar pattern emerged for maternal autonomy-support and paternal control. These findings imply that inconsistent parenting might increase adolescents’ likelihood for cyberbullying victimization."

As processes are enhanced with sensor and actuator technology, they become digitally interconnected and merge into an Internet of Things (IoT) to form cyber-physical systems (CPS). Using these automated systems, enterprises can improve the performance and quality of their operations. However, currently it is neither feasible nor reasonable to equip any machine with full autonomy when networking with other machines or people. It is necessary to specify rules for machine behavior that also determine an adequate degree of autonomy to realize the potential benefits of the IoT. Yet, there is a lack of methodologies and guidelines to support the design and implementation of machines as explicit autonomous agents such that many designs only consider autonomy implicitly. To address this research gap, we perform a comprehensive literature review to extract 12 requirements for the design of autonomous agents in the IoT. We introduce a set of constitutive characteristics for agents and introduce a classification framework for interactions in multi-agent systems. We integrate our findings by developing a conceptual modeling language consisting of a meta model and a notation that facilitates the specification and design of autonomous agents within the IoT as well as CPS: the Autonomy Model and Notation. We illustrate and discuss the approach and its limitations."

In the implementation of b-MOOCs, learning support or scaffolding proves to be essential and determines to some extent the success of blended learning, while available literature shows lack of re-search on it. Aiming at exploring a feasible learning support approach for b-MOOCs in practice, this study constructed a support framework with four key elements of resources (R), interaction (I), strategy (S) and evaluation (E) support, briefed as RISE, and implemented it in the Business English course in a Chinese university. A survey and semi-structured interview were conducted to make clear its effects, the perceptions and expectations of students. It shows that the RISE support initiative got wide recognition and resulted in various improvements, promoting learning autonomy, improving learning strategy, increasing interaction and time devoted. As to suggestions, more targeted and higher degree of support is expected by learners and they show preference for face-to-face instruction and suggestion is raised that the proportion of face-to-face section should be no less than the online part. The results of this study may offer practical reference in b-MOOC design about how to support learning process of students and what components and methods are effective."

At the same time, messaging apps blur boundaries by default and contribute to the blending of different relational contexts as well as the collapsing of absence and presence. Whereas existing studies have mainly focused on the blurring of boundaries between work and private life, this study expands beyond the personal/professional binary and considers boundary work in more nuanced relational contexts. In order to provide a better understanding of boundary work within messaging practices, we conducted interviews and focus groups with employees from a variety of Dutch workplaces, and with participants of WhatsApp neighborhood crime prevention groups. Our findings highlight two forms of boundary work strategies. First, respondents purposefully tinker with WhatsApp features to manage the boundaries between absence and presence. Second, they use smartphone and WhatsApp functionalities to carefully construct segmentations between different contexts. The meaning of particular contexts, the materiality of messaging apps, and technical know-how play a crucial role in these boundary-sculpting practices. The importance of our study is in noting how the ongoing contradictions of messaging practices—being always available but always negotiating that availability—affect everyday experiences of freedom, privacy, and autonomy in significant ways."

However, to date, little attention has been paid to understanding the perspectives, needs, expectations, and experiences of potential users with physical activity mobile apps. Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the features that are judged to be important for engagement with a physical activity mobile app and the reasons for their importance. Methods A qualitative focus-group methodology with elements of co-design was adopted in this study. Participants reporting sedentary lifestyles and willingness to improve their physical activity behavior through mobile technology were recruited. The focus group sessions consisted of 13 participants (8 men and 5 women, mean [SD] age 41.9 [7.1] years). Two researchers conducted the data analysis independently by using the inductive thematic approach. Results Four main themes emerged in relation to the research question and were named as follows: “physical activity participation motives,” “autonomy and self-regulation,” “need for relatedness,” and “smart.” Additionally, 2 subthemes originated from “physical activity participation motives” (ie, “medical guidance” and “weight loss and fitness for health”) and “smart” (ie, “action planning” and “adaptable and tailored”). Conclusions Features enhancing autonomy and self-regulation and positively affecting health and physical well-being as well as the need for relatedness, adaptability, and flexibility should be considered as core elements in the engagement of potential users with physical activity mobile apps. The emerged findings may orient future research and interventions aiming to foster engagement of potential users with physical activity apps."

Based on a 16-month ethnography conducted with older people (aged 50–80) in a middle-class district in São Paulo, Brazil, I found that smartphones empower older people to craft a health identity by engaging and producing content that highlights the positive aspects of ageing. In this community, health is a concept deeply associated with productivity, and social media becomes a space for participants to present themselves as busy, giving visibility to all of the activities they engage with. On WhatsApp groups, participants can also work as curators, sharing content that is in the public interest, which improves their collective experience of ageing and restores their sense of utility and dignity. I found that smartphones also allow participants to manipulate the mechanism of social comparison used to classify who is healthy and who is old. Often, when they have a condition or frailty, they confine themselves to online interactions, hiding from view the ageing body that could compromise their performance. By doing that, their declines are kept on the backstage of their social interactions, allowing participants to extend their presence within the third age, which is associated with freedom and autonomy, while the decline related to the fourth age is kept in the shadows."

Digital information and communication technologies have enormous innovation potential for the overall modernization and transformation of education and the enrichment of pedagogical sciences. Realizing this potential requires technologies to be fully integrated into educational practice. A high degree of integration is a prerequisite for the implementation of constructivism, increasing autonomy, personal responsibility of learners and the opportunity for personalized learning.\n Digital technological integration is a progressive change of education to a degree of transformation. In the process of gradual merging of information and communication and pedagogical technologies, innovative pedagogical practices are created, and they cannot be realized without modern technological means. The characteristics of the methods of teaching and learning with digital technologies determine different degrees of integration which are entry, adoption, adaptation, infusion, and transformation.\n The current features of the applied methods for using Information Communication Technology (ICT) in the Bulgarian secondary education in technology, and entrepreneurship (grades 5-7) were studied by surveying 127 pedagogues teaching this subject. A questionnaire is attached examining the goals, frequency use of digital tools in the educational process, and the applied management decisions for choosing the digital tools and working with them. The analysis of the obtained data showed that ICT was used, but the degree of integration was low and corresponded to the initial levels of entry and initial adoption of the integration process. In isolated cases, lessons were held according to how students performed in activities specific to their level of adaptation."

This study is based on a survey of mature undergraduate students in private higher education institutes in the South of England and their experience with online teaching during the COVID-19. The questionnaire was sent out to mature undergraduate students studying in three private higher education institutes, and we received 225 responses. A quantitative approach was used to analyse the results. Majority of students 95% were using online teaching for the first time, and they were novice with the online teaching software (Zoom and Microsoft Teams, etc.). They were provided with training for online teaching, especially how to use the software, and they were satisfied with the training. The study also identified challenges students faced during the online teaching such as weak Internet connection, old devices (computer and laptop etc.) low level of digital competency especially among older students, lack of technical support from the institute and stressful transition period. The final findings from the study indicated that the quick decision of switching to online teaching was right, and the majority of students found online teaching excited. Consequently, the majority of students wanted to continue online teaching after the COVID-19 because it provides ease and convenience, no travelling time & cost, freedom and autonomy. The online teaching training for students could be made more effective, and private higher education institutions could also address challenges such as weak Internet connection and old devices (computer, laptop, etc.).\n \n <p> </p><p><strong> Article visualizations:</strong></p><p><img src=“/-counters-/edu_01/0724/a.php” alt=“Hit counter” /></p>"

This is imperative in view of superintelligent Al, which may escape human control. The information age poses quandaries regarding the uses and abuses of technology. A major critique concerns the commercial design of digital technologies that engenders compulsive behavior. All technologies affect humans in a reciprocal way. The new digital technologies-from smartphones to the Internet—where humans are tethered to machines, can impair our autonomy, hijack attention, rewire the brain, and diminish concentration, empathy, knowledge, and wisdom. The remedy is to restore deep reading, human interactions, personal conversations, real friendships, and respect for autonomy and privacy, building a nurturing culture of tolerance, coupled with transcendent norms and ideals worthy of a creature created in the image and likeness of God. This aspiration should be at the center of a new interdisciplinary field of inquiry—a phenomenology of communications."

Paterson \nThis study extends our understanding of humble leadership as an important trust-engendering leadership style that influences employee behaviors. Drawing on social exchange theory, we articulate how humble leaders’ employee-centric behaviors signal trust and facilitate a social exchange relationship between leaders and followers. Specifically, we posit that a leader’s humble leadership behaviors are positively related to employees’ task performance and organizational citizenship behavior via feelings of being trusted by one’s supervisor. We also predict that the interaction between humble leadership and employee job autonomy will influence employees’ appraisal of feeling trusted. We tested our moderated-mediation model using experimental vignette data and three-wave survey data collected from 233 employees and their supervisors working at a large Chinese internet company. Study results support our hypotheses that humble leadership, and its interaction with employee job autonomy, contribute to feeling trusted by their supervisor. Furthermore, we found that humble leadership behavior, via enhanced perceptions of feeling trusted, predicted supervisor-rated employee task performance and organizational citizenship behavior toward the organization. The implications for theory and practice are discussed."

The present study explores the potential role of adolescents’ time management tendency in mediating the relationship between parenting style and adolescent internet gaming disorder (IGD). Responses from a total of 357 Chinese high school students were collected for a Pathological Video-Game Use Questionnaire, Simplified Parenting Styles Scale, and Time Management Tendency Scale. Overall, participants reported moderate use of online games (Mean = 1.41; SD = 0.41), lower than the median value of 2 on a three-point scale. In terms of the mediating role of adolescents’ time management tendency, full meditation was observed for the relationship between the parenting style factor of “parents’ emotional warmth” for both mothers and fathers and internet gaming disorder. The results highlight the benefits of emotional warmth in supporting self-efficacy, self-control, and autonomy through the promotion of time management, which is an important protective factor for IGD and can serve as a mediating personality variable. Although non-significant in the complete model, over-protection and rejection by parents should also be cautiously considered as potential risk factors related to addiction."

We start with a short review of discourses on choice and choicelessness and then shift to the emerging era of technology-shaped choice processes that are especially observable in contemporary hyperdigital marketspaces. For the increasingly large swaths of market segments that consume, indeed live, digitally, we find deft symbolic sublimations and inversions happening, wherein manipulation is perceived as autonomy enhancing."

Based on semi-structured interviews with administrators, faculty, IT specialists and students, it is argued that in the force majeure circumstances the university offers for DE a standard model of one-size-fits-all curriculum though modified through information and communication technologies. The use of the Internet in a localized online space is limited to delivering courses without considering needs of individual learners, their autonomy, preferences and prior knowledge of the subject. The observation method was used by both participant and non-participant. An experiment on the teachers’ self-assessment proves that many still view the university as a source of offline information for students. The article purports to discuss ways to promote DE by the concepts of postindustrial educational space connectivism, hyperconnectivity of social networks, teachers’ reflective practice, digital nativity of teachers and students in mastering information and communication technologies. It is claimed that real transition of a Russian university to DE cannot be achieved without internet-provided increased transactional distance in the dialogue between the teacher and students mediated by technology and reflective approach."

These discussions, particularly those taking place among States that are Parties to the 1980 Certain Conventional Weapons Convention, reveal a complete lack of consensus on the requirement of human control and serve to distract from the more important question with respect to autonomy in armed conflict: under what conditions could autonomous weapons “select” and “attack” targets in a manner that complies with the law of armed conflict (LOAC).\nThis article analyzes the specific LOAC rules on precautions in attack, as codified in Article 57 of Additional Protocol I, and asserts that these rules do not require human judgment in targeting decisions. Rather, these rules prescribe a particular analysis that must be completed by those who plan or decide upon an attack prior to exercising force, including decisions made by autonomous systems without meaningful human control. To the extent that autonomous weapons and weapons systems using autonomous functions can be designed and employed in such a way to comply with all required precautions, they would not violate the LOAC. A key feature of determining the ability of autonomous weapons and weapons systems using autonomous functions to meet these requirements must be a rigorous weapons review process."

Analysis with fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) interrogates two propositions to identify recipes. Proposition 1 indicates that autonomy is not a necessary ingredient for either culture; self-presentation in the virtual world need not mirror the true self to provide short-term virtual satisfaction. Proposition 2 suggests that both cultures value relatedness and competence as motivations for social media behavior. While Americans value interactivity more than their counterparts, Spaniards value competence more, to experience social media networking satisfaction. Digital marketing managers must better understand cross-cultural differences and consider virtual value propositions offered to members of various cultures to better navigate the dynamic social media environment."

An online questionnaire survey gathered the views of 169 grandmothers and grandfathers. On the one hand, it asked them generically about their possession of ICTs, their ICT skills, and their family relationships. On the other hand, it asked about their relationship with one of their grandchildren according to the ICTs used and the relational functions performed, particularly in relation to the age of the grandchild chosen. The grandparents who responded to our survey are very well equipped with ICTs and have good ICT skills. They frequently use them for both personal and family use. They communicate with their grandchildren in ways that are adapted to the grandchild’s age and autonomy. These are more intense with the youngest grandchildren, and encourage a resumption of exchanges in later adolescence. While the choice of communication methods depends in part on the age of the grandchild, the relational functions performed seem to be more structured by the developmental stage of the grandchild than by the technical characteristics of ICTs. Our data also confirm that while ICTs can make it possible to maintain a link with grandchildren who live far away, they mainly enrich an otherwise existing relationship."

Design/methodology/approach A survey was developed based on construct measures from the literature. A total of 316 responses were received from employees of information and communication technology companies located in China’s Pearl River Delta. Findings Both ethical leadership and job autonomy have a positive impact on employee creative deviance; job autonomy plays a mediating role between ethical leadership and creative deviance; creative self-efficacy does not have a significant moderating effect on the job autonomy-creative deviance relationship. Research limitations/implications Future studies could explore the potential moderating role of both job autonomy and creative-self efficacy in the link between ethical leadership and creative deviance. Practical implications This study recommends that organizations should adopt and promote an ethical leadership approach to manage creative deviance at work. Organizations could explore alternative methods of task completion to support the job autonomy for the employees to mitigate the dilemmas associated with creative deviance. Originality/value This is one of few studies that examine the impact of ethical leadership on employee’s creative deviance, despite the fact that the influence of ethical leadership on the followers has been extensively examined."

During SPD projects, different kinds of mechanisms can be applied to organize the SDs. Some of them tend to be centralized control (e.g. crowdsourcing design) and some are more of distributed autonomy (e.g. opensourcing design). Both centralized control and distributed autonomy have their strengths and limitations for SPD. Centralized control enables more organized, focused, and efficient project execution, but it limits the emergence of collective intelligence among the SDs. Distributed autonomy helps to explore the innovation potential of SDs by granting them the freedom of communication and mutual inspiration, but it may cause the problem of unreliable and unpredictable design process. To complement the advantages of centralized control and distributed autonomy in SPD, an integrated model of Blackboard and Bayesian network is established in this paper. The Blackboard, whose Control modules are specially customized for human Knowledge sources, is for guaranteeing overall control of the distributed design process and at the same time permitting certain level of autonomy to the SDs. The Bayesian network, built with an improved Bayesian causal map method, is an embedded Control module of the Blackboard which evaluates design solutions according to the incomplete collective judgments from SDs. The operability of the integrated model has been verified through a case study of 3D printer conceptual design project."

Annaswamy \nThe 21st century is witnessing large transformations in several sectors related to autonomy, including energy, transportation, robotics, and health care. Decision making using real-time information over a large range of operations (as well as the ability to adapt online in the presence of various uncertainties and anomalies) is the hallmark of an autonomous system. To design such a system, a variety of challenges must be addressed. Uncertainties may occur in several forms, both structured and unstructured. Anomalies may often be severe and require rapid detection and swift action to minimize damage and restore normalcy. This article addresses the difficult task of making autonomous decisions in the presence of severe anomalies. While the specific application of focus is flight control, the overall solutions proposed are applicable for general complex dynamic systems."

Despite ICTs having positive benefits for the maintenance of long-distance intimacies, digital asymmetries characterized by gaps in routines, emotional experiences, and outcomes of ICT use can also emerge between family members of different structural, social, and geographical conditions. Drawing on an innovative “content–context diary”-cum-participant observation, this article investigates the multi-dimensional digital asymmetries emerging from the transnational communication of Chinese “study mothers” in Singapore. Using the data visualization and analysis tool “ecomap,” the findings uncover that study mothers were largely beleaguered by expectation asymmetry and autonomy asymmetry, arising from different expectations to and control over daily transnational communication with their family members. The study mothers were disadvantaged by their relatively isolated life situations in the host society and accentuated gender hierarchies in the household."

    "text": "Doc 1281 :  Social Media Manipulation, Autonomy and Capabilities \nhttps://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3710786\n Sylvie Delacroix \nTo understand why social media platforms’ potency as a tool for manipulation is inadequately apprehended through content-neutral, autonomy-focused analyses, this paper starts with an overview of the structural conditions that allowed such platforms to acquire their considerable regulatory power. Among these conditions, two elements stand out: the hidden -rather than non-deliberative- influence as well as its precise and comprehensive scope. While the hidden influence is what sets social media apart from other, non-manipulatory tools of influence, it is the comprehensive scope that exposes the limits of ‘value-neutral’ autonomy-based frameworks. When we are manipulated into acquiring a certain trait, there is normally enough left of us that is free of manipulatory influence to anchor some after-the-fact endorsement or alienation test. As an alternative to ‘value-neutral’ autonomy-based analyses, this paper analyses the harm that stems from such systematic manipulation through a capability account of autonomy. Of all the capabilities that are essential to what von Humboldt would call ‘self-realisation’, the capacity to imagine oneself as a different person is critical. It is also the capability that is most endangered by social media’s drive to optimise our online (and offline) environment to maximise user engagement."

The authors note that the image of a woman in the gender media is changing due to the changes in the global and local agenda, in particular, due to the changes in the position of a woman in the family, the structure of a family, and decreasing of the number of family members. These transformations can also be explained by the change in the state’s requests for the promotion of a certain image, for example, the image of a patriotic woman during the Second World War and a mother woman in the post-war period. Over the course of many historical periods, rubrics devoted to the arrangement of everyday life, the relationship of the sexes, health and beauty, and motherhood remain the traditional rubrics of women’s publications. During more than two hundred years of publications, the image of a woman in them has gone through stages from primordial patriarchal models through a surge of individualization and independence to a moderate combination of the role of the homemaker and the installation of autonomy from men. The article also outlines the main trends in the development of modern women’s online publications, which, on the one hand, have inherited the theme and structure of traditional women’s magazines, and on the other, have the features of blogs. If certain characteristic images of a woman in the press gain or lose relevance, the changes in the family model in women’s media can be considered irreversible: there is no return to the image of a patriarchal multi-generational family. The study was based on the methods of historical review, thematic analysis and content analysis of publications of women’s magazines of various historical periods. Keywords: women’s periodicals, the history of women’s periodicals, the image of a woman in the media, media images, gender identity, family model, women’s online media"

This measure includes data localisation measure. To enhance the digital business environment, ASEAN Member States in 2019 signed the ASEAN Agreement on E-Commerce (AAoE) containing a commitment to e-commerce liberalisation in the region. This research will analyse data localisation measure-related provisions found in AAoE. It addresses the following central question, whether data localisation measure-related provisions in ASEAN Agreement on E-Commerce can achieve balance between e-commerce liberalisation and the protection of societal interest in the ASEAN region. This research concludes that protection of important societal interests is attained by the AAoE. However, the structure of the AAoE in general is not in balance between the liberalisation and protection of important interest as such, but more to leaning towards the preservation of the state’s regulatory autonomy on data flow."

In the Anglo-Saxon context, this wave is often referred to as the ‘internet of things’, while in Germany and other European countries, where the digitalization of production and distribution is at the centre of the debate, this operates under the term ‘Industry 4.0’. These terms not only describe the digitalization of horizontal and vertical value chains of companies, but also formulate a vision of the future that promises new market and export opportunities as well as a new ecologically sustainable way of doing business. It is assumed that a ‘new spirit of capitalism’ will allow for a certain margin of autonomy and non-hierarchical cooperation not only between firms and workers but also with the so-called ‘prosumers’, a term designed to catch the convergence of boundaries between consumers and producers, and referring to the unpaid – and usually unaware – work of the internet user. Some pundits like Paul Mason go so far as to imagine that the fourth industrial revolution might provide not only a technologically inspired route out of fossil fuel dependence, but would more generally free us from capitalist imperatives. Others are more sceptical about the promises of digitalization, either pointing to various technological bottlenecks that stand in the way of a widespread use of digital infrastructure, or stressing the corporate crusade against data governance (just getting started), or questioning whether the digital economy can be placed at the service of ecological sustainability. This essay attempts to subject the digitalization hype, especially how far digitalization can be linked to societal goals in favour of workers, to a critical assessment."

These protests have many aspects in common, while at the same time there is a certain historic continuity connecting them to previous protests, with which they also have much in common. What makes them new, however, is a hybrid nature that combines street protest and online action, making them similar to protests occurring in other parts of the world during the same period. Based on a literature review and field work on three countries, Senegal, Burkina Faso, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, this article addresses some of the main features of what some authors have called the “third wave of African protests.” The study points out how the digital environment is galvanizing a new process of popular opposition and enabling both greater autonomy for actors promoting the protests and greater interaction at the regional level. With the sociopolitical impact in the short and medium term still uncertain, the third wave of African protests is giving birth to a new political and democratic culture in the region as a whole."

This study addresses circumstances when perceived support helps and when it hurts work performance, depending on the mediating effects of job autonomy, intrinsic motivation and job satisfaction under the boundary conditions of perceived helpfulness of social media platforms and felt stress. Design/methodology/approach This study collected data using a questionnaire protocol that was adapted and refined from the original scales in existing studies. The sample consists of 900 employees from the public healthcare industry in Vietnam. To test the hypotheses, the partial least squares (PLS) technique was used. Findings This study finds that job autonomy, intrinsic motivation and job satisfaction are important for the perceived support and work performance relationship in which perceived helpfulness of social media platforms plays a critical confounding role. The findings also confirm that felt stress negatively moderates the relationship between job satisfaction and work performance, weakening the effect job satisfaction has on employee work performance. Originality/value This study specifies the boundary conditions under which work performance is mostly affected while enhancing the understanding of how to reinforce intrinsic motivation and job satisfaction. The findings offer organizational and human resource management (HRM) scholars and practitioners a closer look at perceived helpfulness of social media platforms and support the suggestions that autonomy-supportive workplaces are superior."

By administering a survey to 125 students of the English Language Education Program in a State Islamic University in West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia, using 26 items of a questionnaire with a five-point Likert scale, this study unravelled students’ responses in terms of three constructs including Perceived Usefulness (PU), Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) and Perceived Instructor Characteristics (PIC). The findings suggested that in terms of PU, even though the data mostly demonstrated neutral responses for most of the questionnaire items, the students tended to perceive online learning as to provide flexible time for their learning and foster their autonomy/independence and confidence. However, the students tended to perceive online learning as less facilitating for their understanding of subjects. In terms of PEOU, the responses reflected the students’ readiness to employ online learning as the data suggested that they possessed both the technology and the knowledge to use it. However, they tended to encounter problems when operating the technology, especially concerning the internet connection. On the other hand, these students perceived instructor characteristics as mostly positive. Therefore, online learning seemed to have not been designed to engage all students, yet seemed to be an inevitable option during the outbreak as the report from the interviews demonstrated that F2F classes were still preferred over online learning. Finally, these findings imply the need for redesigning online learning to better engage students in virtual classes."

In order to achieve this purpose, we characterize some of the paths on which this knowledge is disseminated and explain how it relates to written culture, educational processes and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). In addition, it opens a space for reflection on the matter in Venezuela in recent years; supported by Bravo (2011) and Uzcátegui and Bravo (2017) reviews of official data. It is emphasized that literacy is decisively linked to the construction of the personal autonomy necessary for lifelong learning and the consideration of reading and writing as social and cultural practices. In conclusion, it is considered that all entities and social actors should assume the commitment to literacy and the promotion of written culture, in its different formats and modalities. In this case, democratic governments’ responsibility of implementing cultural, educational, social and economic policies is underlined, for their implementation increases responsibility towards the people, and also, towards their living conditions."

Particularly, the relation of ICT with capability enhancement, the relation of ICT and ODL mode of higher education learners, and the relation of ICT and capability with student learning has been explored in this paper. Theoretically, capability enhancement has been discussed in terms of connectivism and learner autonomy. Moreover, the theories of capability enhancement as interpreted by Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum have also been used to discuss this issue. Besides contributing to quality human life, ICT is found to be helpful in promoting good behavior and attitudes, increasing their ability toward being, doing, and functioning.

The exponential increase in the complexity of next-generation wind turbines requires artificial intelligence (AI) to operate the machines efficiently and consistently. Evolving the current Industry 4.0 digital twin technology beyond a sole aid for the human decision-making process, the digital twin in the proposed system is used for highly effective training of the AI through machine learning. Human intelligence (HI) is elevated to a supervisory level, in which high-level decisions made through a human–machine interface break the autonomy, when needed. This paper also identifies and elaborates key enabling technologies (KETs) that are essential for realizing the proposed HCPS."

Shyam Sundar \nThis study investigated how older adults’ use of specific features on Facebook is associated with intrinsic motivation and well-being. A content analysis and an online survey were conducted with Facebook users older than 60 years (N = 202). Results showed that profile customization and commenting are positively associated with feelings of autonomy and relatedness, respectively, both predictors of enjoyment on Facebook. Posting photos is positively associated with a feeling of competence, which is related to well-being. The findings advance knowledge about the theoretical mechanisms underlying effects of Facebook use on well-being, and provides design recommendations that address older users’ needs."

The majority of older persons maintain a desire to be valued and useful members of society and of their social networks. Aims We sought to investigate the perception of usefulness among persons aged 65 years and over in four European countries. Methods We performed a cross-sectional survey with a representative sample of individuals aged 65 years or older from the population of retired persons (including recently retired persons and oldest-old individuals) from 4 European countries selected using quota sampling. In February 2016, an internet questionnaire was sent to all selected individuals. The characteristics used for the quota sampling method were sex, age, socio-professional category, region, city size, number of persons in household, autonomy, marital status, place of residence, income and educational status. The questionnaire contained 57 questions. Sociodemographic characteristics were recorded. Responses were analysed with principal components analysis (PCA). Results A total of 4025 persons participated; 51% were males, and 70% were aged 65–75 years. PCA identified six classes of individuals, of which two classes (Classes 2 and 3) were characterized by more socially isolated individuals with little or no sense of usefulness, low self-esteem and a poor sense of well-being. These two classes accounted for almost 20% of the population. Younger and more autonomous classes reported a more salient sense of usefulness. Conclusions The loss of the sense of usefulness is associated with dissatisfaction with life and a loss of pleasure, and persons with profiles corresponding to Classes 2 and 3 should, therefore, be targeted for interventions aimed at restoring social links."

As one example, AI systems in the field of mental health successfully detect signs of mental disorders, such as depression, by using data from social media. These AI depression detectors (AIDDs) identify users who are at risk of depression prior to any contact with the healthcare system. The article focuses on the ethical implications of AIDDs regarding affected users’ health-related autonomy. Firstly, it presents the (ethical) discussion of AI in medicine and, specifically, in mental health. Secondly, two models of AIDDs using social media data and different usage scenarios are introduced. Thirdly, the concept of patient autonomy, according to Beauchamp and Childress, is critically discussed. Since this concept does not encompass the specific challenges linked with the digital context of AIDDs in social media sufficiently, the current analysis suggests, finally, an extended concept of health-related digital autonomy."

    "text": "Doc 1296 :  ‘European Digital Sovereignty’: Successfully Navigating Between the ‘Brussels Effect’ and Europe’s Quest for Strategic Autonomy \nhttps://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3748098\n Theodore Christakis \nThis Study discusses extensively the concept of Digital Sovereignty. It presents the opportunities opened by the concept but also the risks and pitfalls. It provides a panorama of the major debates and developments related to digital/cyber issues in Europe. Here is the Executive Summary of the Study:\n“The Times They Are A-Changin”. When Jean-Claude Juncker, then President of the European Commission, proclaimed in 2018 that “The Hour of European Sovereignty” had come, half of Europe criticized him, recalls Paul Timmers. Today hardly a day goes by in Europe, without a politician talking about “digital sovereignty”.\nFrom a purely normative point of view, the concept makes little sense. It can only further accentuate the classic confusion surrounding the use of the term “sovereignty”, which is one of the most equivocal terms in legal theory and which has been criticized by a famous scholar for often being nothing more than “a catchword, a substitute for thinking and precision”. Still, from a political point of view, “European digital sovereignty” is an extremely powerful concept, broad and ambiguous enough to encompass very different things and to become a “projection surface for a wide variety of political demands”.\nThis study analyses in a detailed way the two understandings of the term: sovereignty as regulatory power; and, sovereignty as strategic autonomy and the ability to act in the digital sphere without being restricted to an undesired extent by external dependencies. While doing so, this study presents a panorama of the most recent le-gislative proposals (such as the Data Governance Act) and the most important debates on digital issues currently taking place at the European level: 5G deployment and cybersecurity concerns; international data transfers and foreign governments’ access to data after SchremsII; cloud computing; the digital services tax; competition law; content moderation; artificial intelligence regulation; and so many others.\nThe first part of this study challenges the sometimes expressed idea that Europe is a somehow “powerless” entity, unable to regulate the digital sphere and big tech companies. Applying Anu Bradford’s concept of “The Brussels Effect”, this study shows that the EU is the most powerful global actor in the field of digital regulation. Far from being normatively irrelevant, Europe has become, through the “Brussels effect”, a “global regulatory hegemon unmatched by its geopolitical rivals”.\nThis does not of course mean that Europe can or needs to regulate everything. There are several limits to what Europe can and wishes to regulate. These are due to internal and external factors. Internally, regulatory action could be blocked by political disagreements among EU Member States; legal obstacles (starting with the national security exemption); or economic considerations - for instance the fear that overregulating AI could hinder innovation and affect competitiveness. Externally, situations of interdependence could render international cooperation necessary in order to avoid retaliation, to find constructive solutions and to resolve conflicts of laws and jurisdiction. This study presents some of the top priorities in the field of international cooperation and builds upon proposals to create “strategic partnerships” with like-minded stakeholders in order to defend certain democratic values and human rights in cyberspace.\nThe second part of this study focuses on digital sovereignty as strategic autonomy. The EU quest for strategic autonomy in the digital sphere is based on a series of legitimate concerns, including geopolitical considerations and a series of dependencies, the significance of which has been exacerbated by recent important developments such as the US-China “tech war” or the Covid-19 crisis. These concerns have led to initiatives which open opportunities for Europe. However, they also entail potential pitfalls. The EU and Member States should carefully study the risks and successfully navigate around them or, at least, take decisions in an informed way, after sufficiently weighing the potential negative impact of a specific measure.\nEurope should first of all undertake to draw the fine line between restrictions based on legitimate reasons (such as compelling cybersecurity or privacy/data protection considerations) and unjustified protectionist measures. Before engaging in anything resembling the latter, Europe should examine the risks posed by such measures.\nAnother area where much more study is necessary are the current calls for “data localisation” and the idea that “European data must be stored and processed in Europe”. Greater understanding of the stakes is necessary: what exactly does “data localisation” mean at a technical level? What are the exact reasons behind the calls to implement such policies in Europe? What are the potential adverse effects and the costs for European companies? What would be the consequences in terms of cybersecurity? And what could be the potential impact on human rights? Data localisation measures, initially promoted by countries like Russia, are now adopted by other countries. NGOs have indicated that this is “alarming” for the future of the free, open and global internet. What would be the message sent to other countries if Europe embraces data localisation?\nEuropean calls in favor of data localisation are often motivated by genuine and legi-timate concerns, related to data protection, privacy considerations and the fear of foreign snooping into European personal and industrial data. Nevertheless, it is well known that data protection considerations can sometimes be misused as a vehicle to further domestic business interests and protectionism. The question then is how to distinguish between data protection and data protectionism. This paper advances a series of thoughts and a methodology in order to assess if data localisation is, in specific circumstances, an adequate way to deal with data protection risks. It considers that the critical test should be whether restrictions to transnational data flows are proportionate to the risks presented, taking into account the nature of the data and a series of other considerations. As a conclusion, data localisation could not be a ne-cessary, proportionate or adequate response to serve data protection in cases where the likelihood of foreign access to data is very limited and where other, more satisfactory and less disruptive, solutions exist.\nIn a more general way, this study raises the question of what model Europe wishes to promote. An increasing number of voices in Europe are calling for it to imitate certain Chinese policies. For years, Europe has been criticizing Chinese protectionism as well as the “Chinese model” of the internet, a model based on firewalls, surveillance and control. How could Europe avoid policy inconsistency and contradiction if it enters into a “The Chinese do it, we will do it” approach?\nThe study concludes that Europe has important and hard choices to make in order to achieve strategic autonomy. The “European digital sovereignty” debate is a useful way to inform policy-makers and citizens and to enable decision-making based not on emotions, but on careful risk-assessment and thorough analysis of the issues involved."

The modernised version of Convention 108 seeks to respond to the challenges posed, in terms of human rights, by the use of new information and communication technologies. This article presents a detailed analysis of this new international text. Convention 108+ contains important innovations: it proclaims the importance of protecting the right to informational autonomy and human dignity in the face of technological developments. It consolidates the proportionality requirement for data processing and strengthens the arsenal of rights of the data subjects. It reinforces the responsibility of those in charge of data processing as well as its transparency. It requires notification of security breaches. It strengthens the independence, powers and means of action of the supervisory authorities. It also strengthens the mechanism to ensure its effective implementation by entrusting the Committee set up by the Convention with the task of verifying compliance with the commitments made by Parties."

In the postindustrial economy, the ideology of labor organization is changing. At the dawn of postindustrialization, such concepts as «decent work», «humanization of labor», «rotation of work», «development of human resources», «enrichment of labor», etc. are widely used. At the same time, the trends of «professionalization of labor» and its autonomy began to appear. Step by step, the multi-disciplinary nature of labor grew, when from the post-operative Taylorist-Ford organization of labor began to move to a multi-operational, based on the combination of functions and professions. The emphasis is on creating holistic models of attractive decent work, reducing the distance between different categories of employees, primarily managers and workers. Unlike in the past, prevention, repair and reprogramming of equipment is assigned to the main staff. This indicates a flexible organization of not only production, but also labor. Thus, the employee is freed from the «dictates of machines» and bureaucratic instruction, and is given the freedom to choose decisions and actions while increasing responsibility and risk for the successful performance of work. It becomes the main link in the technological process. When creating new jobs, it is also necessary to take into account the fact that the employee entering the labor market is changing today. The quality of the labor force is improving: the employee’s educational level and competence are growing, and the process of development and training becomes continuous throughout life. The professional space of the employee is also developing, which is manifested in the emergence of new, sometimes hybrid professions related to receiving, transmitting, and processing information in its various forms and ensuring the sustainable development of the information environment. There is a transformation of the place and role of the employee in social production. These changes allow us to speak about the formation of a new type of employee, characterized by a high educational level, knowledge of information and communication technologies (ICT), having the skills to work with complex intellectual equipment, independent and creative thinking, activity and responsibility in their actions, high ability to self-organization, based on creativity in work, that is, the employee becomes creative. The new nature of work, manifests itself, on one side of individualization, it characterizes the weakening of relations of the employee with a certain social environment (workers become more mobile and less dependent on the firms in which they work), the conclusion of individual labour agreements, the personification of the system of motivation of personnel, and on the other – to increase the creative content of the work and turning it into a means of human self-realization. In this regard, the nature of employee management changes, since it becomes not only the object of management, but also its subject – an individual developing within a certain cultural tradition. Talent management, in contrast to HR processes, through which the operational management of personnel is carried out, focuses special attention on employees as the most important single asset that has a strategic focus. The article discusses the search for talented employees in the organization, highlights the characteristic features of modern approaches to managing them (employees), and in particular, the tools for this work, which are constantly being improved."

Through analyzing North American Internet safety materials and Canadian luring case law, the author finds that on the one hand risks of luring are generalized and on the other limited only to victims under the age of consent. The result is that very often older youth are made responsible for their own victimization, while younger ones are assumed to be victimized and hence denied avenues to sexual expression. By neglecting to analyze online interactions for the dynamics of exploitation, we do a disservice to older youths who are exploited while denying sexual autonomy to youth under the age of consent."

    "text": "Doc 1301 :  The Role of the Rule of Law in Virtual Communities \nhttp://eprints.qut.edu.au/37850/\n Nicolas Suzor \nThere is a severe tendency in cyberlaw theory to delegitimize state intervention in the governance of virtual communities. Much of the existing theory makes one of two fundamental flawed assumptions: that communities will always be best governed without the intervention of the state; or that the territorial state can best encourage the development of communities by creating enforceable property rights and allowing the market to resolve any disputes. These assumptions do not ascribe sufficient weight to the value-laden support that the territorial state always provides to private governance regimes, the inefficiencies that will tend to limit the development utopian communities, and the continued role of the territorial state in limiting autonomy in accordance with communal values. In order to overcome these deterministic assumptions, this article provides a framework based upon the values of the rule of law through which to conceptualise the legitimacy of the private exercise of power in virtual communities. The rule of law provides a constitutional discourse that assists in considering appropriate limits on the exercise of private power. I argue that the private contractual framework that is used to govern relations in virtual communities ought to be informed by the values of the rule of law in order to more appropriately address the governance tensions that permeate these spaces. These values suggest three main limits to the exercise of private power: that governance is limited by community rules and that the scope of autonomy is limited by the substantive values of the territorial state; that private contractual rules should be general, equal, and certain; and that, most importantly, internal norms be predicated upon the consent of participants."

For 2017, it reported that half of the world’s countries scored lower than the previous year. This included the United States, which was demoted from “full democracy” to “flawed democracy.” The principal factor was “ero-sion of confidence in government and public institutions.” Interference by Russia and voter manipulation by Cambridge Analytica in the 2016 presi-dential election played a large part in that public disaffection.\nThreats of these kinds will continue, fueled by growing deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) tools to manipulate the preconditions and levers of democracy. Equally destructive is AI’s threat to decisional and informa-tional privacy. AI is the engine behind Big Data Analytics and the Internet of Things. While conferring some consumer benefit, their principal function at present is to capture personal information, create detailed behavioral profiles and sell us goods and agendas. Privacy, anonymity and autonomy are the main casualties of AI’s ability to manipulate choices in economic and political decisions.\nThe way forward requires greater attention to these risks at the nation-al level, and attendant regulation. In its absence, technology giants, all of whom are heavily investing in and profiting from AI, will dominate not only the public discourse, but also the future of our core values and democratic institutions."

However, there are still many government information systems that are developed and implemented that do not function optimally at both the regional and central government levels. Measuring the level of E-government maturity is needed to determine the extent to which the successful application of E-government is. The purpose of the E-government maturity assessment is to provide basic data, advanced data, and all that is necessary for the development of an E-government strategy. Gartner is one of the models used to measure the maturity level of e-government. Gartner’s model suggests four critical phases of the evolution of e-government, namely: web presence, interaction, transactions, and transformation. The gartner model is used to measure the maturity level in Sukoharjo district. The research methodology used a questionnaire and the calculation used the average score for each dimension. To determine the relationship between dimensions and criteria, the PLS (Partial Least Square) method is used. Research has proven that the maturity level of E-government is 4.06 (predictable process). The dimensions of transformation and usability affect community participation using e-government in Sukoharjo district."

This study examined the relationship between social media use at work and well-being at work for millennials and members of former generations in Finland. The research data contained focus group interviews (N = 52), an expert organization survey (N = 563), and a nationally representative survey (N = 1817). Well-being measures included technostress, burnout, psychological distress, and a set of background variables. Content analysis and linear regression models were used as analysis methods. The results showed that millennials have various intrinsic and extrinsic motivations for social media use at work. Intrinsic motivations included employees’ personal choice and their pure interest to follow the market and discussions in their own field. Extrinsic motivations were related mainly to organizations’ work culture and personal branding. The survey findings revealed, however, that millennials were not only more active social media users for work, but they also experienced higher technostress and burnout than members of former generations. Social media use motivations were associated with both higher and lower technostress and burnout depending on motivation, indicating that social media use can have both positive and negative effects. Overall, our findings suggest that employees tend to utilize social media more if their needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness are fulfilled."

It is conceived as cosmopolitan in nature, universal in application, expertly delivered, and independent of other regulatory systems.This article critiques these qualities attributed to the historical as well as present-day Law Merchant. It disputes that it has evolved ‘spontaneously’ out of merchant practice; that it is uniform in nature; and that it transcends national law. It argues instead that the Law Merchant is often fragmentary in nature and subject to disparate national and transnational influences. It challenges, in particular, unitary conceptions of ‘autonomy’ ascribed to the Law Merchant, presenting a pluralistic conception of Law Merchant ‘autonomy’ instead. It illustrates these arguments in relation to the so-called Cyberspace Law Merchant and to transnational commercial arbitration."

Largely because consent has an almost deferential power as a proxy for consumer choice, organizations increasingly use consent as a de facto standard for demonstrating privacy commitments. The Department of Health and Human Services and the Federal Trade Commission have integrated the concept of consent into health care, research, and general commercial activities. Despite consent’s prominence in U.S. law, this article seeks to understand, more fully, consent’s origins and development, then applies a philosophical-legal lens to clearly identify problems with consent in its current use. Jurgen Habermas’ theory of communicative action as it applies to private and public spheres and Helen Nissenbaum’s model for contextual inquiry provide useful lenses for understanding the impact of consent on human autonomy. This article suggests five resulting problems for human autonomy, the “consent myth,” and four principles for addressing these problems in contemporary health technologies, such as Internet of Health Things (IoHT) and artificial intelligence (AI) applications."

Feldman \nThree philosophical rationales–search-for-truth, self-governance, and self-fulfillment–have animated discussions of free expression for decades. Each rationale emerged and attained prominence in American jurisprudence in specific political and cultural circumstances. Moreover, each rationale shares a foundational commitment to the classical liberal (modernist) self. But the three traditional rationales are incompatible with our digital age. In particular, the idea of the classical liberal self enjoying maximum liberty in a private sphere does not fit in the postmodern information society. The time for a new rationale has arrived. The same sociocultural conditions that undermine the traditional rationales suggest a self-emergence rationale built on the feminist concept of relational autonomy. This novel rationale constitutionally protects expression that fosters the ongoing creative and dynamic process of self-emergence. As such, the rationale justifies protecting expression concerned with the emergent self’s struggle to define itself and the broader culture. The self-emergence rationale has important ramifications, especially for free-expression issues related to the Internet. The Roberts Court has invoked the traditional rationales in granting expansive first-amendment protections to corporations. Many Internet-related issues involve multinational corporations, such as Google, Verizon, and Facebook. But under the self-emergence rationale, publicly held business corporations should not have free-speech rights for two reasons. First, they have fixed rather than emergent natures. Second, they manipulate and limit the sociocultural space available for the autonomous self-emergence of individuals."

This view also promotes individual autonomy, although it does so in a different fashion and – as this paper suggests – perhaps to a greater extent. Privacy laws based on the right to a private life, such as those generally found in European jurisdictions, more accurately reflect the realities of the digital age and properly protect individual privacy online. In combination, protecting autonomy through principles based on human dignity and recognizing that reasonable expectations can have their place in the context of online communities and digital communication – albeit often mediated and less private than some forms of offline communication – would result in more effective individual safeguards and more satisfactory results. Recent decisions of the European Court of Human Rights have laid the theoretical groundwork required for heightened protection of human dignity in these online environments."

Multiple resources can be placed on a site easily accessible 24/7 and computer mediated communication in various forms can supply needed human interaction spaces. But how are these sites used by the local students? Following the path of several individuals in detail can allow more understanding and depth of the precise usage of space. This paper tracks two Arab students exploring and using a newly formed online self-access centre (SAC) for writing or online writing lab (OWL) for the best part of a semester. As an exploratory action research study, it was data driven and multiple data sources were mainly unobtrusive so that the study could proceed very naturally. The choices, learning style, autonomy types and personality differences between the two students suggest a range of support is ideal in an online SAC to cater for individuals in this context, including resources, how to learn, 1-1 asynchronous with advisor (emails), forums, electronic writing raters, and a high profile test. Ongoing action research should help to keep the online facility relevant to needs and open to new ways."

The issue is also practically important because the increasing use of form contracts in the traditional paper world, and particularly in the Internet based business transactions. In the US, the enforceability of contracts of adhesion remains unsettled and the choice of law question in the contracts as such is left unanswered. The article analyzes the nature of contracts of adhesion as opposed to the party autonomy principle in contractual choice of law, and argues that contracts of adhesion do not conform to the basic notion of party autonomy. The article suggests that the choice of law clause in contracts of adhesion shall not take effect unless adherents meaningfully agree. The article proposes a second chance approach for contractual choice of law in contracts of adhesion. The approach is intended to set a general rule that a choice of law clause in an adhesive contract shall not be deemed enforceable prior to affirmation of the true assent of adherent."

The Internet began as a niche tool of engineers and academics, funded by the Department of Defense. Governance was loosely exercised by an insular group of enthusiasts and experts. By the 1990s, as the Internet grew rapidly, control was asserted more directly by the US government. Significant power was delegated to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), a California non-profit. In June 2016, the Obama administration approved ICANN’s proposal for independent management of the critical “naming and numbering” function of the Internet. ICANN — governed by a complex multistakeholder structure that incorporates many non state actors — will directly control what is essentially the address book of the Internet. By delegating more autonomy to ICANN, the US will strengthen multistakeholderism, not just for ICANN, but as a broader principle of global governance. The Internet has been, over the past two decades, a central site of struggle between multistakeholderism and multilateralism. By relinquishing its role as primus inter pares among states, the US seemingly will lose an important source of power over the Internet. And yet even as its power is diminished, the achievement of its preferences will be strengthened. This somewhat paradoxical story has important lessons not only for the exercise of state power over the Internet but also for the evolution of global governance in a time when increasing numbers of nonstate actors across a range of international issues have achieved substantial participatory roles."

Clash between the privacy of children, UNCRC’S evolving capacities principle, and the freedom of commercial expression and speech It seems that the main dilemma in the matter of children participating in reality programs is the clash between two weighty interests: children’s rights and privacy on one hand, and commercial freedoms of expression and speech on the other. We begin with children’s rights, (163) including children’s dignity and the protection of their interests, which are all internationally recognized rights under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC). (164) Among the rights that could harmed are the child’s autonomy (165) and mental health. (166) There is also breach of privacy, (167) an important and internationally recognized value for children, (168) because they experience public emotional turmoil and cannot choose their audience and what to expose. (169) Intense and extensive exposure such as re-runs often results in hurt feelings and damage to the child’s personality. (170) Parents and broadcasters have a duty to protect children’s privacy. (171) Matters of the individual’s right to privacy, such as the prohibition against exposing a medical or emotional condition, or any other information about the individual’s private life, must not debatable. As discussed below, there is disagreement over other forms of violations of privacy. Paragraph 5 of the UNCRC describes the principle of evolving capacities. (172) According to this principle, children have certain inherent rights from the moment they are born, such as the right to food or security. (173) But other rights–autonomous rights–are granted to them gradually, according to their age and abilities, both physical and emotional. (174) This is so they will protected as they age, rather than be abandoned to their (175) Thus, for example, children are protected from being exposed to matters that are not suitable for their age that may cause them harm, supposedly in the name of fulfilling their rights. (176) The evolving capacities principle is also applicable when defining age groups for consent and participation in reality television. At times, children can care less about their privacy than adults. (177) Modern day children are active on the Internet and frequently expose details about themselves on social networks. Therefore, at least at certain ages, it can assumed that they give genuine consent to such exposure, inasmuch as they control it. (178) Children do not give genuine consent when it comes to reality programs because broadcasters sometimes take advantage of their desire to become famous and thus their consent is not real. One must remember that children are not unionized nor are they considered employees, and in most countries there is no specific legislation that protects them. (179) When children expose their lives on a reality program, one must take a more paternalistic approach than one does with adults, and not leave them to their (180) In contrast to social networks, children cannot respond to a broadcast that portrays them in a certain way. This is even more important if the child did not agree to exposed on the program, and it was their parents’ wish that they filmed, as in docu-reality cases or on Nanny 911. The first natural and obvious protection against breaches of privacy is the parents’ and children’s consent, which serves also as contractual consent. It is possible to compare this situation to that of public figures, who are exposed by virtue of the positions they chose. (181) In this comparison, participants in reality programs who chose to exposed should also not have the right to privacy, or they should have only a weaker version of that right because they made their choice and they want to become famous. (182) But the situation is more complex, especially if a child’s consent is uninformed. We must also ask whether the children want to become famous at any cost. …"

This Article argues that fair use law is both more coherent and more predictable than many commentators have perceived once one recognizes that fair use cases tend to fall into common patterns, or what this Article will call policy-relevant clusters. The policies underlie modern fair use law include promoting freedom of speech and of expression, the ongoing progress of authorship, learning, access to information, truth-telling or truth-seeking, competition, technological innovation, and privacy and autonomy interests of users. If one analyzes putative fair uses in light of cases previously decided in the same policy cluster, it is generally possible to predict whether a use is likely to be fair or unfair. Policy-relevant clustering is not a substitute for appropriate consideration of the statutory fair use factors, but provides another dimension to fair use analysis that complements four-factor analysis and sharpens awareness about how the statutory factors, sometimes supplemented by other factors, should be analyzed in particular contexts.Parts I through V mainly provide a positive account of how fair use has been adjudicated in a variety of contexts and suggestions about factors that should be given greater or lesser weight in certain fair use policy clusters. Its articulation of the policy-relevant clusters into which the fair use cases typically fall should not, however, be understood as attempting to limn the outer bounds of fair use or to foreclose the development of new policy-relevant clusters. Part VI offers a more normative account of fair use as an integral and essential part of U.S. copyright law that can, in fact, encompass the wide range of fair uses discussed in the Article. It also recaps the key lessons from this Article’s qualitative assessment of the fair use case law and points to some encouraging trends in recent cases."

The emerging autonomy of AI holds unique potentials of eternal life of robots, AI and algorithms alongside unprecedented economic superiority, data storage and computational advantages. Yet to this day, it remains unclear what impact AI taking over the workforce will have on economic growth. The contemporary trend of slowbalisation is described, as the slowing down of conventional globalization of goods, services and Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) flows; yet at the same time, we still see human migration and air travel as well as data transfer continuing to rise. These market trends of conventional globalization slowing and rising AI-related industries are proposed as first market disruption in the wake of the large-scale entrance of AI into our contemporary economy. Growth in the artificial age is then proposed to be measured based on two AI entrance proxies of Global Connectivity Index and The State of the Mobile Internet Connectivity 2018 Index, which is found to be highly significantly positively correlated with the total inflow of migrants and FDI inflow – serving as evidence that the still globalizing rising industries in the age of slowbalisation are connected to AI. Both indices are positively correlated with GDP output in cross-sectional studies over the world."

These programs analyze incoming content, and block the receipt of objectionable material, in particular pornography. Thus, patrons at public libraries are protected from unintentionally (or intentionally) accessing objectionable material, and, in the case of minors, from accessing potentially damaging material. At least, that is the official story. In this paper, I develop three points. (1) I argue that CIPA and ALA are better read as examples of the enforcement of a regime of normative sexuality. The question of minors accessing pornography is only relevant to the official story insofar as it provides a rhetorically persuasive example of deviance from that normative regime. CIPAs full target includes information about topics such as homosexuality and contraception. (2) Rather than (or in addition to) punishing deviances directly, CIPA attempts to constitute a “public” in which such deviancy can never occur in the first place. Hence, the designation of a “public” space serves to domesticate alternative sexualities and to sanitize that space of sexual difference. (3) This interaction at the border of the public and private spheres offers an opportunity to reflect on and underscore the ways that subject formation and subjectivity are mediated through technological artifacts like the Internet."

But it’s the organization of and ultimately the knowledge and intelligence we extract from the information we receive that really matters. It can show us the areas of greatest non-compliance … and thereby, contributes to more efficient and effective compliance programs. –IRS Commissioner Doug Schulman (2011) (1) Every animate and inanimate object on earth will soon be generating data, including our homes, our cars, and, yes, even our bodies. –The Human Face of Big Data (2012) (2) Introduction Although the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has always been an information intensive agency, (3) its information-gathering never been the focus of privacy scholars. Those scholars have instead focused on agencies such as the National Security Administration (NSA). (4) But the IRS’s legal claim to private information is remarkable. It is entitled to collect information about who sleeps how often in your house, (5) your hobbies, (6) your reading preferences, (7) your religious affiliation, (8) your travel plans, (9) your weight and your doctor’s recommendations about it, (10) your spouse or your dependent’s abortion, sterilization, (11) or gender identity disorder, (12) and if you were considering a carnal quid pro quo when you made a gift to your mistress. (13) Yet, privacy scholars have taken no note of the IRS’s extraordinary legal claim to such information. From the reverse angle, despite the information-intensive aspects of tax law, tax scholars have not taken note of the increasing pervasiveness of information technology. (14) Modern technologies are creating minutely detailed records of our existence, (15) increasingly facilitating the persistent, continuous and indiscriminate monitoring of our daily lives. (16) One information privacy scholar described the radical and technological transformation of personal information: The small details that were once captured in dim memories or fading scraps of paper are now preserved forever in the digital minds of computers, vast databases with fertile fields of personal data…. Every day, rivulets of information stream into electronic brains to be sifted, sorted, rearranged, and combined in hundreds of different ways. Technology enables the preservation of the minutia of our everyday comings and goings, of our likes and dislikes, of who we are and what we are…. It is ever more possible to create an electronic collage that covers much of a person’s life–a life captured in records, a digital biography composed in the collective computer networks of the world. (17) A prominent national security advisor predicted that by 2040, all of our daily activities will be known by governmental and corporate pursuing the gush of data from the internet of things. (18) As we move towards such a future, the IRS most likely will be among those entities pursuing this growing gush of data. This Article suggests an agenda for discussion among privacy and tax law scholars: issues we ought to consider, research we ought to pursue, and debates we ought to have. In Part I of this Article, I describe the flow of tax-relevant information from taxpayers and third parties to the IRS. …"

Present study focuses on artistic activism: socially sensitive artists publish their creation on the internet on its most interactive space – social media.

The analysis is aimed at Hungarian and Romanian online artistic projects from Transylvania region of Romania, relevant as intercultural communication endeavours. Our research question is the way they differ from the traditional artistic paradigm."

Twomey \nThis article analyzes the extent to which, under federal law, employers may legally monitor employee telephone and email communications that take place on company equipment. Employers may desire to monitor (intercept, record and listen to) employee telephone conversations and email communications, in the ordinary course of business in order to evaluate employee performance or customer satisfaction, or document transactions between employees and vendors, or to meet security, efficiency or other needs. Email is now the default mode of communication in the workplace, and while employers note its efficacy, employees typically have a different view of employer monitoring, and this article discusses how courts reconcile the competing interests of employers in business performance, with employees’ desire for privacy and autonomy."

Drones, cyber operations, and other technological advances in weaponry already allow the United States to intervene militarily with minimal boots on the ground, and increased autonomy in weapon systems will further reduce risk to soldiers. As human troops are augmented and supplanted by robotic ones, it will be politically easier to justify using force, especially for short-term military engagements. Accordingly, one of the remaining incentives for Congress to check presidential warmongering—popular outrage at the loss of American lives—will diminish. The integration of autonomous weapon systems into U.S. military forces will therefore contribute to the growing concentration of the war power in the hands of the Executive, with implications for the international doctrine of humanitarian intervention."

It was particularly appealing to women lawyers as it was thought that if a balance could be effected between work and life, satisfying careers and the raising of children could be combined. The key to effecting this balance, it was believed, was flexible work. Technology has facilitated this flexibility as all that is required is a computer, or other device with internet connection, and a mobile phone. Provided that the firm is agreeable, the lawyer would have a degree of autonomy in determining when and where the work is carried out. However, flexible work has not always proved to be the boon that it was hoped, as the shift from face-to-face time to virtual time has blurred the boundary between work and life, insidiously extending the hours of work and impinging on the realm of intimacy. Drawing on a web-based survey and interviews with lawyers Australia-wide, this article considers the ramifications of perpetual connectivity for lawyers in private practice, with particular regard to its gender significance.

These individual creators are increasingly harnessing law - insisting on ownership of their rights and controlling the ways in which those rights are licensed to others. Facebook users are demanding ownership of their online musings. Scholars are archiving their research online and refusing to assign their copyrights to publishers. Independent musicians are streaming their own songs and operating without record companies. Organizations like the Free Software Foundation are encouraging individual authors to manage their copyrights in innovative ways.When the myriad individual authors empowered by today’s ubiquitous digital technology claim, retain, and manage their own copyrights, they exercise a degree of authorial autonomy that befits the Internet Age. But they simultaneously contribute to a troubling phenomenon I call copyright - the proliferation, distribution, and fragmentation of the exclusive rights bestowed by law, and of idiosyncratic permutations of those rights. The information and transaction costs associated with atomism could hamper future generations of technology-fueled creativity and thus undermine the very purpose of copyright: to encourage the creation and dissemination of works of authorship for the ultimate benefit of the public.In this project I aim to place contemporary atomism in historical and doctrinal context by documenting law’s previous encounters with proliferated, distributed, and fragmented ownership. Along the way I examine how law has encouraged and discouraged atomism and managed its consequences. This history demonstrates the enduring relevance of my concerns within policy, highlights countervailing interests, and provides a framework for thinking about how to alleviate the unfortunate consequences of atomism - and how not to."

With the advent of mobile technology, however, such boundaries can be broken to include external reading materials where students could read and share anytime and anywhere. This paper investigates the role of mobile technology in enhancing Learner Autonomy (LA) in the EFL reading context among students in the Preparatory Year (PY) of Najran University in Saudi Arabia. A reading class of 30 students utilised mobile applications (WhatsApp and internet search engines such as Google) to access external reading materials and interact with their peers and teachers outside the classroom. Qualitative data collection underwent a number of procedures. The baseline data was constructed from the students’ portfolios, which reported the participants’ traditional reading practices and use of mobiles. Then, the participants were encouraged to use internet search engines and WhatsApp group to share their readings. Finally, five participants were interviewed. The data analysis revealed that the participants’ LA is improved through the use of selected mobile applications in terms of taking responsibility for and making decisions about reading materials and the time and place of reading. The study recommends further investigation into the role of mobile applications for generating learners’ own tasks and writing skills."

In Belgium, for example, society has a liberal attitude towards sex and sex education, moreover, sex education is a compulsory practice that offers schools considerable autonomy in the development of curricula, including sex education. Italy is strongly influenced by the Catholic Church, so sex education is controversial in schools, and sex education programs are implemented as part of traditional classroom instruction, focusing mainly on the biological aspects of gender and behavior, adhering to the formation of traditional views on gender issues. based on the principles of morality. Luxembourg has open views on the issue of youth sexuality, the Netherlands shows one of the lowest levels of teenage pregnancy in the world, and the Dutch approach is often seen as a model for other countries. Attitudes toward sex education in Germany are characterized as liberal, accepted and recognized by federal law. This is due to the declining birth rate, which currently requires a rethinking of the position of politicians and the church on sex education and sex education of young people, while continuing to recognize the right of every citizen of the state to start a family. Sex education in France has a holistic approach and plays an important role in the sexual and emotional development of young people, helping them to resist the influence of the media and social media. Improving the national systems of school sex education in the studied countries requires the formation of an effective gender policy in each country."

Birckhead \nAlthough precise statistics do not exist, data suggests that the number of children believed to be at risk for commercial sexual exploitation in the United States is between 200,000 and 300,000 and that the average age of entry is between eleven and fourteen, with some as young as nine. The number of prostituted children who are criminally prosecuted for these acts is equally difficult to estimate. In 2008—the most recent year for which data is available—approximately 1500 youth under age eighteen were reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation as having been arrested within United States borders for prostitution and commercialized sex. Anecdotal evidence suggests, however, that these numbers reflect only a small fraction of the children who face criminal charges as a result of their prostituted status. Research also reveals that because most states have laws that hold children criminally liable for ―selling‖ sex, law enforcement and the courts readily pathologize these youth, a significant  Assistant Professor of Law, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Law (tbirckhe@email.unc.edu).

Statistics additionally suggest that the number of American girls who are sexually exploited is increasing, particularly for those between the ages of thirteen and seventeen. Likewise, it is estimated that eighty percent of prostituted women began this activity when they, themselves, were younger than eighteen. Yet, nearly all states can criminally prosecute children for prostitution even when they are too young to legally consent to sex with adults, and very few communities have developed effective programs designed to prevent or intervene in the sexual exploitation of youth. This Article critically examines the prevalence of laws allowing for the criminal prosecution of minors for prostitution. It argues that rather than maintain a legal scheme that characterizes and treats such juveniles as willing participants who, if harmed, are merely getting what they deserve, a more nuanced approach must be developed in which—at a minimum— criminal liability should be consistent with age of consent and statutory rape laws. It analyzes the range of ways in which states have addressed the problem of prostituted children, and it highlights those few that have successfully utilized strategies of intervention and rehabilitation rather than prosecution and incarceration. It contrasts the impact of state versus federal legislation as well as domestic versus international policy in this area and examines the ways in which these differences serve to perpetuate pernicious stereotypes vis-a-vis youth and crime. The Article addresses the historical treatment of prostituted children as criminals rather than victims by both American law and society, and critiques contemporary rationales for continuing a punitive approach toward these youth. The Article explores the conflicting statutory, common law, and colloquial meanings of the terms ―prostitution,‖ ―consent,‖ and ―bodily autonomy‖ as they relate to children and sexuality. It also considers the extent to which the criminal offenses of prostitution and statutory rape address different sets of harms and explores how gender and sexual orientation are implicated in the discussion. The Article concludes by highlighting model programs directed at prevention, intervention, and rehabilitation, as well as proposing strategies for reform, such as decriminalization and diversion.

As this gap widens so too does ambiguity between asserted rights, interests, and threats. As a result society perceives heightened tensions and risks when engaging the Web. How do we narrow this gap and thereby lower risks of actions online in manner that instills trust, safeguards autonomy, and promotes ingenuity? One part of this solution is to embrace the fundamental principles of ethics to guide our decisions in the midst of information uncertainty. One context where this solution is germinating is cyber security research. These research activities are prerequisite for evidence-based policymaking that impacts us individually and collectively, such as infrastructure security, cyber crime, network neutrality, free market competition, spectrum application and broadband deployment, censorship, technology transfer, and intellectual property rights. Therefore, in the wake of struggles to resolve the aforementioned mounting tensions, ethics has re-emerged as a crucial ordering force. For this reason, ethics underpins the debate among cyber security researchers, oversight entities, industrial organizations, the government and end users about the acceptability of Internet research activities."

This paper argues, by means of five theoretical perspectives, that because of the variety HBIBs generate, they contribute to the economy over and above their direct and indirect contributions in terms of revenue and employment. A multiple case study approach is employed studying the best practices of eight HBIBs. It is found that HBIBs generate variety because of the unique way in which they operate, and because of the reasons why they are started. How HBIBs operate can be captured in the acronym SMILES: Speed, Multiple income, Inexpensive, LEan, and Smart. They are founded (amongst other motives) for reasons of autonomy, freedom and independence. Both aspects - the how and why - of HBIBs are conducive to the creation of variety as they facilitate trial-and-error commercialization of authentic ideas. Five theoretical perspectives posit that variety is important for the industry and the economy: evolutionary theory, strategic management, organic urban planning, opportunity recognition, and the knowledge economy. The findings are discussed in the context of each perspective."

The Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC defines a “data controller” broadly to refer to the ‘natural or legal person, public authority, agency or any other body which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of processing are determined by national or Community laws or regulations, the controller or the specific criteria for his nomination may be designated by national or Community law.’ If the definition of the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC (DPD) is applied literally to social networking sites such as Facebook and MySpace, arguably, not only organisations such as FB and MySpace are regarded as “data controllers” (through Art. 4 of the DPD), but individuals who posted information about others (friends or work colleagues etc.) would also be regarded as “data controllers” and thus have to adhere to the legal rules laid down under the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC (ie. Art. 7 of the DPD fair and lawful processing; not excessive etc) unless it could be shown that the exemptions under Art. 9 that processing was intended for journalistic, artistic and literary purposes or that Art. 13 exceptions apply. As identified in an earlier paper, Art. 3.2 DPD (Wong and Savirimuthu, Art. 3(2) All or Nothing: This is the Question? The Application of Art. 3(2) Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC to the Internet) is unlikely to apply whereby processing was carried out for private and domestic purposes.

The theory suggests that information technology is a decentralizing force, whereas communication technology is a centralizing force. Using a new data set of American and European manufacturing firms, we find indeed that better information technologies (enterprise resource planning (ERP) for plant managers and computer-assisted design/computer-assisted manufacturing for production workers) are associated with more autonomy and a wider span of control, whereas technologies that improve communication (like data intranets) decrease autonomy for workers and plant managers. Using instrumental variables (distance from ERP’s place of origin and heterogeneous telecommunication costs arising from regulation) strengthens our results.

IP traditionally is characterized as providing economic incentives to invest in creative production or as a reward for intellectual labor, and accordingly IP laws typically are associated with the needs of corporate creators and celebrity artists. In an era of smartphones and social media, however, IP has become a tool for a diverse range of vulnerable individuals to assert autonomy within unequal and risky digital environments.\nThis paper examines cases in which IP is not being used to fortify economic incentives or reward labor but instead as a way to manage boundaries around sensitive and intimate social activities. These include lawsuits to combat the nonconsensual dissemination of sexual imagery and lawsuits by families of deceased artists and public figures to shape the cultural memory of the deceased. IP theory has often resisted addressing questions of sexual autonomy, privacy, or family mourning, yet IP is playing an increasingly important role in mediating each. Many scholars have stressed that we no longer need IP laws to spur widespread creative activity in the social media era; nevertheless, the social, emotional, and economic stakes surrounding control over image, sounds, and text arguably have never been greater.\nThis paper makes two main contributions. First, it shows that IP often provides an effective tool for managing personal and social boundaries and as a result reinforces autonomy, community, and kinship among the diverse group of individuals who become rights holders. Individuals are using the old tools of IP to tackle a new and different set of socioeconomic challenges. Second, as a normative matter, it argues that IP provides some important practical and conceptual advantages over other legal responses to sexual privacy and family mourning. IP delegates context-sensitive boundary-management decisions to individuals, families, and communities—as opposed to more top-down criminal or regulatory solutions—and can be transferred within communities and across generations—as opposed to more individualized tort and contract solutions. Although undeniably a break from traditional theory, IP can be a useful means of legally responding to emergent cultural vulnerabilities."

The results showed that the combined use of proactive and defensive self-presentation strategies on Chinese social media instead of American social media were more effective to fulfill the sojourners’ need for autonomy. Moreover, presentation strategies that helped to meet the sojourners’ need for relatedness were significantly different between Chinese and American social media.

    "text": "Doc 1334 :  The Internet – a teaching resource \nhttps://doi.org/10.30979/rev.abeno.v7i1.1414\n Elaine Manso Oliveira Franco de Carvalho \n José Luiz Lage-Marques \nThe world is constantly undergoing changes, and the Internet is being used as an important teaching resource. From the chalk piece to the computer, technology has been present in school as a link between action and learning for professors and students. Technological tools are more and more frequent in the class room: the computer along with its chief resource – the Internet – have raised a debate about their effectiveness in school education. The use of the Internet in educational programs has revealed that this resource gives rise to educational environments which are different from that of the traditional attendance classes regarding the roles of teachers and students, the flow of information, the degree of autonomy and participation of students, and the development of complex competencies such as those involving the resolution of problems. Nevertheless, experience shows that these results are useful and effective only when teachers are technically prepared for them. To educate using new technology is a challenge which has not yet been thoroughly tackled. Technology may help, but to educate is fundamentally to learn how to manage a set of information and turn it into something significant to the individual, namely knowledge. The introduction of the Internet into school programs acts as a catalyst for change. Therefore it is appropriate to consider this new tool as a precious aid to learning."

Design/methodology/approach A thematic analysis of qualitative data from an international survey on COVID-19 and social media. The analysis was inspired by Berger and Luckmann’s theory of reality as a social construction. Findings Articulations expressed an instant internalisation and externalisation of the officially defined “new normal”. However, negotiations of this “new normal” were articulated, whereby everyday life activities could proceed. Resistance to the “new normal” appeared, as routines and common sense understandings of everyday life were threatened. Health-care professionals were put in a paradoxical situation, living in accordance with the “new normal” outside work and legitimately deviating from it at work. The “new normal” calls for individuals’ “oughtonomy” rather than autonomy. Social media were used to push individual’s re-socialisation into the “new normal”. The latter both promoted and challenged human rights as the individual’s right to self-determination extends beyond the self as it risks threatening other people’s right to life. Originality/value With the means of a theoretically based thematic analysis inspired by Berger and Luckmann, the current study shows how articulations on COVID-19 and social media can both support and challenge human rights and reality as a facticity as dictated by dominant organisations and discourses in society."

In the case of disabilities that impact mobility, power wheelchairs can help such people retain or regain autonomy. Nonetheless, driving a power wheelchair is a complex task that requires a combination of cognitive, visual and visuo-spatial abilities. In practice, people need to pass prior ability tests and driving training before being prescribed a power wheelchair by their therapist. Still, conventional training in occupational therapy can be insufficient for some people with severe cognitive and/or visio-spatial functions. As such, these people are often prevented from obtaining a power wheelchair prescription from their therapist due to safety concerns. In this context, driving simulators might be efficient and promising tools to provide alternative, adaptive, flexible, and safe training. In previous work, we proposed a Virtual Reality (VR) driving simula-integrating vestibular feedback to simulate wheelchair motion sensations. The performance and acceptability of a VR simulator rely on satisfying user Quality of Experience (QoE). Therefore, our simulator is designed to give the user a high Sense of Presence (SoP) and low Cyber-sickness. This paper presents a pilot study assessing the impact of the vestibular feedback provided on user QoE. Participants were asked to perform a driving task whilst in the simulator under two conditions: with and without vestibular feedback. User QoE is assessed through subjective questionnaires measuring user SoP and cyber-sickness. The results show that vestibular feedback activation increases SoP and decreases cyber-sickness. This study constitutes a mandatory step before clinical trials and, as such, only enrolled people without disabilities."

As such, AI-driven tools are more than simple tools. Within newsrooms, AI-driven tools exemplify potentially far-reaching structural changes in internal routines and divisions of responsibility between humans and machines. Within European media markets, the introduction of AI-driven tools brings with it substantial structural shifts and transformations of power. And from the perspective of users and society, AI-driven tools could result in new, smarter and more responsive ways of informing the public, but when applied wrongly, also have potentially a detrimental effect on the public sphere, on pluralism, privacy, autonomy and equal chances to communicate. The right to freedom of expression in Article 10 ECHR is an important basis to inform law and policy makers on possible approaches to regulating AI in the media (including the European Commissionâ€™s ambitious plans for regulating AI), but can also more broadly inform our thinking about the potential and threats from AI for the realisation of freedom of expression, and the role of the media in that context. After an introduction to some of the recent developments around AI and algorithms in the news media, we will highlight some of the most pressing freedom of expression implications stemming from AI-driven tools in the news media. We will also show that the protection afforded under Article 10 ECHR comes with specific duties and responsibilities for the news media and reflect on the question of how to deal with AI-driven tools in a way that is compatible with fundamental rights and freedoms. Finally, we will explain that, while the introduction of AI-driven tools can create new opportunities for users to exercise their freedom of expression rights, the application of automated filtering and sorting can also result in new digital inequalities and unequal opportunities of access to information."

In a former study, a simpler system was developed to explore the effect of modality on learners’ foreign language anxiety (FLA) where results suggested that anxiety was statistically significantly lower in the VR environment compared to a voice and video chat system. However, of three key affordances—presence, interactivity, and autonomy—the previous system only focused on presence. The current system features an interactive component also. In this paper, we present results of a study which compared the two systems (presence-only versus interactive system) with the aim of answering the question: Does more-fully utilizing the affordances of VR lower or increase learners’ FLA? In a counterbalanced design, 30 participants (15 pairs) completed a spot-the-difference task in two different VR environments: static-VR (former system) and interactive-VR (current system). Results of a post-experimental questionnaire suggested that there was no difference in participants’ FLA for the two domains. However, a significant difference was found in terms of ease of communication and enjoyment which favored the interactive-VR mode. Additionally, compared to predictions that the interactive-VR task would be more cognitively demanding, it was considered simpler than the static-VR task. This suggests that using more of the affordances of VR by increasing interactivity further may make the embodied experience more life-like and therefore increase opportunities for learning. This paper introduces the system, implications for researchers and teachers, and future research directions."

The readiness of a bachelor in cybersecurity for professional activity is outlined, which in essence is a selective and predictable activity of a bachelor in cybersecurity at the stage of its preparation for professional activity and arises from the moment of determining the purpose of activity on the basis of perceived needs and motives, personality plan, guidelines and models for future action. It is proved that the readiness of a bachelor in cybersecurity for professional activity can be formed by means of collaborative learning in an educational and digital environment. That is, the readiness of the bachelor of cybersecurity for professional activities, we can understand essentially selective and predictable activity of the bachelor of cybersecurity in the preparation for the profession and arises from the moment of determining the purpose of activities based on perceived needs and motives, personality plan, guidelines and models for future action. The structure of virtual modeling in the online laboratory for bachelors in cybersecurity in the educational-digital environment is determined, which consists of three interfaces: the interface of the higher education applicant, the interface of the teacher and the interface of the administrator. It is noted that it is important in the collaborative training of bachelors in cybersecurity that the environment in which they interact should be based on democracy, equality and autonomy, with this rule training will be at a high level and as a result will be successful. The organization of collaborative training of bachelors in cybersecurity in an educational and digital environment should be based on the principles of social contact. It was found out that the main principles of collaborative learning in mobile applications for bachelors in cybersecurity in the educational-digital environment included the systematic establishment of social contacts during the training of bachelors in cybersecurity, development of communication, building relationships between bachelors in cybersecurity in educational digital environment on democracy and autonomy, changing the role of participants in the educational process in time depending on the nature and nature of the problem and psychological comfort."

They have been linked to anxiety, depression, diminished attention span, sleep disturbance, and decreased relationship satisfaction. Perhaps what is most worrying from a moral perspective, however, is the effect these devices can have on our autonomy. In this article, we argue that there is an obligation to foster and safeguard autonomy in ourselves, and we suggest that wireless mobile devices pose a serious threat to our capacity to fulfill this obligation. We defend the existence of an imperfect duty to be a ‘digital minimalist’. That is, we have a moral obligation to be intentional about how and to what extent we use these devices. The empirical findings already justify prudential reasons in favor of digital minimalism, but the moral duty is distinct from and independent of prudential considerations."

However, smartphones and other connected devices come with specific features and characteristics and, in consequence, raise particular ethical issues. This article addresses this important intersection of citizen science and the Internet of Things by focusing on how such ethical issues are communicated in scholarly literature. To answer this research question, this article presents a scoping review of published scientific studies or case studies of scientific studies that utilize both citizen scientists and Internet of Things devices. Specifically, this scoping review protocol retrieved studies where the authors had included at least a short discussion of the ethical issues encountered during the research process. A full text analysis of relevant articles conducted inductively and deductively identified three main categories of ethical issues being communicated: autonomy and data privacy, data quality, and intellectual property. Based on these categories, this review offers an overview of the legal and social innovation implications raised. This review also provides recommendations for researchers who wish to innovatively integrate citizen scientists and Internet of Things devices into their research based on the strategies researchers took to resolve these ethical issues."

In the context of searching the ways of optimizing this process, the aim of our study is to determine the features and opportunities for the development of individualization of learning by means of information and communication technologies in multinational corporations in Canada in order to use their experience in Ukrainian higher education. The set of interrelated general scientific research methods was used to achieve this goal: analysis, synthesis, comparison, generalization, systematization, which were used to study the scientific literature, programs and corporate training courses in multinational corporations in Canada. Analysis of training in Canadian multinational corporations shows that the use of the advanced information and communication technologies in independent non-formal learning, including mobile learning, social networks, Massive Open Online Courses, electronic coaching, corporate blogs, gamification, wikis, etc., contributes to the deepening of individualization of training, and the practice of employee’s independent planning and implementation of his/her learning process is becoming more common. The study concludes that individualization is an important aspect of training in Canadian multinational corporations. The basis of individualization of learning is self-direction, autonomy of students, their willingness to take responsibility for planning and implementation of all stages of their learning."

Materials and methods: This study was conducted during June-October of 2020. Through a broad literature review, analysis of EU, USA regulation acts, scientific researches and opinions of progressive-minded people in this sphere this paper provide a guide to understanding the essence of AI in healthcare and specifics of its regulation. It is based on dialectical, comparative, analytic, synthetic and comprehensive methods. Results: One of the first broad definitions of AI sounded like “Artificial Intelligence is the study of ideas which enable computers to do the things that make people seem intelligent … The central goals of Artificial Intelligence are to make computers more useful and to understand the principles which make intelligence possible.” There are two approaches to name this technology - “Artificial intelligence” and “Augmented Intelligence.” We prefer to use a more common category of “Artificial intelligence” rather than “Augmented Intelligence” because the last one, from our point of view, leaves much space for “human supervision” meaning, and that will limit the sense of AI while it will undoubtedly develop in future. AI in current practice is interpreted in three forms, they are: AI as a simple electronic tool without any level of autonomy (like electronic assistant, “calculator”), AI as an entity ith some level of autonomy, but under human control, and AI as an entity with broad autonomy, substituting human’s activity wholly or partly, and we have to admit that the first one cannot be considered as AI at all in current conditions of science development. Description of AI often tends to operate with big technological products like DeepMind (by Google), Watson Health (by IBM), Healthcare’s Edison (by General Electric), but in fact, a lot of smaller technologies also use AI in the healthcare field – smartphone applications, wearable health devices and other examples of the Internet of Things. At the current stage of development AI in medical practice is existing in three technical forms: software, hardware, and mixed forms using three main scientific-statistical approaches – flowchart method, database method, and decision-making method. All of them are useable, but they are differently suiting for AI implementation. The main issues of AI implementation in healthcare are connected with the nature of technology in itself, complexities of legal support in terms of safety and efficiency, privacy, ethical and liability concerns. Conclusion: The conducted analysis makes it possible to admit a number of pros and cons in the field of AI using in healthcare. Undoubtedly this is a promising area with a lot of gaps and grey zones to fill in. Furthermore, the main challenge is not on technology itself, which is rapidly growing, evolving, and uncovering new areas of its use, but rather on the legal framework that is clearly lacking appropriate regulations and some political, ethical, and financial transformations. Thus, the core questions regarding is this technology by its nature is suitable for healthcare at all? Is the current legislative framework looking appropriate to regulate AI in terms of safety, efficiency, premarket, and postmarked monitoring? How the model of liability with connection to AI technology using in healthcare should be constructed? How to ensure privacy without the restriction of AI technology use? Should intellectual privacy rights prevail over public health concerns? Many questions to address in order to move in line with technology development and to get the benefits of its practical implementation."

Drawing on transformative service research (TSR) and technology adoption literature, it examines the main challenges for the elderly when adopting Internet services and how they and their family members can co-create value to improve the elderly service inclusion and well-being. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative methodology is used to identify challenges, value co-creation behaviors and well-being outcomes of elderly individuals and their family members when using Internet services. The data collection method involved 24 in-depth interviews with consumers over 75 years of age and their family members. Findings This research first recognizes specific challenges for the elderly in adopting Internet services related to resistance to technology adoption and health impairments. Second, the findings identify value co-creation behaviors held by elderly consumers of Internet services: learning and formal training, complying with indications and seeking help when they encounter problems with technology. Family members also contribute to elderly well-being through two value co-creation behaviors: helping and supporting elderly relatives with technology and being patient and tolerant when they need support. Finally, these behaviors are found to influence five dimensions of elderly consumers’ well-being: enjoyment, personal growth, mastery, autonomy and social connectedness. Originality/value This study addresses a gap in the literature by exploring the value co-creation behaviors of elderly consumers of Internet services and their family members for improving well-being outcomes. Understanding value co-creation and well-being for elderly consumers of Internet services is an emerging and under-researched area in TSR and service inclusion literature."

Drawing on a critical realist account of semiosis, the framing of internet addiction in China is analysed using the documentary film Web Junkie as an empirical pivot and point of departure. A contextual overview of relations, interests, and tensions surrounding youth and the internet in China is provided, and the film Web Junkie is briefly presented. The main body of the article consists of a critical analysis of conceptualisations of “reality” and “escape.” The core tension focused on in the analysis is the struggle over time, necessitating engagement with critical thought on hope and utopia. The analysis concludes that struggles over temporal autonomy underlie conflicting claims about “reality” and “escape” that are central to “internet addiction” and its treatment in China today."

This article takes the course “Cooking Technology” as an example to build an online and offline blended teaching mode, and investigates the application of blended teaching in the teaching of applied undergraduate courses. Using empirical analysis and interview methods, the article found that the curriculum teaching of “Cooking Technology” has insufficient combination of theory and practice, single teaching mode, poor teaching effect, and heavy teaching tasks. Base on the principle of student-centered, pedagogical coherence, integration of theory and practice, this article designs the blended teaching activities for the “Cooking Technology” course from the three major links, which is the pre-course phase, in-class stage and after-school phase. This article puts forward the issues that should be focus on interaction in blended learning and teaching, establishing a reasonable and sound appraisal method, pay attention to the percentage of online instruction used, so as to provide reference and reference for the construction of “golden courses” of culinary majors and other majors. Finally, the study found that the blended teaching can better cultivate students’ autonomy in learning and solve the basic problems that most students are not interested in learning."

To fill this gap, mobile-assisted language learning emerges as a portable option for computer-mediated learning and testing. Hence, this action research aims to study the implementation of mobile phones-assisted practice, combined with note-taking, as test-wise and test-management strategies, to tackle the needs of 218 participants who were taking an English as a foreign language program at a Colombian university. In the diagnostic stage, learners expressed that the most difficult computer-assessed skill was speaking, due to lack of confidence and suitable strategies. Findings revealed an improvement in students’ oral performance, collaboration levels, and high acceptance of mobile phones-assisted practice as a test preparation tool that facilitates autonomy, metacognition, and peer-feedback."

Therefore, AI regulation, legislation, frameworks, and guidelines are presently fragmented, isolated, or co-exist in an opaque space between national governments, international bodies, corporations, practitioners, think-tanks, and civil society organisations. This article proposes a research design set up to address this problem by directly collaborating with targeted actors to identify principles for AI that are trustworthy, accountable, safe, fair, non-discriminatory, and which puts human rights and the social good at the centre of its approach. It proposes 21 interlinked substudies, focusing on the ethical judgements, empirical statements, and practical guidelines, which manufacture ethicopolitical visions and AI policies across four domains: seven tech corporations, seven governments, seven civil society actors, together with the analysis of online public debates. The proposed research design uses multiple research techniques: extensive mapping and studies of AI ethics policy documents and 120 interviews of key individuals, as well as assorted analyses of public feedback discussion loops on AI, employing digital methods on online communities specialising in AI debates. It considers novel conceptual interactions communicated across the globe, expands the regulatory, ethics, and technological foresight, both at the individual level (autonomy, identity, dignity, privacy, and data protection) and the societal level (fairness/equality, responsibility, accountability and transparency, surveillance/datafication, democracy and trust, collective humanity and the common good). By producing an innovative, intercontinental, multidisciplinary research design for an Ethical AI Standard, this article offers a concrete plan to search for the Holy Grail of Artificial Intelligence: Its Ethics."

Griffiths \n Intan Hashimah Mohd Hashima \nProblematic internet use (PIU) has become public health concern, particularly among adolescents and emerging adults. There is growing interest concerning the potential impacts of early maladaptive schemas (EMSs) on PIU and its most severe manifestation internet addiction (IA). However, a deeper understanding of these relationships is needed regarding of effects of schemas on IA. The purpose of the present study was to explore the role of EMSs among adults.The sample comprised 714 Iranian participants who completed a self-report survey comprising sociodemographic variables, the Internet Addiction Test (IAT), and the Young Schema Questionnaire-Short Form (YSQ-SF). The data were analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM).Findings indicated that there was a positive and significant relationship between EMS domains and IA. The results confirmed that disconnection/rejection schema domains and impaired autonomy/performance schema domains were significantly related with IA. The results of the analysis of convergent validity and discriminant validity were acceptable among the nine reflective constructs.Findings of the present study indicated that existence of underlying EMSs may be a vulnerability factor for developing IA and adds to the growing body of cyberpsychology literature that has examined the relationships between the EMSs and IA."

Participants described the experience of recovery as an ongoing, nonlinear and dialectical process that was not synonymous with cure and often took place in the context of supportive relationships.While the broad themes of recovery align with those derived from adult literature, the accounts diverge with respect to the content within the domains themselves. The findings suggest that services oriented to trauma-exposed young people need to bolster these internal processes of change, while also attending to their specific developmental needs and capacities.

Parental support may protect against mental health problems after being victimized, but nonsupportive parental influences may also exacerbate harm. This study investigated whether parenting dimensions (autonomy support, psychological control) moderated the associations between bullying victimization and mental health problems among heterosexual and LGBQ adolescents. An anonymous survey was completed by 1037 adolescents (M age = 15.2 ± 1.9, 50% female). Regression analyses examined associations between victimization, sexual orientation, and mental health problems, and investigated the moderating role of parenting. Both forms of victimization were associated with higher mental health problems. LGBQ youth experienced more depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation than heterosexual youth. Lower levels of parental psychological control and higher levels of autonomy support were related to having fewer mental health problems. However, perceived autonomy support appeared less protective when adolescents experienced more frequent victimization. Moreover, parental psychological control was related to heightened risk for suicidal plans specifically among LGBQ youth and also exacerbated the association between cyberbullying victimization and stress among LGBQ youth. These findings underscore the need to address parenting in whole-school antibullying and mental health promotion programs."

Cheng \n Ching-I Teng \nPurpose Online games are prevalent internet applications and are known for satisfying the various needs of users. Nonetheless, little is known about whether online games could be a resort for users encountering workplace frustration. Explaining how workplace frustration and users’ need satisfaction affect loyalty of online gamers, this study aims to formulate hypotheses and develop a framework based on the self-determination theory (SDT). Design/methodology/approach The authors use an online survey to collect 848 responses and use structural equation modelling to test the hypotheses. Findings The authors find that workplace frustration, autonomy need satisfaction and competence need satisfaction are positively related to online gamer loyalty. Moreover, workplace frustration enhances the link between competence need satisfaction and online gamer loyalty. Originality/value The authors are the first to use SDT to identify the three antecedents and the moderator of online gamer loyalty. Our findings offer a key message that game providers could design effective means to retain their gamers by understanding their gamers’ workplace frustration and informing them that playing games could alleviate the associated negative feelings."

The research results lead to reflecting on the potential role of media literacy in the development of learners’ autonomy."

Based on this problem analysis, and the recent experience of regulating cyber conflict and LAWS through Groups of Governmental Experts, the article proposes a schema for multilateral governance of digital technologies in armed conflict. The schema includes a heuristic for understanding human–machine interaction in order to operationalize accountability with international humanitarian law principles and international law applicable to armed conflict in the digital age. The article concludes with specific suggestions for advancing work in multilateral forums dealing with cyber weapons and lethal autonomy."

The ultimate aim of the paper is to shed light on the attitudes that inform the way this technology is perceived and the cultural and ideological nuances that this brings to the fore, as well as how this culturally nuanced view may help us better discern the potential advantages and ethical challenges associated with this new technology."

This creates challenges for education systems, as school must provide all students with the educational experiences that will enable them to develop the skills reflected in the profile of the 21st-century student on com pletion of compulsory schooling. It is up to teachers to find new ways of teaching, making the most of the resources and digital tools made available by mobile technologies. Technology can make a significant contribution to increasing students’ motivation because it is closer to what they like and use in their daily lives. And this introduction of technology into the classroom can promote student-oriented teaching, which contributes to the development of skills such as autonomy, critical thinking and self-esteem.\n One of the areas that can contribute to this paradigm shift is the creation of experiences in immersive learning environments such as Transmedia Storytelling. Immersive learning environments can favour the creation and implementation of projects that promote reading skills in schools. This is the focus of this article.\n The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of transmedia storytelling on the level of motivation of students and on the improvement of pedagogical practices implemented by the teachers involved. This case study was carried out in the subject of Portuguese in three 7th-grade classes of a school from the Médio Tejo region.\n The results obtained suggest a high level of motivation of students and teachers. The latter recognise that pedagogical routes using Transmedia Storytelling contribute to the motivation, autonomy and improvement of students’ learning."

Motivation for learning is interpreted as a system of external and internal motives for learning, the hierarchy and interaction of which is formed under the influence of pedagogical conditions, has a multilevel structure, the formation levels of which can be assessed by a certain criteria and indicators. The specific factors of motivation for learning are characterized, the reasons for the motivation decrease of students of non-language specialities when studying a foreign language are regarded. The necessity of realizing the principles of subjectivity, professionally-oriented technological effectiveness, interactivity, independence (autonomy), communicativeness, consciousness, accessibility, and stages in the linguistic and professional development of students in the conditions of distance learning is proved. The active introduction of distance learning technologies to the education system of Ukraine is emphasized. The distance learning is interpreted as a system of professionally oriented training of students constructed in a certain way in the Internet environment. The effectiveness of distance learning and the specifics of designing individual educational routes of higher education students are substantiated. The main tasks and imperatives of linguistic and professional training of future specialists are determined. The special importance of improving the goals, content, forms and methods of teaching in order to increase motivation for learning of students is emphasized."

To achieve autonomy in the digital sphere, European alternatives to digital services and products need to be established. However, such efforts must also extend to the level of information technology infrastructure. To that end, decentralized indexing of the internet could significantly help to strengthen Europe’s digital sovereignty. Nevertheless, legal challenges need to be overcome to make that vision a reality."

In this scenario Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are particularly elected for modeling such types of intelligent, decentralised processes, thanks to their autonomy in pursuing collective and cooperative goals. From a human perspective, however, increasing the confidence in trustworthiness of MAS based Cyber-physical Production Systems (CPPS) remains a significant challenge. Manufacturing services must comply with strong requirements in terms of reliability, robustness and latency, and solution providers are expected to ensure that agents will operate within certain boundaries of the production, and mitigate unattended behaviours during the execution of manufacturing activities. To address this concern, a Manufacturing Agent Accountability Framework is proposed, a dynamic authorization framework that defines and enforces boundaries in which agents are freely permitted to exploit their intelligence to reach individual and collective objectives. The expected behaviour of agents is to adhere to CPPS workflows which implicitly define acceptable regions of behaviours and production feasibility. Core contributions of the proposed framework are: a manufacturing accountability model, the representation of the Leaf Diagrams for the governance of agent behavioural autonomy, and an ontology of declarative policies for the identification and avoidance of ill-intentioned behaviours in the execution of CPPS services. We outline the application of this enhanced trustworthiness framework to an agent-based manufacturing use-case for the production of a variety of hand tools."

The aim of the current qualitative study was to examine young people’s perceptions of their own sexual agency in relation to their social media attitudes and behaviors. Participants (n = 31) were recruited from a nonprofit organization and asked to complete a one-hour in-depth interview and a demographic survey. Using an inductive method, involving constant comparison, we identified four overarching themes: (a) Participants utilize different social media platforms for distinct purposes and are cognizant of each audience; (b) Based on past experiences, participants have negotiated and created their own rules of engagement for online behavior; (c) Participants have different expectations about how others should act online versus how they act in relation to flirty or sexual messages; (d) Participants were concerned about the authenticity of online identities and are aware of vulnerability in online interactions. Our results highlight the need for sexual health researchers to observe social network etiquette closely through the lens of autonomy and agency."

Zuboff conceptualizes surveillance capitalism as a new economic logic made possible by ICT and its architecture for extracting and trading data products of user behavior and preferences. Surveillance is, through these new technologies, built into the fabric of our economic system and, according to Zuboff, appears as deeply anti-democratic and a threat to human sovereignty, dignity, and autonomy. In Europe, the framework of responsible research and innovation is promoted as an approach and a meta-concept that should inform practice and policy for research and innovation to align with societal values and democratic principles. Within this approach, ICT is framed as a risk technology. As innovation in mobile journalism is inextricably tied to the technologies and infrastructure of smartphones and social media platforms, the apparent question would be how we can envision responsible innovation in this area. Zuboff provides a critical perspective to study how this architecture of surveillance impedes the practice of mobile journalism. While the wide adoption of smartphones as a key tool for both producing and consuming news has great potential for innovation, it can also feed behavioral data into the supply chain of surveillance capitalism. We discuss how potentially harmful implications can be met on an individual and organizational level to contribute to a more responsible adoption of mobile technologies in journalism."

This essay discusses promising areas of legal research related to robotics and its corresponding legal regulations. The definition of robotics is based and proposed as all categories of robots in their broadest sense, regardless of their purpose, degree of danger, mobility, or autonomy, as well as cyber-physical systems with artificial intelligence in any form. It is proposed to recognize socially dangerous acts committed with the use of robotics as crimes committed in a generally dangerous way if there are grounds for doing so. It is concluded that the commission of acts through robotics is capable, in certain cases, of creating a plurality of crimes in the form of a real aggregate. The expanding powers of State security bodies, which can carry out the functions of state policy development, legal regulation, control, and supervision in the field of robotics application, have been verified."

    "text": "Doc 1363 :  Sharing the Passion for Learning Around the World \nhttps://doi.org/10.29173/iasl7682\n Patricia Carmichael \n Donna Meyer \nThis paper reports the positive impact of international collaboration, utilization of technology and the Independent Learning Centre Program (ILCP) on student confidence and personal achievement. During 2008-2009, Concordia Lutheran College (CLC), an Australian K-12 school and Patrick County High School (PCHS), an American secondary school worked together to deliver the Independent Learning Centre Program (ILCP) as developed by Carmichael (2008). This project utilized the Learning Activity Management System (LAMS) as a support system for delivery. The purpose of the online delivery was to make available to Patrick County High School, the teaching and learning strategies enhancing independent learning skills for information literacy and differentiated instruction (Tomlinson, 2003) via the Internet. The program gave students in both schools the opportunity to collaborate internationally and engage in a research topic of personal interest. It was anticipated this program would foster a sense of learner autonomy (Confessore & Confessore, 1994) enhancing students’ faith in their ability to accomplish an individual project contributing to cognitive development and furthering their journey in learning for the duration of their formal schooling."

Younger people are often found to be more innovative toward technology, especially related to smartphones (Rai et al. , 2013). Most mHealth application downloaders are continually shifting between applications because of the hyper-competition making achieving loyal consumers challenging (Racherla et al. , 2012). The purpose of this paper is to study the determinants that help increase young consumers mHealth application loyalty. This study integrates self-determination theory (SDT), gamification elements and engagement to examine loyalty. Design/methodology/approach A valid sample of 263 college student’s data was obtained for data analysis from a survey conducted in multiple campuses of the Delhi University in India. Findings The three psychological needs: need for autonomy, need for competence and need for relatedness, showed a positive impact on intrinsic motivation. From the gamification factors; perceived playfulness, the level of challenge and social interaction, only the first two showed a positive impact on extrinsic motivation. Both motivation factors influence engagement, showing a frequent interaction with the application, leading to loyalty. Originality/value Previous studies examined the adoption of mHealth services, this study is one of the first to examine young consumers’ loyalty in using mhealth apps. It sheds light on the existing literature and contributes to research on mHealth applications by determining the factors that lead to loyalty by the young consumers."

The author analyzed the use of information and communication technologies during training sessions - lectures and seminars on philosophy, preparation of abstracts and scientific works on the specified discipline. It is revealed that the systematic use of information and communication technologies of teaching allows creating a fundamentally new information educational sphere, thus providing wide opportunities for educational activities, greatly affects the redistribution of roles among its participants, increases motivation, develops autonomy, provides individualization and differentiation of the educational process , contributes to the modernization of the traditional education system. All this makes it possible to improve the quality of learning. The article states that the inclusion of information and communication technologies in the educational process creates a network environment in which education becomes a sequence of social contacts, each of which is communication. Thanks to the use of modern information and communication technologies, in particular in philosophy classes, the teacher has the opportunity to use all the necessary tools for effective assimilation and perception of the researched issues. Lectures become more saturated with factual material, and students listen more, rather than writing under dictation, which is positively perceived by listeners. Modern multimedia technologies, opening students access to non-traditional sources of information, increase the efficiency of independent work in philosophy, provide completely new opportunities for creativity, finding and consolidating new professional skills, allow to implement fundamentally new forms and methods of learning, which certainly has a positive effect on the common activities of teacher and student in the process of studying philosophy."

These changes make the scientific task of their timely conceptualization urgent. The purpose of this study is to generalize and analyze the research results on the onyms functioning in the electronic environment and Internet communication. The analysis highlights two the main areas of the research that have developed in science to date. The functioning of the proper name in the Internet discourse is the study object of the first group. The Internet environment is mainly a source of language material according to this group research, which is analyzed considering the electronic communications features (its polycode, informality, interactivity). The feature of this group research is that its’ the main object is represented either by specific linguistic phenomena or special types of discourse, while electronic communication is a secondary feature for its highlight. The second research direction involves the study of new onomastic phenomena that owe their existence to the context of the electronic environment and its communicative, pragmatic, and technical features. This research direction implies both the detection of new types of onyms that were generated by Internet communications, and the description of their characteristic semantic, pragmatic, stylistic, and formal grammatical features. A special status among the objects studied in the second direction is given to such a phenomenon as a nickname, which implements a whole set of features that allow us to talk about its principal novelty and uniqueness. A nickname is the result of autonomy in terms of pragmatic and communication. This contributes to its use as a means of self-presentation and expression; also, a nickname has noticeable formal features that represent the ways of its construction (free choice of motivational bases, language play, active use of non-alphabetic characters). There is also noted an impact of new phenomena in Internet onomastics on the onomastic system and emphasized the need for closer attention to this influence."

    "text": "Doc 1367 :  Learner Autonomy: Learners’ Perceptions on Strategies to Achieve Autonomy in an EFL Classroom \nhttps://doi.org/10.32996/ijllt.2021.4.3.17\n Muhammad Amir Saeed \nLearner autonomy is considered as one of the most important factors contributing to lifelong learning for language learners studying at university. This is primarily because learners were likely to feel motivated and engaged when they were given the freedom to take charge of their learning. Higher Education in Oman has been relatively a recent phenomenon that was introduced three decades before. Ministry of Higher Education in Oman emphasis developing lifelong learning and self-study skills in learners studying at a higher educational institution in Oman. Most of the learners studying at higher educational institutions were taught by the native Arab speakers in schools, and they were mostly dependent on their teachers for the completion of different academic tasks in schools. Learner autonomy is now not desired but the obligatory aspect of learning under the current unprecedented circumstances where learners were required to take control of their learning, complete their tasks, assignments and projects on their own and where teacher intervention is minimal due to ‘remote teaching’ situation. The prevalent situation where technology has now taken the pivotal role in shaping the 21st century teaching and learning process, it is high need for the EFL learners studying at tertiary level at the university should be autonomous and critical thinkers who can control of their learning process and aware of the necessities of learning. Therefore, considering the learners’ spoon-feeding learning attitude at school and fast-changing learning requirement, the researcher aimed at identifying learners’ understanding and perceptions to achieve autonomy in learning in an EFL Context. This study also aims at finding out learners’ belief on the role of peers, teachers and social media in achieving autonomy in learning. By using mixed method approach, the researcher designed a 35-items Likert scale questionnaire and semi-structured interview questions to record the perceptions of 135 EFL learners studying at tertiary level in a private university in Oman. The results of the current study revealed that students were aware of the concept of learner autonomy and they believe that teacher’s scaffolding, peer intervention and use of social media platforms can not only help them to foster autonomy in them but also to gain confidence, motivation, self-esteem, sense of responsibility and self-determination in an EFL language learning environment. The implications of this research will assist the EFL teachers and the administration to consider EFL learners learning needs and learners’ self-efficacy and attitude towards their own learning."

Previous studies Show the evidence that work engagement is a significant predictor of performance. In this study, the relationship between work engagement, which is assumed as substitute for performance, and job resources is examined. At least one university from each city of Turkey is selected and academicians of those universities are sent 20- items survey via internet. 422 academicians is reached by using convenience sampling method. Job resources are subject to second order confirmatory factor analysis. Further, both for job resources and work engagement discriminant validity, convergent validity and composite reliability test are implemented. The results are analyzed with structural equation modelling. The results indicate that, job resources (autonomy, social support, coaching, opportunity for personal development and task significant) need to be enhanced in order to develop work engagement of Turkish academicians."

Battraw \n Adam S. R. Parker \n Patrick M. Pilarski \n Jonathon W. Sensinger \n Paul D. Marasco \nDuring every waking moment, we must engage with our environments, the people around us, the tools we use, and even our own bodies to perform actions and achieve our intentions. There is a spectrum of control that we have over our surroundings that spans the extremes from full to negligible. When the outcomes of our actions do not align with our goals, we have a tremendous capacity to displace blame and frustration on external factors while forgiving ourselves. This is especially true when we cooperate with machines; they are rarely afforded the level of forgiveness we provide our bodies and often bear much of our blame. Yet, our brain readily engages with autonomous processes in controlling our bodies to coordinate complex patterns of muscle contractions, make postural adjustments, adapt to external perturbations, among many others. This acceptance of biological autonomy may provide avenues to promote more forgiving human-machine partnerships. In this perspectives paper, we argue that striving for machine embodiment is a pathway to achieving effective and forgiving human-machine relationships. We discuss the mechanisms that help us identify ourselves and our bodies as separate from our environments and we describe their roles in achieving embodied cooperation. Using a representative selection of examples in neurally interfaced prosthetic limbs and intelligent mechatronics, we describe techniques to engage these same mechanisms when designing autonomous systems and their potential bidirectional interfaces."

Based on a multiyear empirical study, this article proposes a preliminary theoretical framework that maps 5 key dimensions of an emergent intersectional technopolitics : (1) intersectional anticapitalist politics enacted in meta-issue movements; (2) distributed online–offline media architectures and motility; (3) multiplicities of genres, forms, technologies, and spaces; (4) translocal solidarity economies and technologies; and (5) liberatory intersectional mechanisms of collective autonomy. The author argues that intersectional technopolitics is an innovative and complex set of coherent global social movement and media activist practices rooted in meta-issue movements integrated with transmedia digital technologies. The article concludes with a critical analysis of contradictions encountered by intersectional technopolitics activists as they interact with the structures of broader social movements, social media technologies, and societal hierarchies."

Technological developments will create (to create), access (to access), manage (to process), and utilize (to utilize) information precisely and accurately. Information is a very valuable commodity in the era of globalization to be mastered in order to increase the competitiveness of an organization in a sustainable manner. This phenomenon is important to study, because this system is expected to be a solution related to the implementation of effective, efficient, transparent and accountable local governments for efforts to prevent corruption by utilizing the application of this technology. This type of legal research used by researchers is empirical sociological legal research. Empirical sociological legal research that includes research on legal identification (unwritten) and research on legal effectiveness. Data collection was carried out by interview, observation and literature study. This study aims to analyze the effectiveness of the implementation of electronic-based regional autonomy on efforts to prevent corruption (a case study of the Bekasi City and Regency Government). The conclusion is that the effectiveness of the implementation of electronic-based autonomy is not optimal, there are still problems that there is no national integrated SPBE governance, SPBE has not been applied to the implementation of government administration and public services as a whole and optimally, the reach of ICT infrastructure to all regions and to all levels of society not optimal, the limited number of ASN employees who have ICT technical competence. based on the substance of the regulations, it is necessary to regulate the authority of the central government and local governments in managing e-government. Meanwhile, the culture of sharing data and information between government agencies is still low; Information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure has not reached all agencies, and information security management is weak in almost all government agencies. Based on the application of an electronic-based government system towards the prevention of corruption, one of which is to combat corruption is preventive efforts in addition to repressive measures"

Journalistic Culture on Social Networks in Israel \nhttps://doi.org/10.26351/siii/30-1/7\n Tal Laor \nIndependent journalism on social media networks appears to be changing the world of journalism. Building on Bourdieu’s field theory, the present study looked at journalists’ perceptions of values expressed in their online activities as compared to traditional news values. In-depth interviews were conducted with leading journalists active on traditional and online platforms in Israel in order to better understand journalists’ perceptions of the journalistic culture on the two kinds of platforms. The study found that by strongly emphasizing autonomy, online platforms empower journalists to embrace new values, including public service and immediacy. A public service ideology has expanded into online efforts to actively promote diverse issues that are not necessarily covered by traditional media. Immediacy is now dictated by the features of social media, which force journalists to respond in real time to all events relevant to their cause. Two values in the model of journalistic culture were found to be incompatible with the features of journalists’ online operations, and the ethics and objectivity of traditional journalism have been completely replaced by the online journalists’ orientation towards promoting their personal opinions, ideologies and agendas."

Employing a case study approach, interviews of 15 chemistry students were qualitatively analyzed. The results show negative effects of lacking internet connectivity and concurrence of learning and home spaces but positive effects of ceased commute between home and campus. Teachers’ implementation of digital learning opportunities was perceived as adequate but did not sufficiently address the overwhelming increase in students’ autonomy and decrease in social relatedness. Students’ self-regulation skills as well as skills to initiate and maintain social contacts for interactive learning activities and for motivational support emerged as crucial aspects. Many students were not able to cope appropriately and students’ need satisfaction during emergency online teaching appeared to be related to students’ prior need satisfaction resulting in five groups of students, with two being relatively resilient and three being vulnerable to the disruptions of regular onsite teaching. Implications for further research and practice are discussed. • First year students experienced overwhelming autonomy during emergency online teaching. • Students struggled with maintaining social contacts for learning and motivational support. • Coping abilities are related to earlier study related psychological need satisfaction. • Lacking internet and concurrence of learning and home space are major problems. • Teaching via webinars provides structure, but interactive teaching forms are needed."

Within these conditions of distress and uncertainty, education authorities had no choice but to move traditional classes into online ones to ensure the sustainability of studies. The abrupt inevitable decision has been a first for most if not all teachers and students who are invited to cope with a totally new teaching/learning model without necessarily having prior experience in Distance Learning in terms of apparatus or techniques. This study comes as an in-progress appraisal of the D-learning scenarios proposed by Moulay Ismail University (MIU) in Meknes, Morocco, based on a two-level evaluation model (Reaction and Learning) proposed by Daniel Kirkpatrick. It is a real-time evaluation of a learning strategy that has long been considered optional for some students, to become, rather, a plan A constituent for many education departments around the world. The study investigates areas of success and failure from the students’ perspective via 4 sub-indicators: accessibility, autonomy, retention and psychological impact. The study concludes that the figures can be more reassuring about the D-learning experience in MIU once issues related to connectivity and communication are redressed.

Mouzakis \nIn this review, the latest research on wearable chemosensors is presented. In focus are the results from open literature, mainly from the last three years. The progress in wearable chemosensors is presented with attention drawn to the measuring technologies, their ability to provide robust data, the manufacturing techniques, as well their autonomy and ability to produce power. However, from statistical studies, the issue of patients’ trust in these technologies has arisen. People do not trust their personal data be transferred, stored, and processed through the vastness of the internet, which allows for timely diagnosis and treatment. The issue of power consumption and autonomy of chemosensor-integrated devices is also studied and the most recent solutions to this problem thoroughly presented."

Commercially available digital health technologies (DHTs - e.g. smartphones, smartwatches and apps) may hold significant potential in healthcare upon successful and constructive implementation. Literature on the topic is split between enthusiasm associated with potential benefits and concerns around privacy, reliability and overall effectiveness. However, little is known about what healthcare professionals (HCPs) have experienced so far with patients and what they perceive as the main advantages and disadvantages of adoption. This study therefore aims to investigate current perceptions of HCPs towards self-tracked health-related outputs from devices and apps available to the public.Nine HCPs volunteered to take part in semi-structured interviews. Related data were thematically analysed, following a deductive approach with the construction of a framework based on expected themes from the relevant literature, and themes identified from the first two interviews.The following main themes in relation to DHTs were identified and explored in detail: HCPs’ experience, knowledge and views; advantages and disadvantages; barriers towards healthcare implementation and potential solutions; future directions. While most participants were adopters of DHTs and held positive views about them, their overall experience with patients and the technology was limited. Potential reasons for this were explored, including factors such as time/resources; colleagues’ mindset; lack of evidence of effectiveness for practice; data security concerns.The potential advantages of DHTs’ adoption in healthcare are substantial, e.g. patient autonomy, time/resources saving, health and behaviour change promotion, but are presently premature. Therefore, future research is warranted, focussing on addressing barriers, minimising disadvantages, and assessing the clinical value of commercially available DHTs."

As one of these many teaching processes is the method known as e-learning, which has become more valuable and very important in these times due to the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The research method applied is descriptive, correlational, cross-sectional and predictive. The sample applied in this research is 608 students of the 5th grade of secondary education in the province of Sullana, Piura region of Peru. The results reveal the existence of a very significant influence in almost all the dimensions of the study. The dimensions with the highest association values are participation-autonomy, outcome resolution, decision concepts and decision outcomes. The dimensions with the lowest strength of association are undoubtedly the motivation rating, which can be interpreted as meaning that motivation does not have a strong influence on the results. It can be concluded that the application of the e-learning method in the teaching of 5th grade high school students in the area of mathematics is positively valued, although a strong incidence of the method on the grades is not observed, due to the fact that a lower percentage of students were unaware of the application of information and communication technologies for online learning. In addition, women tend to rate autonomy and participation more positively than men when the aforementioned teaching method is applied."

A traditional message emphasized the benefits of avoiding SMU, whereas a values-alignment message framed controlling SMU as being consistent with autonomy and social justice. Compared to no message or a traditional message, in both studies, a values-alignment message led to greater motivation to control SMU immediately afterward, and in Study 2, awareness of “addictive” social media designs 3 months later. As hypothesized, values-alignment messaging was more motivating for girls than boys. Results offer preliminary support for leveraging adolescents’ drives for autonomy and social justice to motivate self-regulation of SMU."

Despite extensive prior studies, the concept lacks theoretical logic and empirical validation regarding the role of an intentional act in the relationship between serendipitous encounters and their favorable outcomes. Drawing from self-determination theory, we develop a model that highlights the role of needs satisfaction in explaining this relationship. Positioning the empirical context to fortunate discoveries of information and social connections in professional use of Twitter, we validate the model by a cross-sectional survey study of 473 users. The model builds on the observation that individuals’ serendipitous encounters are associated with Twitter-enabled innovation, that is, a contextualized form of task innovation. The study findings support the research model revealing that serendipitous encounters are positively associated with needs satisfaction and that needs satisfaction is positively associated with Twitter-enabled innovation. In other words, fortunate discoveries of new information and contacts increase Twitter users’ intent to utilize the platform in new ways to accomplish work when the three key psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness are satisfied."

What has remained slightly unexplored, on the other hand, are the constitutional side effects of the combined operation of the two judgments on the relationship between the right to an effective remedy and Member States’ procedural autonomy. In its first part, therefore, this article will review the unusual procedural path that, on the basis of the first Schrems ruling, brought the second Schrems case from the Irish Data Protection Commissioner to the Court. The second part will examine the consequences of the two judgments on effective judicial protection, in particular on the extent to which those appear to create an obligation for the Member States to provide new remedies where the rights of individuals are infringed by secondary EU law."

We analyzed 3,633 online comments published between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2019, using thematic analysis. The findings revealed eight major themes: economic consequences; gender; stereotypes; awareness and education; independence and autonomy; medical standpoint; media portrayal; and social justice and accommodation. Further, our study found that 47% of online commenters from The NYT and 49.3% from The Guardian had a positive perception that PWDs should have equal access to sexual reproductive health, compared with non-disabled people. Our study also revealed that comments in The NYT were more focused on the legal issues in the United States, while comments in The Guardian emphasized positive media representation and human aspects of the issue."

We suggested a model consisting of four psychological barriers: Autonomy Loss, Privacy Invasion, Interpersonal Distrust, and Data Misuse. Perceived Financial Benefit was included as a main incentive for collaborative car use. Using two samples, a community (N = 176) and a student sample (N = 265), three forms of peer-to-peer collaborative car use were examined: lending your own car to another private person (Lending To), renting a car from another private person (Renting From) and sharing rides with others (Ridesharing). For all three forms, a standardised questionnaire was developed which included the psychological barriers, self-reported collaborative car use intention and behaviour, and evaluations of scenarios. The results showed that different barriers predicted specific forms of collaborative car use: Autonomy Loss was connected negatively with Ridesharing and Privacy Invasion predicted Lending To negatively. Data Misuse was related negatively with Renting From, when the renting was arranged via internet. Interpersonal Distrust showed no predictive value for collaborative car use. Perceived Financial Benefit was a consistent incentive for all forms of collaborative car use. Overall, the results confirm the relevance of psychological barriers for collaborative car use. Practical implications to overcome the psychological barriers are discussed."

Stephenson \n Larry Rifkin \n Guy Hindley \n John Dawson \n Alex Ruck Keene \n\nSummary\n\n\nBackground\n\nSelf-binding directives instruct clinicians to overrule treatment refusal during future severe episodes of illness. These directives are promoted as having the potential to increase autonomy for individuals with severe episodic mental illness. Although lived experience is central to their creation, the views of service users on self-binding directives have not been investigated substantially. This study aimed to explore whether reasons for endorsement, ambivalence, or rejection given by service users with bipolar disorder can address concerns regarding self-binding directives, decision-making capacity, and human rights.\n\nMethods\n\nThis qualitative study used data from an internet-based survey distributed to the mailing list of the UK charity Bipolar UK, which contained multiple closed and open questions on advance decision making for patients with bipolar disorder. We included participants who reported that they have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder by a professional (doctor or psychiatrist). In a previous study, quantitative analysis of a closed question about self-binding directives had shown endorsement among a high proportion of participants with bipolar disorder who completed the survey. In this study, we did a thematic analysis of responses from those participants who answered a subsequent open question about reasons for their view. Research was done within a multidisciplinary team, including team members with clinical, legal, and ethical expertise, and lived experience of bipolar disorder. Ideas and methods associated with all these areas of expertise were used in the thematic analysis to gain insight into the thoughts of individuals with bipolar disorder about self-binding directives and associated issues.\n\nFindings\n\nBetween Oct 23, 2017, and Dec 5, 2017, 932 individuals with a self-reported clinical diagnosis of bipolar disorder completed the internet survey, with 565 individuals (154 men, 400 women, 11 transgender or other), predominantly white British, providing free-text answers to the open question. 463 (82%) of the 565 participants endorsed self-binding directives, of whom 411 (89%) describing a determinate shift to distorted thinking and decision making when unwell as their key justification. Responses indicating ambivalence (37 [7%) of the 565 responses) were dominated by logistical concerns about the drafting and implementation of self-binding directives, whereas those who rejected self-binding directives (65 [12%] of the 565 responses) cited logistical concerns, validity of their thinking when unwell, and potential contravention of human rights.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThis study is, to our knowledge, the first large study assessing the reasons why mental health service users might endorse or reject the use of self-binding directives. The findings provide empirical support for introducing self-binding directives into mental health services as well as advance decision-making practice and policy, and might help address enduring ethical concerns surrounding possible implementation of the directive while a person retains decision-making capacity. The opinions expressed here in responses given by multiple service users with bipolar disorder challenge a prominent view within international disability rights debates that involuntary treatment and recognition of impaired mental capacity constitute inherent human rights violations.\n\nFunding\n\nThe Wellcome Trust."

English teachers have to switch over to hi tech-based productive teaching methods from the conventional chalk and board method which no longer appeals to students of an entirely new generation of English learners with changing needs. Facebook, the most widely used type of social networking service, can be explored as an alternative learner- friendly mode of learning English. Irrespective of social status, most of the students own mobile phones with net facilities and students can be motivated to use them for improving their communication skills while they enjoy communicating with their circle of friends the matters that matter most to them. This paper proposes to examine the viability of the use of facebook as a strategy of doing (communicating) as learning (English) to improve students’ conversational, commentary, and information-sharing skills in English and to assess how it contributes to learner autonomy. The central hypothesis of the proposed paper is that students enjoy communicating through facebook their thoughts, feelings, and values and they do not feel any constraints in doing so. The very act of communicating that they are reluctant in formal classroom atmosphere becomes a rewarding experience and motivating factor. The proposed study intends to employ empirical method for collection and interpretation of data."

Regan \nInformation posted by youth in online social media contexts is regularly accessed, downloaded, integrated, and analyzed by academic researchers. The practice raises significant social justice considerations for researchers including issues of representation and equitable distribution of risks and benefits. Use of this type of data for research purposes helps to ensure representation in research of the voices of (sometimes marginalized) youth who participate in these online contexts, at times discussing issues that are also under-represented. At the same time, youth whose data are harvested are subject (often without notice or consent) to the risks associated with this research, while receiving little if any direct benefit from the work. These risks include the potential loss of online social community as well as threats to participant rights and wellbeing. This paper explores the tension between the social justice benefit of representation and considerations that would suggest caution, the latter including inequitable distribution of research-related costs and benefits, and the traditional ethics concerns of participant autonomy and privacy in the context of youth participation in online discussions. In the final section, we propose guidelines and considerations for the conduct of online social media research to assist researchers to balance and respect representational and participant rights or wellbeing considerations, especially with youth."

Such memes were randomly selected by searching the words “elderly” and “quarantine”. In order to analyze as much material as possible, nineteen memes were selected. Content analysis, as proposed by Bardin, was used to investigate data supported by QSR NVivo® software. Results: Two categories for analysis emerged from the connection observed on the content of the memes selected: the elderly stigmatization and their autonomy denial. Final Considerations: The analysis of the study allowed interpreting that aged people have been constantly experiencing symbolic violence linked to COVID-19 on social media."

Francis \n Leslie P. Francis \nAbstract Freedom of thought is not directly protected as a right in the United States. Instead, US First Amendment law protects a range of rights that may allow thoughts to be expressed. Freedom of speech has been granted especially robust protection. US courts have extended this protection to a wide range of commercial activities judged to have expressive content. In protecting these rights, US jurisprudence frequently relies on the image of the marketplace of ideas as furthering the search for truth. This commercial image, however, has increasingly detached expressive rights from the understanding of freedom of thought as a critical forum for individual autonomy. Indeed, the commercialisation of US free speech doctrine has drawn criticism for “weaponising” free speech to attack disfavoured economic and regulatory policies and thus potentially affecting freedom of thought adversely. The Internet complicates this picture. This paper argues that the Supreme Court’s expansion of the First Amendment for the benefit of commercial actors lies in the problematic tension with the justification for individual freedom of thought resting in personal self-direction and identity."

The introduction of the Paradigm of Autonomy and arguments for moving away from this view to one of collaboration and inclusion is framed within the context of educational outcomes and assessment. Research has shown that limited work has been done across institutions in developing “shared” outcomes and assessment across curriculum and “values.” The Electronic Portfolio (utilization of the Internet as a platform for wide distribution and discussion of materials) is introduced as a mechanism to harness information technology for achieving the objectives of developing discourse on achieving acceptance of wide-ranging outcomes and assessment measures. The involvement of all stakeholders in the process, particularly those beyond the academy, is seen as an integral part of building an emerging paradigm of collaboration and inclusion in the development of shared outcomes and assessment metrics. The use of the Electronic Portfolio as the information technology vehicle is described in some detail."

We describe personality by using the Five-Factor Model and achieve autonomy through a goal-oriented approach. Each character perceives the surrounding world, decides how to behave and acts on the environment according to its personality and to its goals. The chief idea explored by the proposed approach is that personality has a probabilistic influence on behavior selection instead of a deterministic one. Different behavior sequences available to achieve a goal are modeled using probabilistic automata and making probability dependent on character personality. This leads to non-repetitive behaviors, whose evolution is not foreseeable. The paper first motivates the approach in the context of cybertherapy. Then, it summarizes related work and illustrates in detail the proposed approach. Finally, it presents obtained results and discusses the main limitations of the implemented system.

Antle \n Alexandra Kitson \nDriven by the rapid pace of technical innovation in biosensing, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things and wearable computing, the next generation of smart devices will be worn on-body, eventually becoming implanted. The increasing presence of these new forms of interactive technologies, known as biowearables , in children’s lives poses critical ethical concerns. In this position paper, we take a design ethics perspective to identify and describe four cases of ethical importance associated with biowearables, children, and long-term use. The cases concern potential negative impacts of specific aspects of biowearables on children’s identity formation, the development of autonomy and agency , and what sources of information children turn to for authority about themselves. Drawing on ethical discourse related to emerging technologies and biowearable computing, we present prospective guidance for designers, where it is available. Where guidance is nascent or missing, we propose future research areas that could be addressed. In particular, we propose the importance of teaching children about computer ethics through hands-on critical reflection during design and technology activities. Our results will be of interest to the human–computer interaction community as well as to technology developers, educators, parents and those involved in policy formation around emerging technologies."

However, limited academic research has been done to validate empirically artificial autonomy and its downstream consequences on human behavior. This study investigates the role of artificial autonomy by dividing it into three types of autonomy in terms of task primitives, namely, sensing, thought, and action autonomy. Drawing on mind perception theory, the authors hypothesize that the two fundamental dimensions of humanlike perceptions—competence and warmth—of non-human entities could explain the mechanism between artificial autonomy and IPA usage. Our results reveal that the comparative effects of competence and warmth perception exist when artificial autonomy contributes to users’ continuance usage intention. Theoretically, this study increases our understanding of AI-enabled artificial autonomy in information systems research. These findings also provide insightful suggestions for practitioners regarding AI artifacts design."

Data were accumulated in a netnographic manner. Processing (text, visual and audio-visual) data and their interpretation was performed by a qualitative content analysis, which revealed many peculiar manifestations of children’s culture. This includes an absence of temporal and spatial boundaries of children’s culture, the mediated nature of its members’ contacts, the involvement of children in the network, the existence of culture in external memory, the electronic character of culture creations and their ephemeral and peculiar nature. This indicates the new, digital nature of children’s culture, which seems to produce an increase in children’s community-related actions and strengthens their autonomy and their resistance potential towards the school and increases their participation in the digital culture, which serves to break down barriers between children."

Consequently, employees face additional cognitive demands to plan, structure, and coordinate their work. To capture these demands of contemporary work, we constructed and initially validated the Cognitive Demands of Flexible Work (CODE) scale. The scale comprises four subscales (i.e., structuring of work tasks, planning of working times, planning of working places, and coordinating with others). We initially validated the scale in three independent studies (overall N = 1,129) in German and English. Confirmatory factor analyses supported the four-factor structure, as well as scalar invariance, of the different language versions. Moreover, the subscales showed convergent and divergent validity with related constructs such as requirements for problem solving or autonomy. The criterion validity for emotional exhaustion, engagement, positive work rumination, negative work rumination, and problem-solving pondering suggested that cognitive demands of flexible work can be construed as challenge demands. However, relationships with emotional exhaustion were not significant. Overall, the CODE scale was shown to be a reliable and valid instrument to measure cognitive demands of flexible work."

A total of 6980 scientific publications retrieved from the Scopus database (1950–2020), evidencing a sharp research increase in 2003–2004. Clustering analysis of countries collaborations showed two major Asian-North America and European clusters. Three significant areas appeared: (i) energy provision, whose advancement mainly relies on microbial fuel cells, (ii) biomaterials for not yet fully operational soft-robotic solutions; and finally (iii), design and control, chiefly oriented to locomotor designs. In this scenario, marine biomimicking robotics still lacks solutions for the long-lasting energy provision, which presently hinders operation autonomy. In the research environment, identifying natural processes by which living organisms obtain energy is thus urgent to sustain energy-demanding tasks while, at the same time, the natural designs must increasingly inform to optimize energy consumption."

Along with that phenomenon, there is a global trend towards the creation of smart cities in many countries. Looking at the overview of studies and reports on smart cities, it can be seen that the concept of “smart city” is not clearly defined. Information and communication technology have often been being recognized by the vast majority of agencies, authorities and people when thinking about smart city but the meaning of smart city goes beyond that. Smart city concept should come with the emphasizing on the role of social resources and smart urban governance in the management of urban issues. Therefore, the “smart city” label should refer to the capacity of smart people and smart officials who create smart urban governance solutions for urban problems. The autonomy in smart cities allows its members (whether individuals or the community in general) of the city to participate in governance and management of the city and become active users and that is the picture of e-democracy. E-democracy makes it easier for stakeholders to become more involved in government work and fosters effective governance by using the IT platform of smart city. This approach will be discussed more in this paper."

    "text": "Doc 1400 :  Paradigm Shift in English Language Learning from Textbook to Facebook \nhttps://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3487654\n John Sekar Jeyaraj \nTechnology has posed many challenges to the teaching methods and materials of English as a second language. English teachers need to switch over to hi tech-based productive teaching methods from the conventional chalk and board method which no longer appeals to students of an entirely new generation of English learners with changing needs. Facebook, the most widely used type of social networking service, can be explored as an alternative learner- friendly mode of learning English outside classroom. Irrespective of social status, most students own (smart) mobile phones with the internet connectivity and they can be motivated to use it for improving their communication skills while they enjoy communicating with their circle of friends the matters that matter most to them. This paper proposes to examine the viability of the use of Facebook as a strategy of doing (communicating) as learning (English) to improve students’ conversational, commentary, and information-sharing skills in English and to assess how it contributes to learner autonomy. The central hypothesis of the proposed paper is that students enjoy communicating through Facebook their thoughts, feelings, and values and they do not feel any constraints in doing so. The very act of communicating that they are reluctant in formal classroom atmosphere becomes a rewarding experience and motivating factor in the virtual world. The proposed study intends to employ empirical method for collection and interpretation of data."

However, because of the flexible concepts of the civil law codifications a disruptive effect in the private law until now did not exist. Especially the legal consequences of the internet were integrated into the private law without bigger categorial or structural changes. This applies equally to most of the cases of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in recent times. With more advanced development of AI-systems, though, it may not be possible anymore to apply the traditional terms of the private law to the use of AI without leaving the constitutional law background of the private law. This article discusses the impact of the use of a future advanced independent AI on the concept of the private autonomy in the contract law. Furthermore, it gives an overview on the new legislative approach of a human centric use of AI in the European Union."

Its aim is twofold: first, it supports a different perspective on privacy that focuses on the individual’s process of identity construction considering the social and personal aspects of ‘fashion’. Second, it underlines the limitations of computational models in capturing the diverse meaning of ‘fashion’, whereby the algorithmic prediction of user preferences is based on individual conscious and unconscious associations with fashion identity. I test both of these claims in the context of current concerns over the impact of algorithmic personalisation systems on individual autonomy and privacy: creating ‘filter bubbles’, nudging the user beyond their conscious awareness, as well as the inherent bias in algorithmic decision-making. We need an understanding of privacy that sustains the inherent reduction of fashion identity to literal attributes and protects individual autonomy in shaping algorithmic approximations of the self."

The evolution and qualitative dynamics of the EU cyber policy from the adoption of the first legal acts in the early 2000s to the publication of the second EU Security Strategy draft in December 2020 are analyzed. The study found that the European Union has the potential to achieve strategic autonomy in cyberpolitics. However, it needs a more coherent policy of coordination, further increase of funding and building of institutional capacity of the EU, equalization of member states possibilities. The conclusions state that Europe is interested in the comprehensive development of EU cybersecurity policy. The cross-border nature of cyber threats means that the EU’s resilience in this matter directly affects its security. The current direction of the EU’s capacity building and especially close cooperation with NATO provide a chance to avoid difficult political dilemmas. Official data from the European Union’s Cyber Security Agency show that the number of violations of privacy is growing among the types of cyber attacks. This puts on the agenda the activities of EU structures and Member States the need to develop a system of human rights protection in the field of cybersecurity. One of its basic elements should be updated legislation, in particular, the new EU Cyber Security Strategy. The European Union does not stop there and constantly strives to develop opportunities to counter and prevent cyber threats in order to achieve strategic autonomy of the organization. The EU needs to overcome its excessive bureaucratization and imbalance in the funding of cyber policy management programs and the practical development of cyber attack protection, prevention and repulsion systems. The EU’s place in the future global cybersecurity system will depend on the real strengthening of this second segment of programs."

The steady growth in the availability and, as a result, the prevalence of high-speed Internet, the increasing level of autonomy of production and logistics, and the development of digital infrastructure lead to a complex transformation of both markets and industries in general and consumer groups, manufacturers, and retailers in particular. The result of these processes is a radical transformation of the complex of demanded knowledge, skills, and abilities. However, the labor market is formed under the influence of both economic and social processes, which significantly increases its complexity as an object of analysis. The multidimensional impact of digital transformation on the labor market is ambiguous, and the potential synergistic effect of the impact of particular manifestations of digital transformation processes can be both positive and negative. The consequences of such a transformation can be revolutionary. Thus, the problem of effective assessment of the consequences of labor market transformation under the influence of digitalization is extremely relevant. The purpose of this work is to formalize the mathematical vectors of influence of digitalization factors on the development of the labor market. To achieve this goal, digitalization is presented in the form of quantified factors expressed using specific indicators, and the unemployment rate is used as an indicator of the labor market. The main research tool is the regression analysis. As a result, a regression model is obtained that expresses the dualistic nature of the impact of digitalization on the development of the labor market"

It was found that in each university the determinant of the rating policy is Development Strategy, according to which the evaluation of research and teaching staff is positioned as an important procedure for internal quality assurance of higher education and a factor in stimulating professional development of teachers.\n Based on a comparative analysis of the regulatory framework, criteria, indicators and evaluation procedures inherent in different institutions of higher education, common features and characteristics of rating evaluation of research and teaching staff. The personal and institutional dimensions of the significance of various evaluation of the activity of scientific and pedagogical workers are revealed. Emphasis is placed on modern indicators and problematic evaluation issues identified in the process of studying domestic practices. Insufficient use of information collected through rating assessment for prognostic purposes is emphasized.\n The tendency of updating criteria and indicators of a rating estimation of activities carried out by scientific and pedagogical workers of universities is established.

A Paternalizing Look into the Consent-Based Platform Work Economy \nhttps://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3383159\n Marta Santos Silva \n Mijke Houwerzijl \nThe role of the traditional labour market has been changed by globalisation and modern technology, particularly by the unprecedented and generalised use of smartphones. The platform economy, also called “gig economy” is radically changing the rights and duties of service providers, as it is associated with a high degree of flexibility and profit maximisation, which suppresses or significantly limits traditional workers’ rights, such as the right to paid holiday, maternity license or unemployment benefits.\nThis paper focuses on Uber, the current international market leader on online ridesourcing platforms, and the impact they have on gig workers that chose to enter the platform. Online ridesourcing platforms assign private drivers to rides booked and paid for by passengers through an app. The platform’s drivers may vary from ‘genuine’ freelance business owners, ‘multiple jobholders’, “moonlight” workers to workers who opted for working full-time as gig workers.\nAmong the latter are former professional riders or amateur riders who were unable to cope with the tight restrictions of a heavily regulated professional passenger transportation sector, high-priced licenses, inefficient work-life balance policies and lack of safety guarantees. A sector of the scholarship argues that the conditions offered by platforms to drivers encourage entrepreneurship across all segments of society and foster the decentralization of economic growth. In fact, on-demand ridesharing platforms adapt the drivers’ income to the market, providing for primetime pricing to meet increased demand. Additionally, by allowing for a flexible work schedule, they are deemed to promote work-life balance. Finally, by integrating technology they ensure a more efficient provision of services and a safer one as well, with passenger registration, money-free rides and GPS location as integral part of the operation. The wider majority of the scholarship, however, has been heavily criticizing these platform services for infringing workers’ rights.\nIf there is an almost consensus in the scholarship that gig workers have been opting for entering a labour economy which will affect them, their families and other parts of the working population in the mid or long-run, the question is asked whether it is justified for regulators to nudge such workers into taking decisions (or imposing these upon them) which are better for their own welfare and the decent living standard of other workers. In other words, what should be the balance between respecting the autonomy of ‘gig-workers’ in grasping their chances to access the ‘gig-labour market’ and taking paternalizing measures to protect ‘gig-workers’ against ‘self-exploitation’?"

This paper contrasts between the cyber-governance approaches adopted by two non-Western regional organizations, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Gulf Cooperation Council, over the past decade. Considering their similar institutional origins, Most Similar Systems Design methodology was employed to assess how ASEAN and GCC have distinctly responded to cybercrime. It considers the dynamics of the digital divide — a divide which is exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic — and in which ASEAN and the GCC are challenged to bolster their cyber-capabilities. Findings reveal that GCC increasingly diffuses norms of international cooperation to tackle cybercrime. By contrast, ASEAN embodies cyber norms which regulate behavior along the lines of intra-regional cooperation, wherein norms of international cooperation are rendered subsidiary to norms of regional autonomy."

It is hoped that such a framework can inform pragmatic discussions of ethical and regulatory norms in a proactive way. Issues raised by autonomous systems in the physical and cyber realms are distinct; however, discussions about the norms and laws governing these two related manifestations of autonomy can and should inform one another. Therefore, this paper emphasizes the factors that distinguish autonomous systems in cyberspace, labeled disembodied autonomous systems, from systems that physically exist in the form of embodied autonomous systems. By highlighting the distinguishing factors of these two forms of autonomy, this paper informs the extension of our assessment tool to software systems, bringing us into the legal and ethical discussions of autonomy in cyberspace."

Wilson \n Deborah Richards \nThe ethical issues raised by cybersecurity practices and technologies are of critical importance. However, there is disagreement about what is the best ethical framework for understanding those issues. In this paper we seek to address this shortcoming through the introduction of a principlist ethical framework for cybersecurity that builds on existing work in adjacent fields of applied ethics, bioethics, and AI ethics. By redeploying the AI4People framework, we develop a domain-relevant specification of five ethical principles in cybersecurity: beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice, and explicability. We then illustrate the advantages of this principlist framework by examining the ethical issues raised by four common cybersecurity contexts: penetration testing, distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS), ransomware, and system administration. These case analyses demonstrate the utility of this principlist framework as a basis for understanding cybersecurity ethics and for cultivating the ethical expertise and ethical sensitivity of cybersecurity professionals and other stakeholders."

Cybernetic governance is a structure, process of a system to empower greater decision making, autonomy, leadership, and greater accountability. Thus, cybernetic approach is heavily depending on information, utilise information for decision making, policy making and feedback to respond effectively. The concept also relevant with co-production strategy, whereby public services offered at the institution would focus on making use of resources through community building, collaboration, and resource sharing. In this context, “governance” refers to the role of multi-stakeholders involved in decision making, autonomy, leadership, and accountability. The effectiveness and success of this cybernetic governance depends on the institution community; the board, Vice-Chancellor, university management committee, Deans and Directors involved. The main idea is to analyse cybernetic governance as a model for processing information and a platform for co-production on governance empowerment at higher education institutions in Malaysia. Hence literatures are reviewed to apply the concepts to this research. An expected outcome of this research would be the evidence to improve policy performance in governance arrangements. Therefore, cybernetic governance contribution is the practice of good governance for intelligent institutions."

The priority value of the information resource and knowledge in the activities of industrial enterprises is determined both by the prospects for the development of science-intensive products and their competitiveness in the world and domestic markets, and by the desire to ensure the stable operation of the enterprise in a highly disturbed business environment. With the search and analysis of the dependences of the production, financial and economic processes taking place in them on the control information, the systemic interaction of the enterprise resources and the dynamics of key indicators of the activity of industrial enterprises are revealed.From the standpoint of thermodynamics, statistical physics and cybernetics, it is proposed to spread the information concept of V. Trapeznikov to substantiate and modelling the dependence of a number of economic and financial indicators on the amount of accumulated information in the controlled complex of an industrial enterprise.Modeling and interpretation of the relationship between the volume of control information with the uncertainty of the functioning of an industrial enterprise and the achieved level of knowledge about it is carried out. The condition for the stability of the indicator of the effect of activity and the financial stability of the enterprise (autonomy ratio) is formulated. The mathematical condition for the range of changes in the level of knowledge of industrial enterprises has been substantiated."

Employee with large amount of autonomy may willingly invest efforts and persist in the face of obstacles which are strong indicator of engagement. Also, high performing leadership finds intolerable bulling, but promotes job autonomy, performance management, and employee assistance programmes and the institutions cannot boast of one. Various recommendations including the institution promotion and encouragement of employee assistance programme were given. Work itself, leadership, work environment, and opportunity for growth were strategic directions for improvement.

Lilja \n Mirna Rupcic Ljustina \n Linnea Nissling \n Anna Caroline Larsson \n Sandra Weineland \nBackground: Anxiety is common among youths in primary care. Face-to-face treatment has been the first choice for clinicians, but during the COVID-19 pandemic, digital psychological interventions have substantially increased. Few studies have examined young people’s interest in internet treatment or the attitudes they and their parents have toward it. Objective: This study aims to investigate adolescents’ and parents’ attitudes toward and experiences of internet-based cognitive behavioral anxiety treatment in primary care and its presumptive effects. Methods: The study used mixed methods, analyzing qualitative data thematically and quantitative data with nonparametric analysis. Participants were 14 adolescents and 14 parents recruited in adolescent primary health care clinics. The adolescents and their parents filled out mental health questionnaires before and after treatment, and were interviewed during ongoing treatment. Results: The quantitative data indicated that the internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy program used in this study was successful in reducing symptoms (χ22=8.333; P=.02) and that adolescents’ motivation is essential to the treatment outcome (r=0.58; P=.03). The qualitative results show that youths highly value their independence and freedom to organize treatment work on their own terms. The parents expressed uncertainty about their role and how to support their child in treatment. It was important for parents to respect the youths’ need for autonomy while also engaging with them in the treatment work. Conclusions: Internet treatment in primary care is accepted by both youths and their parents, who need clarification about the difference between their role and the therapist’s role. Patient motivation should be considered before treatment, and therapists need to continue to develop the virtual alliance. Finally, primary care should be clearer in informing adolescents and their parents about the possibility of internet treatment."

One such emergent technology is the digital twin which we define here as a living replica of a physical system (human or non-human). A digital twin combines various emerging technologies such as AI, Internet of Things, big data and robotics, each component bringing its own socio-ethical issues to the resulting artefacts. The question thus arises which of these socio-ethical themes surface in the process and how they are perceived by stakeholders in the field. In this report we present the results of a qualitative study into the socio-ethical benefits and socio-ethical risks of using digital twins in healthcare. Employing insights from ethics of technology and the Quadruple Helix theory of innovation, we conducted desk research of white literature and 23 interviews with representatives from the four helixes: industry, research, policy and civil society. The ethical scan revealed several important areas where the digital twin can produce socio-ethical value (e.g., prevention and treatment of disease, cost reduction, patient autonomy and freedom, equal treatment) but also several important areas of socio-ethical risks (e.g., privacy and property of data, disruption of existing societal structures, inequality and injustice). We conclude with a reflection on the employed analytical tool and suggestions for further research."

However, during COVID-19, CDC passed a directive to ECE to pause family style meal service. Therefore, we conducted an ECE webinar focused on how to feed children responsively during plated meal service to help providers support children’s autonomy and self-regulation.\n\nObjective\n\nTo evaluate changes in the level of understanding, behavioral intention to implement knowledge, and confidence about how to feed children (2-5 years) responsively during plated meal service. Also, to determine need for future training opportunities.\n\nStudy Design, Setting, Participants\n\nRetrospective pretest-posttest study. The webinar was advertised through an email newsletter disseminated by a national-level platform, Penn State Extension Better Kid Care. Participants attended the online webinar for 1 hour on August 11, 2020, had access to an Extension publication (http://bit.ly/3pnJ71X) and responded to a follow-up survey (Qualtrics Link: http://bit.ly/3jMWvvv). Participants identified themselves as either ECE providers (n = 77) or other stakeholders (n = 30), who can offer opportunities or guidance to providers.\n\nMeasurable Outcome/Analysis\n\nChange in self-reported evaluation score (range 1=low to 7=high) for understanding, behavioral intention to implement knowledge, and confidence about how to feed children responsively during plated meal service. Paired sample t tests (alpha = 0.05) followed by Sidak-Bonferroni correction (adjusted P = 0.007).\n\nResults\n\nBoth providers and stakeholders reported significantly higher (P < 0.001) level of understanding, intention to implement knowledge obtained, and confidence regarding implementing responsive feeding during plated meal service after the webinar compared to before the webinar. Participants expressed need for online nutrition trainings with emerging themes such as feeding infants, safe food preparation and storage, flexibility of CACFP rules, and physical distance during meals.\n\nConclusion\n\nIntentional mealtime conversations, giving children small tasks supporting their autonomy, and setting clear expectations while adjusting mealtime routines can offer a promising avenue for implementing responsive feeding during plated meal service."

Mendzhul \nThe article examines the content and application of the principle of inadmissibility of interference in family life. It is established that the principle of inadmissibility of interference in family life is one of the key in family law and contains signs of intersectoral. Proper guarantee of non-interference in family life is an integral part of a person’s autonomy and an indicator of the state’s fulfillment of the obligation to regulate family relations only to a minimum.\n She studied the provisions of international acts (the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms) and the national legislation of Ukraine. It was found that different terminology is used in international and national acts, but the fixed concepts are meaningful content of the principle of inadmissibility of interference in family life.\n An analysis of the case law of the European Court of Human Rights on the understanding of the concept of “family life”. It has been established that the ECtHR interprets the term “family life” quite broadly and is not limited to marital relations, but may cover other actual “family ties”.\n Attention is drawn to the problem of collecting private information about a person via the Internet. Analysis of human activity on the Internet in general, as well as on social networks should not be carried out without his consent. That is why it is proposed at the level of legislation to provide for the obligation of both developers of computer programs that analyze human actions and collect information about them, and owners of sites on the Internet when visiting them to warn people that such actions can be traced.\n The positive responsibilities of the state to guarantee respect for family life, protection from others, as well as to establish legal certainty in family relations and protect the secrecy of family life were analyzed.\n It is substantiated that the principle of inadmissibility of interference in family life is a principle enshrined in written law, which provides for respect for family life, prohibition of any illegal, arbitrary interference in family life, as well as protection of the secrecy of family life."

A wide range of ethical concerns has arisen in their usage and development in recent years. Such concerns are exacerbated by the increasing autonomy given to connected things. This paper reviews, via examples, the landscape of ethical issues, and some recent approaches to address these issues concerning connected things behaving autonomously as part of the Internet of Things. We consider ethical issues in relation to device operations and accompanying algorithms. Examples of concerns include unsecured consumer devices, data collection with health-related Internet of Things, hackable vehicles, behaviour of autonomous vehicles in dilemma situations, accountability with Internet of Things systems, algorithmic bias, uncontrolled cooperation among things, and automation affecting user choice and control. Current ideas towards addressing a range of ethical concerns are reviewed and compared, including programming ethical behaviour, white-box algorithms, black-box validation, algorithmic social contracts, enveloping IoT systems, and guidelines and code of ethics for IoT developers; a suggestion from the analysis is that a multi-pronged approach could be useful based on the context of operation and deployment."

    "text": "Doc 1424 :  Usability of Smartbands by the Elderly Population in the Context of Ambient Assisted Living Applications \nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/electronics10141617\n Luis M. Correia \n Daniel Fuentes \n Jose Ribeiro \n Nuno Costa \n Arsénio Reis \n Carlos Rabadão \n João Barroso \n António Pereira \nNowadays, the Portuguese population is aging at a fast pace. The situation is more severe in the interior regions of the country, where the rural areas have few people and have been constantly losing population; these are mostly elderly who, in some cases, live socially isolated. They are also often deprived of some types of social, health and technological services. One of the current challenges with respect to the elderly is that of improving the quality of life for those who still have some autonomy and live in their own residences so that they may continue living autonomously, while receiving the assistance of some exterior monitoring and supporting services. The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm demonstrates great potential for creating technological solutions in this area as it aims to seamlessly integrate information technology with the daily lives of people. In this context, it is necessary to develop services that monitor the activity and health of the elderly in real time and alert caregivers or other family members in the case of an unusual event or behaviour. It is crucial that the technological system is able to collect data in a nonintrusive manner and without requiring much interaction with the elderly. Smartband devices are very good candidates for this purpose and, therefore, this work proposes assessing the level of acceptance of the usage of a smartbands by senior users in their daily activities. By using the definition of an architecture and the development of a prototype, it was possible to test the level of acceptance of smartbands by a sample of the elderly population—with surprising results from both the elderly and the caregivers—which constitutes an important contribution to the research field of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL). The evaluation showed that most users did not feel that the smartband was intrusive to their daily tasks and even considered using it in the future, while caregivers considered that the platform was very intuitive."

Social media has become one of the most important approaches for recruitment or intervention, increasing awareness and knowledge of health issues, and in uencing attitudes towards health behavior change. The following article is a narrative review of following subtopics: a) application of social media in public health research and b) role and application of ethical principles in social media based research and highlights the application of ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence and justice and surrounding issues faced by health education researchers while conducting health education research. We propose revisions to the code of ethics for health education specialists incor-porating application of ethical principles in social media usage."

Winans \nGrammarly’s Tone Detector is included in the free version of the application and is available for major phone and computer program platforms. Its strength is in helping students compose pragmatically appropriate texts which could substantially increase their confidence and the feeling of autonomy. It accomplishes this by providing writers with tone indications of their text paired with emojis to help navigate the sometimes opaque waters of pragmatics. However, this tool does not provide indications of which words or phrases contribute to an indicated tone, nor does it offer suggestions for improvement. It is a perpetual beta tool in that it asks for user input to continually adapt and learn to the changing communicative situation. Although there are some areas for improvement, it is a useful tool that teachers could recommend to their students to support their ability to raise their confidence about the pragmatic appropriateness when writing emails and other texts where pragmatics are important."

Physical and emotional changes, peers, social media, education, family expectations etc. make individuals vulnerable. Aims: To study the prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress in school going adolescents from 9th -12th standard from Bagdogra, to examine the association with family factors and Socio Economic Status and to identify the co-morbidities between Depression, Anxiety and Stress. Methods: A cross sectional study was carried out using DASS-21 scale on a total of 231 students. In addition, a self-structured questionnaire on family structure and socio economic status was administered and SPSS software was used for analysis. Result: Overall, 76.2% had at least one of the mental morbidities under study. Depression was significantly more common in class 12th, (28.4%), 9th (28.4%) &10th (27.6%) and stress was significantly common in 12th(55.4%) & 10th (55.2%). There was no significant difference in relation to age, sex, family structure and socioeconomic status. All mental morbidities more frequently occurred in combination with each other, rather than exclusively. Depression most frequently occurred with stress (8 times) followed by anxiety (4 times), whereas anxiety was 6 times more likely to occur with stress. Conclusions: Almost 3 out of 4 children had symptoms related to at least one of the mental morbidities discussed. Depression and stress was significantly more prevalent in students answering board exams (class 10th and 12th) than those not answering board exams. Depression, Anxiety and Stress were highly correlated with each other."

Australian companies may soon make similar offers. Employer-sponsored egg freezing (ESEF) has raised concerns and there is academic debate about whether ESEF promotes reproductive autonomy or reinforces the ‘career vs. family’ dichotomy. Despite the growing availability of ESEF and significant academic debate, little is known about how ESEF is perceived by the public. The aim of this study was to explore women’s attitudes toward ESEF.MethodsWomen aged 18-60 years who resided in Victoria, Australia were invited to complete an online, cross-sectional survey investigating views toward egg freezing. Associations between participant demographics and their views about ESEF were assessed using multinominal logistic regression, adjusted for age and free text comments were analyzed using thematic analysis.ResultsThe survey was completed by 656 women, median age 28 years (range: 18-60 years). Opinions on the appropriateness of employers offering ESEF were divided (Appropriate: 278, 42%; Inappropriate: 177, 27%; Unsure: 201, 31%). There was significantly less support for ESEF among older participants and those employed part-time (p < 0.05). While some participants saw the potential for ESEF to increase women’s reproductive and career options, others were concerned that ESEF could pressure women to delay childbearing and exacerbate existing inequities in access to ARTs.ConclusionsOur analysis revealed that while some women identified risks with ESEF, for many women ESEF is not viewed as theoretically wrong, but rather it may be acceptable under certain conditions; such as with protections around reproductive freedoms and assurances that ESEF is offered alongside other benefits that promote career building and family. We suggest that there may be a role for the State in ensuring that these conditions are met."

Based on different reports and studies, however, it seems that a decade after approval, not only the majority of its operational strategies have not been implemented, but its setting and establishment is still in a state of ambiguity. As school’s educational staff are the most crucial element of implementing such a document, this survey measures school readiness and staff familiarity. In this case, the survey method was used comprises the number of 129 educational staff working in public and private schools at different levels elementary, middle, and high schools including girls and boys) was studied in Tehran and Kerman provinces. Results showed that educational staff is familiar with the Fundamental Reform Document of Education, its theoretical foundation, and subsequently with its six subsystems, respectively. The readiness of schools to implement the Fundamental Reform Document of Education is also as follows: 81% for the relationship between schools and institutions, 77% for educational staffs readiness, 76% fostering affairs, 73% for the preparedness of classrooms, workshops, and laboratories, 72% for teachers with professional experiences, 71% for access to internet infrastructure, 66% for sports space, facilities, and equipment, 65% for schools’ institutional autonomy for decision-making, and 56% for financial resources. At the final stage of this article, we submitted a model for utilizing the school’s capacity to implement the Fundamental Reform Document of Education. https://dorl.net/dor /20.1001.1.20088302.2021.19.2.11.9"

Twenty-five students participated in the experimental study. Eleven students were willingly to be interviewed. Inferential statistical analysis was used to interpret the quantitative data collected from students’ essay writing scores. Meanwhile, the data obtained through observations and interviews was interpreted using qualitative coding analysis. The results of the inferential statistical analysis revealed that peer feedback activities conducted through asynchronous online interactions had more significant effects compared to those conducted face to face on students’ writing revision. Further, after conducting a thematic analysis, six themes emerged: 1) peer feedback activities could increase students’ autonomy in learning, 2) the teacher’s involvement in peer feedback activities was beneficial in terms of improving the consistency of feedback and revision, 3) peer feedback through asynchronous online interactions gave extra time to produce more beneficial comments, 4) peer feedback activities through asynchronous online interactions gave more chances to become a writing audience, 5) communicating via Facebook made the students feel awkward, and 6) recorded feedback via Facebook comments was more beneficial for students’ revision. The implication of the research is that teachers of English needs to consider asynchronous online interactions for students’ writing revision when teaching writing."

But what makes something rape? Initially, only penial-vagina forceful penetration; then, other forceful penial penetrations were added, oral and anal; and later the forceful insertion of inanimate objects as well. The requirement of using force lost its exclusiveness and much of its normative power, paving the way for other kinds of rape: sex by non-forceful coercion, sex by sedation, sex with incompetent victims, sex by fraud, and other forms of problematic sex. The normative debate about each form is ongoing, and in a manner of speaking, rape is a limitless idea. Where will the rape offense go next?\nCyberspace, apparently. The Israeli Supreme Court has recently affirmed convictions of rape performed by distant words. The perpetrators conversed with children, teenagers and adult women online, using fraud and blackmail to manipulate them into masturbation and self-penetration. This groundbreaking judicial development is the inspiration to a normative analysis, revolving around Western notions of rape. Should such ill-intended communications constitute rape?\nThe article will normatively scrutinize the virtual rape thesis. It will analytically deconstruct the normative notion of rape into three facets, and examine each separately: the physics of the offensive scenario; the settings thereof, the manner in which sexual autonomy is violated; and finally, the matter of proper criminal labeling. It will conclude that while sexual autonomy is indeed under attack in cyberspace, the framework of rape is unsuitable to handle this form of offensiveness."

The questionnaire was comprised of demographics, use patterns, and an instrument called TENS-Interface that measured the impact of technology on well-being categories of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Descriptive statistics, reliability, power analysis and bivariate correlations were calculated using SPSS statistical software. Three participants completed follow up semi-structured interviews, which were analysed for themes of technological mediation using NVivo 12 software.The TENS-Interface was validated for use with a legally blind population. Descriptive statistics showed a higher mean for autonomy than competence or relatedness. Braille was positively correlated to both autonomy and competence, while screen reader proficiency was related to competence. Daily use of social media, email, instant messaging, and video calls were correlated to relatedness. The technological devices used by interview participants were analysed for technological mediation. Training was identified as an additional theme.Recommendations for practice include providing training to legally blind adults in screen reader use and braille use to support well-being via competence and autonomy. Training is also recommended for this population in the use of social media, email, and video calls to promote well-being through opportunities for relatedness. Further research is recommended to explore instructional methods that are not only efficient, but also meaningful for older adults in the position of losing their vision.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONProviding access to braille instruction and braille assistive technology equipment can promote legally blind adults’ well-being by supporting their basic needs for both competence and autonomy.Providing training in screen reader use can promote legally blind adults’ well-being by supporting their basic need for competence.Providing training in use of email, social media, video calls, and instant messaging can promote legally blind adults’ well-being by supporting their basic need for relatedness.A consideration of technological mediation can allow practitioners to make recommendations that take into account not only efficient task completion, but issues related to meaning and social context.Instruction for adults losing their vision adventitiously needs to address not only efficient task performance, but also meaning and social context."

Public health communication targets enhancing collective compliance with protective health and safety regulations. Here, we asked whether authoritarian/controlling message framing as compared to a neutral message framing may be more effective than moralizing/prosocial message framing and whether recipients’ self-rated trait autonomy might lessen these effects. In a German sample (n = 708), we measured approval of seven regulations (e.g., reducing contact, wearing a mask) before and after presenting one of three Twitter messages (authoritarian, moralizing, neutral/control) presented by either a high-authority sender (state secretary) or a low-authority sender (social worker). We found that overall, the messages successfully increased participants’ endorsement of the regulations, but only weakly so because of ceiling effects. Highly autonomous participants showed more consistent responses across the two measurements, i.e., lower response shifting, in line with the concept of reactive autonomy. Specifically, when the sender was a social worker, response shifting correlated negatively with trait autonomy. We suggest that a trusted sender encourages more variable responses to imposed societal regulations in individuals low in autonomy, and we discuss several aspects that may improve health communication."

The university-wide inhibitors as identified by the study are non-provision or inadequacy of: funding, administrative and infrastructural supports, functional ICT laboratories/tools, ICT-compliant teaching staff and standby and responsive technical support for both teachers and students. Library schools’ inhibitors include poor maintenance culture, lack of Internet presence, dedicated bandwidth and active websites while the teaching and learning inhibitors highlighted by the study are (older) teachers’ poor attitude, concerns on how to retain the copyright of their lecture contents, plagiarism and the quality of students’ work; fear of additional workload which may result in stress and burnt-out; lack of freedom or teaching autonomy (as teaching may now take the collaborations of colleagues, computer experts and instructional/graphic designers); teachers’/students’ poor expertise and technology background and nature of course, among others. The author made suggestions on the way forward for an increased and a sustainable integration of ICTs in teaching and learning, especially in this Post-COVID-19 Pandemic Era where physical contact and interactions may need to be reduced to the barest minimum to contain contagious communication and consequent health hazards. This review has implications for library educators, students and educational managers in the universities of other developing countries."

This study used a two-wave design, with a final sample of 481 employees from an automobile company. The results indicate that enterprise social media use is positively related to both work overload and informational support. Work overload and informational support predicts job performance negatively and positively, respectively. Furthermore, work overload and informational support mediates the relationship between enterprise social media use and job performance. Job autonomy moderates the relationship between enterprise social media use and work overload and informational support. Therefore, this study provides a more balanced view of how enterprise social media use influences job performance by demonstrating the opposing mediating roles of work overload and informational support. Furthermore, this study fills the gap by taking job characteristics into more consideration when examining the boundary condition of enterprise social media use. Last, this study validates the generalization of job demands-resources model in social media research."

Grounded in the literature on online identity, this article examines how Tumblr users tactically use hashtagging architecture for publicity and privacy in self-expression. The analysis is based on Tumblr posts and their corresponding hashtags, combined with text-based, synchronous interviews with users. We find that participants use hashtags as a form of intimate expression, offering “secret whisper” spaces. Participants acknowledged a distinction between these spaces of intimacy and the more conventional space of the post. Extending on Goffman’s dramaturgical approach, we argue that this intimacy practice is a form of stage whispering, which is neither front- nor backstage, but implies and assumes intimacy while on the stage, as an actor might imply and assume intimacy stage whispering to her audience."

The mobile phone with the internet is an interesting and exciting language learning tool that offers myriad opportunities for English language learners outside the formal classroom. It also promotes learner autonomy and communication skills. Though some private educational institutions do not encourage students to use it on campus, it cannot be denied that it offers a lot of learning experiences to students as well as teachers on campus and off campus. It helps students spend leisure time more usefully and constructively chatting with and messaging to friends. Teachers and students of English can use it inside the classroom not only as a tool, but also a source of reliable information for learning English. It has unique features that textbooks and reference books lack. This study analyzes students’ views on the use of online chatting/messaging for promotion of ‘speech in writing’ as the third medium of communication that demolishes the man-made artificial division between speech and writing as modes of communication. The results of the survey are highly revealing, positive, and encouraging on the use of mobile phone for acquisition of communication skills in English."

Aligned with these considerations we emphasize the need to present from the viewpoint of ethics the risks of personalized ICT solutions that aim to remedy health and support the well-being of the ageing population at workplaces. The ethical boundaries of digital technologies are opaque. The main motivation is to cope with the uncertainties of workplaces’ digitization and develop an ethics framework, termed SmartFrameWorK, for personalized health support through ICT tools at workplace environments. SmartFrameWorK is built upon a five-dimensional approach of ethics norms: autonomy, privacy, transparency, trustworthiness and accountability to incite trust in digital workplace technologies. A typology underpins these principles and guides the ethical decision-making process with regard to older worker particular needs, context, data type-related risks and digital tools’ use throughout their lifecycle. Risk analysis of pervasive technology use and multimodal data collection, highlighted the imperative for ethically aware practices for older workers’ activity and behaviour monitoring. The SmartFrameWorK methodology has been applied in a case study to provide evidence that personalized digital services could elicit trust in users through a well-defined framework. Ethics compliance is a dynamic process from participants’ engagement to data management. Defining ethical determinants is pivotal towards building trust and reinforcing better workability and well-being in older workers."

To increase adherence, additional support for behavior change has been advocated. However, consistency in the reporting of interventions using behavior change techniques is lacking. Recently, a classification system has been developed to increase consistency in studies using behavior change techniques within the self-determination theory.This study aimed to explore expressions of self-determination among community-dwelling older adults using a self-managed digital fall prevention exercise program comprising behavior change support (the Safe Step program), which was developed in co-creation with intended users.The qualitative study design was based on open-ended responses to questionnaires, and individual and focus group interviews. A deductive qualitative content analysis was applied using the classification system of motivation and behavior change techniques as an analytical matrix, followed by an inductive analysis. Twenty-five participants took part in a feasibility study and exercised in their homes with the Safe Step program for 4 months. The exercise program was available on computers, smartphones, and tablets, and was fully self-managed.In the deductive analysis, expressions of support were demonstrated for all three basic human psychological needs, namely, autonomy, competence, and relatedness. These expressions were related to 11 of the 21 motivation and behavior change techniques in the classification system. The inductive analysis indicated that autonomy (to be in control) was valued and enabled individual adaptations according to different rationales for realizing exercise goals. However, the experience of autonomy was also two-sided and depended on the participants’ competence in exercise and the use of technology. The clarity of the program and exercise videos was seen as key for support in performance and competent choices. Although augmented techniques for social support were requested, support through relatedness was found within the program.In this study, the Safe Step program supported the establishment of new exercise routines, as well as the three basic human psychological needs, with autonomy and competence being expressed as central in this context. Based on the participants’ experiences, a proposed addition to the classification system used as an analytical matrix has been presented.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02916849; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02916849."

Applying an Ethical Framework to Chatbots for Cognitive Behaviour Therapy \nhttps://doi.org/10.3389/fdgth.2021.689736\n Giovanna Nunes Vilaza \n Darragh McCashin \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has intensified the need for mental health support across the whole spectrum of the population. Where global demand outweighs the supply of mental health services, established interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) have been adapted from traditional face-to-face interaction to technology-assisted formats. One such notable development is the emergence of Artificially Intelligent (AI) conversational agents for psychotherapy. Pre-pandemic, these adaptations had demonstrated some positive results; but they also generated debate due to a number of ethical and societal challenges. This article commences with a critical overview of both positive and negative aspects concerning the role of AI-CBT in its present form. Thereafter, an ethical framework is applied with reference to the themes of (1) beneficence, (2) non-maleficence, (3) autonomy, (4) justice, and (5) explicability. These themes are then discussed in terms of practical recommendations for future developments. Although automated versions of therapeutic support may be of appeal during times of global crises, ethical thinking should be at the core of AI-CBT design, in addition to guiding research, policy, and real-world implementation as the world considers post-COVID-19 society."

Verbal data gathered through an online questionnaire with open questions were analyzed using semidirected content analysis. Most faculty and all students reported negative feelings, which were connected with some faculty members’ focus on delivering content without interaction and with insufficient Internet access. Some students’ autonomy allowed them to overcome the first of these challenges. Teachers with online education training reported better experiences. Thus, universities and the State must provide more training and equipment to close the digital gap and ensure effective emergency remote teaching."

Manufacturers of medical IoB devices promise to provide significant health benefits, improved treatment outcomes and other benefits, but such IoB also carry serious risks to health and life, including the risks of hacking (cyberhacking), malfunctioning, receiving false positive measurements, breaching privacy, deliberate invasion of privacy. In addition, medical IoB products can directly cause physical harm to the human body. As human flesh is intertwined with hardware, software, and algorithms, the IoB will test our social values and ethics. In particular, IoB will challenge notions of human autonomy and self-government as they threaten to undermine the fundamental precondition of human autonomy. Thus, the protection of human autonomy should become the main ethical principle of the use of medical IoB devices."

The Ordinance states that remote teaching activities must be applied to students of all education levels, steps, and modalities. As such, the main objective of this study was to investigate, through a bibliographic research, what are the skills that teachers of high ability/gifted students should have in the context of remote classes. We undertook a qualitative bibliographic research by surveying material readily available for consulting on the internet, such as educational books, periodic publications, and laws pertaining to high ability/gifted students and their learning process. After sorting through this material, we conducted an analysis to discuss data and later compiled suggestions of potential methodologies that could be applied to online classrooms. Our findings emphasize that both teaching knowledge and practice must offer high ability/gifted students optimized challenges, which integrate provocative novelties and motivate the development of their abilities and the dynamicity in activities. Furthermore, they also foster the students’ autonomy, making individual interests deeper, as well as their creative, critical and research abilities. Therefore, active learning methodologies are an asset to the teaching-learning process of students with specific educational needs."

This paper examines the significance of this Act for the electricity sector, specifically investigating to what extent the current European Union Bill addresses the societal and governance challenges posed by the use of AI that affects the tasks of system operators. For this we identify various options for the use of AI by system operators, as well as associated risks. AI has the potential to facilitate grid management, flexibility asset management and electricity market activities. Associated risks include lack of transparency, decline of human autonomy, cybersecurity, market dominance, and price manipulation on the electricity market. We determine to what extent the current bill pays attention to these identified risks and how the European Union intends to govern these risks. The proposed AI Act addresses well the issue of transparency and clarifying responsibilities, but pays too little attention to risks related to human autonomy, cybersecurity, market dominance and price manipulation. We make some governance suggestions to address those gaps."

Excessive digital gaming may affect the mental health status. Aim: To measure the prevalence of digital gaming and to assess the relationship between digital gaming and psychological well-being among college going adolescents. Materials and Methods: A college based cross-sectional study was conducted among 415 adolescents (≤19 years of age) studying in arts, engineering and medical colleges located in Puducherry. The study participants were recruited using stratified multistage sampling technique. After obtaining written informed consent, study participants were interviewed using a structured questionnaire consisting of variables such as socio-demography, usage and pattern of digital gaming. Gaming Addiction Scale was used to assess the level of addiction to digital gaming. Psychological well-being score was assessed using 42 items Ryff’s scale with six domains such as autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relations with others, purpose in life and self-acceptance. Data was analysed in IBM SPSS Statistics for windows, Version 21.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, New York). Chi-square test and one-way ANOVA tests were used to measure the p-value, p<0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: Out of 415 study participants, 83.1% were current or past players of digital games. Females (93%) ever played more than males (74%) (p<0.001). The proportion of current/past gamers was lowest in the participants aged 17 years (49.1%) (p<0.001). All engineering and arts students (100%) played the digital games either currently or in past, however it was only 48.9% among medical students (p<0.001). Majority (53.6%) played in both online and offline mode. About three-fourth (76.2%) of the study participants were playing digital games at their homes. The proportion of daily playing digital gamers was higher in females (28.6%) than males (23.4%) but statistically not significant (p=0.215). A 29% of the study participants felt bad when they were unable to play games. The prevalence of addictive and problematic users among those who were playing digital games was 4.3% and 33.6%, respectively. The mean score of self-acceptance dimension of psychological well-being was lowest among current users than past and never users with statistical significance (p=0.046). However, the dimension of personal growth was higher among current and never users than past users (p<0.001). Conclusion: Most of the college going adolescents had ever played digital games. There was no significant relationship between psychological well-being and digital gaming except for personal growth and self-acceptance dimensions."

    "text": "Doc 1446 :  Caring for care: Online feedback in the context of public healthcare services \nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114280\n Fadhila Mazanderani \n Susan Kirkpatrick \n Sue Ziebland \n Louise Locock \n John Powell \nPeople increasingly provide feedback about healthcare services online. These practices have been lauded for enhancing patient power, choice and control, encouraging greater transparency and accountability, and contributing to healthcare service improvement. Online feedback has also been critiqued for being unrepresentative, spreading inaccurate information, undermining care relations, and jeopardising professional autonomy. Through a thematic analysis of 37 qualitative interviews, this paper explores the relationship between online feedback and care improvement as articulated by healthcare service users (patients and family members) who provided feedback across different online platforms and social media in the UK. Online feedback was framed by interviewees as, ideally, a public and, in many cases, anonymous ‘conversation’ between service users and healthcare providers. These ‘conversations’ were thought of not merely as having the potential to bring about tangible improvements to healthcare, but as in themselves constituting an improvement in care. Vital to this was the premise that providing feedback was an enactment of care - care for other patients, certainly, but also care for healthcare as such and even for healthcare professionals. Ultimately, feedback was understood as an enactment of care for the National Health Service (NHS), as symbolically encompassing all of the above. Putting these findings in dialogue with STS scholarship on care, we argue that, in this context, the provision of online feedback can be understood as a form of care that is, simultaneously, both directed at healthcare (in the round, including patients, professionals, services, organisations, and, of course, health itself) and part of healthcare. We conceptualise this as ‘caring for care’. This conceptualization moves beyond dominant framings of online feedback in terms of ‘choice’ and ‘voice’. It embeds online feedback within pre-existing healthcare systems, relations and moral commitments, foregrounds the mutuality of care relations, and draws attention to the affective labour of feedback practices."

The study was implemented during the first semester of 2016, and its goal was to develop speaking skills through workshops organized on a web page. Data was collected through field notes, students’ artifacts, recordings, and questionnaires. The results showed that the use of ICTs caught the students’ attention, encouraged them to speak English, and increased their vocabulary. Being able to speak and understand more vocabulary could help students use the language in real life situations, as well as reinforce their learning autonomy."

    "text": "Doc 1448 :  A Framework for ICT Implementation in School Education in India \nhttps://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3875251\n Gurumurthy Kasinathan \nIt is widely accepted that digital technologies (popularly known as Information and Communication Technologies or ICT) have the potential to strengthen and reform school education. However, in the absence of clear framework for program design, the impact on learning processes and outcomes from numerous attempts by different governments and other actors has not lived up to this potential. This note provides a holistic framework for such a design, covering infrastructure, teacher education, curriculum and content and education administration, aiming to support the creation of an ecosystem of ICT integration. The note assumes certain principles- firstly ICT program should aim to support the achievement of educational aims. A deep understanding of aims, philosophies, contexts, needs and priorities of education in India, is indispensable for meaningful and effective program design.\nSecondly, ICT implementation must support the achievement of education policy. The thrust of these policies has been to support constructivist classroom pedagogies, make learning connected to local contexts and responsive to learner needs, make the school culture democratic and participatory, support decentralized school system administration by strengthening school autonomy, teacher agency and connecting the school to the local community, going beyond a narrow focus on learning outcomes. The ‘public’ nature of education aligns strongly with free and open ICT architectures. It is recommended by the National ICT policy that the ICT implementation in school education use free and open technologies, including FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) and OER (Open Educational Resources). The design of ICT programs must consciously aim for sustainability, where the schools and other institutions can continue the integration of ICT beyond the initial investment period. Developing in-house capacities of teachers and teacher educators to appropriate free and open ICTs for their work, can sustain the use of ICT, freed from vendor lock-ins. Using ICT to build peer networks of teachers can support continuing professional development and sustain ICT implementation in the school."

In doing so, Oxford Placement Test was administered among100 EFL learners studying at Rooyesh language institute in Kelishad, Isfahan, Iran; and based on the results, 80 EFL learners were selected. Then, the autonomy test was conducted to divide them into autonomous and dependent groups. In the next step, they were divided into two equal experimental and control groups (N=40) that each group was subdivided to an autonomous and a dependent group (i.e., 20 autonomous and 20 dependent participants in each CG and EG). Their age ranged between 14 and 18 years old. Gender of participants was not considered as a variable in the study. Next, a metaphorical expression pretest was administered to all groups of the study and then the experimental group was given the metaphorical expressions via Instagram application, whereas the control group only followed conventional treatment. At the end, the posttest of L2 metaphorical expression was administered to both groups of the study and finally the data were analyzed. Analyzing the data through the one-way repeated measures ANOVA and ANCOVA revealed that utilizing Instagram application had a positively significant effect on autonomous/dependent Iranian intermediate EFL learners’ pictorial metaphors learning. Furthermore, both autonomous and dependent students had a positive attitude toward using Instagram Application."

This paper examines the factors that influenced local governments’ e-disclosure during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. To accomplish this objective, we systematically tracked every post published by the official Facebook page of 304 Portuguese municipalities between March 2 and July 5, 2020. The findings show that financial autonomy is the main predictor of e-disclosure, factors varied on the different phases of the pandemic’s first wave, and sociodemographic factors became more prevalent as explanatory factors when the crisis worsened. Our study may help increase the level of preparedness during possible future crises. In particular, establishing communication strategies for prolonged public health crises, making financial resources available for the accomplishment of such strategies, and reducing the digital divide can contribute to more effective disclosure. Future research should explore the dynamics of disclosure during public health crises. This study also highlights the need to incorporate time in research that focuses on the determinants of e-disclosure that could also be tested in normal times."

The main purpose of this research was to explore the effects of ICT engagement factors on science performance across Singapore and Turkey conditional to the sufficient degree of measurement invariance of ICT engagement scale. The multi-group confirmatory factor analysis results demonstrated strong factorial invariance of ICT engagement scale across Singapore and Turkey, so we were able to use ICT engagement scale to meaningful and valid comparisons between these countries. After obtaining measurement invariance, a multi-group structural equation modeling was used for the comparison of the effects of ICT engagement factors on student’s performance of science between these two countries. While interest in ICT, perceived ICT competence and perceived autonomy in using ICT have significant positive direct effect on science performance in both countries, the direct effect of social relatedness in using ICT on science performance is negative in both Singapore and Turkey. Also, when compared with Singapore, the effects of all ICT engagement constructs on student’s performance are higher in Turkey.

This new form of learning inverts the traditional conception of the classroom: instruction is transferred from the classroom to out-of-class (online) tasks such as pre-recorded lectures on the Internet, while class time is devoted to activities that put the knowledge into practice. These classrooms have been touted as learner-based and student-centered models of education. Yet there is still little evidence supporting the effectiveness of the flipped classroom at higher levels of education, especially in the humanities. Taking American studies as an example, I will examine some of the arguments in favor of this model, but also and most importantly some of the challenges facing the application of this new educational model in the humanities. In general, the main concern is that flipped classrooms may undermine student-teacher dialogue, viewing teachers as “moderators” who design learning environments geared to the students. At the same time, home-learning environments may compromise learner autonomy and limit learners’ opportunities for self-organized work and interaction with peers outside class. Ultimately, a critique of the concept of flipped classrooms is also a critique of the egalitarian aspirations of digital pedagogy in general."

We explore the extent to which internet undertakings should be subject to state regulation, in light of Canada’s ongoing debates and legislative reform. We bring a cross-disciplinary perspective (from the subject fields of law; communications studies, in particular McLuhan’s now classic probes; international relations; and technology studies) to enable both policy and language analysis. We apply the concept of sovereignty to states (national cultural and digital sovereignty), media platforms (transnational sovereignty), and citizens (autonomy and personal data sovereignty) to examine the competing dynamics and interests that need to be considered and mediated. While there is growing awareness of the tensions between state and transnational media platform powers, the relationship between media content regulation and the collection of viewers’ personal data is relatively less explored. We analyse how future media content regulation needs to fully account for personal data extraction practices by transnational platforms and other media content undertakings. We posit national cultural sovereignty—a constant unfinished process and framework connecting the local to the global—as the enduring force and justification of media content regulation in Canada. The exercise of state sovereignty may be applied not so much to secure strict territorial borders and centralized power over citizens but to act as a mediating power to promote and protect citizens’ individual and collective interests, locally and globally."

In this scenario, the technological support offered by public institutions has the potential to be an accessible source for the digital literacy of older people. This study, using the model of digital inequality, had the aim of analysing the ability of these institutional supports to determine and predict the digital inclusion of older people. The sample was retired adults (over 54 years) residing in Spain who are users of technological support services in four organisational contexts: nursing homes, senior community centres, University Programs for Seniors and adult education programmes. Through binary logistic regression analysis, we found that the ability of the availability of literacy support to determine and predict access, autonomy, skills and use of the internet for social connectivity depends on the social and organisational context of the technology support service. These findings support empirically the situated nature of technological support for the digital inclusion of older people and provide a useful comparative vision for the design of accessible support services adapted to the needs of its users."

Liu \n Neil Chueh-An Lee \nOrganizations must adapt to the trend of digitalization. Nowadays, social media engagement editors play an increasingly crucial role for organizational growth and prosperity in the digital age. Engagement editors are usually tasked to perform the functions of marketing, content production, and data analysis. They have to manage online communities on behalf of the organization, and encounter online audiences’ frequent toxic and aggressive behaviors. Engagement editors thus are prone to emotional stress. Substantial literature has examined the influence of leadership style on employee performance. However, passive leadership is rarely studied. This research investigates (1) whether passive leadership would negatively affect engagement editors’ performance (i.e., online interaction with audiences); and (2) how the negativity would be ameliorated by certain organizational policies (i.e., job autonomy) and their individual attributes (i.e., employee resilience) from the conservation of resource perspective. We surveyed 122 engagement editors and used the smartPLS 3.2.9 to analyze the data. This research provides important theoretical and practical implications."

The theoretical foundations of gifted adolescents’ addiction prevention from the virtual environment are presented. Various currents of researchers’ views on the adolescents’ giftedness factor and the associated addiction risks on the virtual environment are shown. Conclusions about the urgent need to prevent this phenomenon are drawn. The risk factors for the addiction emergence of gifted adolescents on the virtual environment have been identified. The model of addiction prevention on the virtual environment is described. Teenage age – transitional age which is characterized by all systems of an organism formation. During this period perhaps unstable condition of the teenager’s nervous system strengthened by daily stressor which accumulatingly can generate a stress. All these factors can provoke an Internet-dependent behavior emergence among the presented and not gifted teenagers therefore prospect of further researches is gifted teenagers’ dependence on the virtual environment correction program creation. On the given results basis of the world researches on dependence on the virtual environment, namely Internet dependence, we had a vision of gifted teenagers’ dependence process which we presented in the form of dependence prevention theoretical model which we also use further in practice. According to our model of gifted teenagers’ dependence prevention on the virtual environment, personal labour is the component bringing out of dependence. The steady condition of a teenager’s nervous system is a basis of dependence prevention. The autonomy of the teenager’s identity is an integrated basis of dependence prevention on the virtual environment. Facing considered by us researches’ results about increase in destructive use of the Internet by teenagers, further work on prevention and correction of gifted teenagers’ dependence on the virtual environment seems necessary to us"

Smart homes can offer home assistance services to improve the quality of life, autonomy and health of their residents, especially for the elderly and dependent. To provide such services, a smart home must be able to understand the daily activities of its residents. Techniques for recognizing human activity in smart homes are advancing daily. But new challenges are emerging every day. In this paper, we present recent algorithms, works, challenges and taxonomy of the field of human activity recognition in a smart home through ambient sensors. Moreover, since activity recognition in smart homes is a young field, we raise specific problems, missing and needed contributions. But also propose directions, research opportunities and solutions to accelerate advances in this field."

Rice \n Gavin Lawrence Kirkwood \nAbstract Concertive control (CC) theory has primarily been applied to traditional offline, work-based, closed membership teams. New organizational forms such as online communities have opened up additional sites in which CC processes may operate. This article makes several contributions to CC theory and research. First, it increases the applicability of CC theory by extending it from offline to online, work to non-work, and closed to open membership contexts. Second, it increases our understanding of CC processes by elaborating on three mechanisms of CC (group autonomy, group identification, and generative discipline) and how they operate differently in online work/non-work and closed/open contexts. Third, it develops propositions about how these mechanisms interact with three prominent media affordances (visibility, persistence and editability) within those contexts. Extending CC theory to online communities helps to explain individuals’ responses to normative group pressures online, which is highly relevant in our increasingly culturally and politically polarized society."

Sensors can reduce respondent burden by eliminating survey questions and improve measurement accuracy by replacing/augmenting self-reports. However, if respondents who are not willing to collect sensor data differ on critical attributes from those who are, the results can be biased. Research on the mechanisms of willingness to collect sensor data mostly comes from (nonprobability) online panels and is hypothetical (i.e., asks participants about the likelihood of participation in a sensor-based study). In a cross-sectional general population randomized experiment, we investigate how features of the request and respondent characteristics influence willingness to share (WTS) and actually sharing smartphone-sensor data. We manipulate the request to either mention or not mention (1) how participation will benefit the participant, (2) participants’ autonomy over data collection, and (3) that data will be kept confidential. We assess nonparticipation bias using the administrative records. WTS and actually sharing varies by sensor task, participants’ autonomy over data sharing, their smartphone skills, level of privacy concerns, and attitudes toward surveys. Fewer people agree to share photos and a video than geolocation, but all who agreed to share photos or a video actually did. Some nonresponse and nonparticipation biases are substantial and make each other worse, but others jointly reduce the overall bias. Our findings suggest that sensor-data-sharing decisions depend on sample members’ situation when asked to share and the nature of the sensor task rather than the sensor type."

On the basis of the analysis of the domestic migrant works’ concerns and their emotion analysis, we crawl data on Weibo about migrant works’ topics as the basic corpus of migrant works’ concerns, and then uses a combination of TF-IDF and Word2Vec methods to construct a recognition model of migrant workers’ concerns. We found that wages, children’s education, medical care and returning home are the main concerns of migrant workers. Meanwhile, further emotion analysis of the migrant works’ concerns of using a deep learning model fused with Bi-LSTM and CNN was conducted. The results show that the proportion of negative emotion such as worries, complaints and impetuosity was significantly higher than that of other positive and neutral emotion like encourage and comfort. And the time when the negative emotion are concentrated is significantly related to the social events that occur in the corresponding time period. On the one hand, it shows that the concerns and emotion of migrant workers can be effectively observed and predicted through web text data. On the other hand, it also shows that the core well-being issues of migrant workers in the process of urban integration have not been effectively solved, and the government and relevant departments need to take targeted measures and give priority attention."

It is critical to achieve efficient and dynamic spectrum management in the sixth-generation wireless communication networks (6G) era. To tackle the challenges of managing a large-scale IoT network with heterogeneous devices, we propose a directed acyclic graph (DAG) blockchain enhanced user-autonomy spectrum sharing model. As the proposed consensus rule is closely related to system utility, the swarm intelligence of users gradually reaches the point of convergence in the process of blockchain consensus. We analyse the effect of the tip selection method of DAG blockchain on spectrum allocation utility. A dynamic tip selection method is proposed to enhance the global utility, which is related to the spectrum supply-demand. In addition, the ring signature technique is utilized to realize privacy protection during the sharing process. Simulation indicates that the proposed tip selection method achieves a 10% enhancement in terms of the global utility. Furthermore, significant reductions in administrative expense and reliability improvement are demonstrated by the simulation results. The stability of the tip number in the proposed model has been proved theoretically, which is also validated by simulation experiments."

Using classroom research design, this study aimed to investigate the perspectives of Engineering students of smartphone use in an academic writing course. The data were collected from students enrolled in a writing course in a top-ranked Science and Technology university in Thailand. Fifty students voluntarily submitted reflections towards the end of the semester. The study was qualitative, in which inductive coding was used. The findings elicited specific situations of smartphone use in an academic writing course, for example, knowing and looking at the meaning of words, knowing the word form, finding information, taking notes, brainstorming with friends, using translation, and others. Two roles of smartphone use were coded. The first role is facilitative, which has the following functions: resource-based, cognitive-based, memory-based, output-based, collaborative-based, entertainment-based, and communicative-based. Another is the debilitative role indicating two functions, such as sources of cognitive distraction and undesirable behaviors. Interestingly, self-regulation of smartphone use in class was coded. Implications on how smartphones can be used in teaching writing were also discussed."

This article presents an initial step towards filling this research gap. My research question in this article regards how employees of companies using the ESM Workplace from Facebook feel that the implementation of this particular platform relates to their potential struggles for digital privacy and work–life segmentation. Methodologically, I explore this through a qualitative interview study of 21 Danish knowledge workers in different organisations using the ESM. The central analytical proposal of the article is that the interviewees express a “digital resignation” towards the implementation of the ESM. In contrast to previous discussions, this resignation cannot only be thought of as “corporately cultivated” by third parties, but must also be considered as “organisationally cultivated” by the organisations people work for. The study suggests that datafication-oriented media studies should consider organisational contexts."

Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines which are as intelligent as human beings. AI mainly focus on some questions like knowledge required while thinking, the way knowledge can be presented and the way knowledge can be used in other field’s viz. Robotics. Scope of AI is much wider than our thinking. It is not limited to only one or two areas rather in coming future everything will be directly or indirectly linked to AI. Much research has been done on artificial intelligence which has shown that by the end of 2020 many works which was not possible by human beings will be efficiently and accurately can be carried out by the help of robots. Robotics is a branch of engineering that deals with formation, designing, manufacturing, operation of robots. Artificial intelligence is being applied to many areas which are capable to solve many problems like in robotics, e-commerce, domestic chores, medical treatment, gaming, mathematics, military planning etc. The main idea behind the merging of artificial intelligence and robotics is to optimize the level of autonomy through learning. In the coming future we can surely overcome the disadvantages of robots like misuse of it with the help of facial recognition. Or we can use AI in other fields like in cyber security to prevent the systems from being hacked. The applications of AI and how we can implement other applications in coming time are discussed adding to it how we can overcome the disadvantages of using robots in regular life are also discussed."

Automated financial services remedy present biased financial behaviour by nudging users towards investing. Although these services increase investments, they deprive users of the experience of making prudent decisions that would satisfy their need for autonomy. Assuming that freedom of choice facilitates autonomy, we hypothesized that the addition of an element of choice to an automated micro-investment service would increase the amounts invested. To test this idea, we randomised 825 volunteer users of a micro-investments service at an Estonian bank to receive different versions of weekly emails offering a choice to double, quadruple, or keep the money they had accrued for investment through the service. We found that the treatment increased the average investment per participant by 20 to 36%. The effectiveness of the treatments was independent of a number of financial, socio-economic, or personality characteristics other than income. We conclude that the addition of elements of choice to automated investment services has a significant potential to increase investments and improve financial well-being."

However, for Ukrainian universities, this situation can be seen as an opportunity to achieve financial autonomy. This study is devoted to the consideration of a possible tool for the financial autonomy of Ukrainian classical universities, most of which are state-funded. The paper considers the methodology of a possible tool for the accumulation of external financing – the endowment fund. The case analysis and analytical consideration of world practice are applied. As a result, a model for financing the university in its transition to the innovation and entrepreneurship model is proposed as the chain “endowment fund – development of start-ups”. This example can become the basis of the road map for other national HEIs, as well as the practice of wider use in the field of higher education. However, despite most of the national classical universities have declared a course to an innovative development, which further raised the necessity of external funding, top management and general economic situation require more attention. As this transition to a new model of the university is taking place along with the financial stabilization and under economic and social upheavals, the formation of a new culture of online communication is necessary. Thus, the proposed model is the practical guideline of possible decisions but mostly the start-point for further discussion and research. AcknowledgmentThis paper is done in the framework of the grant project “Financial stabilization of classical universities in the context of the global consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic” funded by the National Research Foundation of Ukraine “Science for Human Security and Society” (2020-2021)."

    "text": "Doc 1468 :  TOWARDS AN INFRASTRUCTURE-BASED SOCIOLOGY OF DIGITAL SOVEREIGNTY PRACTICES: THE ‘PILOT CASE’ OF RUSSIA \nhttps://doi.org/10.5210/spir.v2021i0.11993\n Francesca Musiani \n“Digital sovereignty” is the idea that states should “reaffirm” their authority over the Internet and protect their citizens, institutions, and businesses from the multiple challenges to their nation’s self-determination in the digital sphere. According to this principle, sovereignty depends on more than supranational alliances or international legal instruments, military might or trade: it depends on locally-owned, controlled and operated innovation ecosystems, able to increase states’ technical and economic independence and autonomy. Presently, digital sovereignty is understood primarily as a legal concept and a set of political discourses. As a consequence, it is predominantly analysed by political science, international relations and international law. However, the study of digital sovereignty as a set of infrastructures and socio-material practices has been largely neglected. In this proposal, I argue that the concept of (digital) sovereignty should also be studied via the infrastructure-embedded “situated practices” of various political and economic projects which aim to establish autonomous digital infrastructures in a hyperconnected world. Although this contribution is also a call for a wider and comparative research programme, I will focus here on the “pilot case” of Russia, which is the subject of an ongoing research project. Ultimately, the analysis of infrastructure-embedded digital sovereignty practices in Russia shows how the Russian discourse on Internet sovereignty as a centralized and top-down apparatus paradoxically open up technical and legal opportunities for mundane resistances and the existence of “parallel” Runets, where particular instantiations of informational freedom are still possible."

In this context, surveillance is widely portrayed as a means to maintain the independence of those being monitored. This paper examines the promise of smart care through analysis of documentation from policy, from research and development settings and from marketing materials aimed at carers, people living with dementia and social care agencies in the UK. For informal carers, the monitoring carried out by smart care systems is predominantly framed as reassurance for the carer, while for the person living with dementia a reassurance is offered that there will be help at times of need. For healthcare professionals, lack of knowledge is positioned as a limiting factor on providing optimal care and hence the monitoring offered by smart care becomes an ethical responsibility in the search for improved care as well as a means to increased efficiency. While smart care aims to promote independence, this form of surveillance and the AI-generated predictions that are built upon it can offer imperatives to action that may act against autonomy. To evaluate ethical implications more fully we need to move beyond the promotional discourse to find out more about how people live with such systems and how these systems become a part of the relations of expertise and responsibility that pervade care."

In this regard, the emergence of a ‘new’ right to be forgotten (RTBF) in the EU, which protects the ‘personal data’ of individuals, has received critical acclaim. While tracing the origins, nature and scope of the RTBF in EU, this article shall attempt to best jurisprudentially locate RTBF as both an ‘independent right’ and a facet derived from values like ‘privacy’, ‘autonomy’ and ‘dignity’. Subsequently, the problem of ‘theoretical indeterminacy’ arising from co-existence of RTBF and right to ‘privacy’ shall be addressed. Moving forward, the practical limitations of RTBF and its ‘balancing’ with competing rights/interests shall be delineated. Finally, a comparative analysis of the RTBF in the supra-national EU with the nascent development of RTBF and right to ‘informational privacy’ in India shall be undertaken."

For Native Americans this means ideating while navigating colonial inequality. Through an investigation of sociotechnical interdependencies across a broadband network cooperative, tribes, and university labs, an HCI team reflects on how relational stability sustains fragile Internet ecologies stretched to capacity by the needs of users deeply affected by COVID-19 in New Mexico and Arizona. Through an autoethnography of community-centered digital solutions for Navajo Nation, a member of the Nation considers how the role of K’é informs a system of infrastructural care in a nation struggling with high rates of infection and systemic lack of adequate infrastructure. Through an advocacy-oriented analysis of social media content, a Diné and Lakota social media scholar discerns the relationship between community enforcement of social distancing, the loss of interpersonal interaction, mutual aid, and the impact of public health memes for the Navajo Nation. Through radical librarianship practices, a Tohono O’odham librarian and artist counteracts the values of ‘information neutrality’ shaping whiteness-centering American librarianship by generating a community-curated solution to actionable information about COVID-19 for Indigenous communities. This panel models decolonial liberation rooted in responsiveness across mediated layers of Indigenous belonging. The authors express Indigenous interpretations of collective autonomy vis-a-vis strategic Internet assemblages, and particularly, how an Indigenous ethics of care intersects with the dream of an Internet for social good."

The liberalization of the media market that started in 2000, led to proliferation of media outlets and galloping commercialization of media ownership and content. The next big change came with digitalization that fundamentally altered media habits of Croatian audiences. Television was preceded by online media as the main source of news while the press registers constant decline in readership, trust and advertising revenues. Radio remains the most trusted medium, as opposed to social media that are the least trusted source of information. Nevertheless, the level of trust in social networks in Croatia is considerably higher than the EU average.The data on media freedom and journalistic autonomy indicate that Croatia has made significant progress in this respect in the past thirty years. Although problems related to freedom, autonomy and political pressure persist, the biggest threat to journalism nowadays seems to come from within the profession. Commercialization, coupled with digitalization and merciless struggle for survival, eventually led news media to succumb to tabloid-style journalism and to radically downplay their professional standards. Although the role of the media as a social corrective remains undisputed, such media practices seem to cultivate ‘media fatigue’ and foster distrust in political institutions. In such an ethically challenging environment, the newsrooms and professional organizations remain for the most part silent about eroding professional standards."

How social media interests and brand management practices define the rules of engagement \nhttps://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/EJM-09-2019-0692/full/html\n Georgia-Zozeta Miliopoulou \nThis paper aims to examine brand-generated communities from the community managers’ point of view and investigate how social media influences managerial perceptions, attitudes and practises around brand communities.,The literature review examines the most prominent constructs describing consumer groupings around brands. It then focuses on how the term “brand community” has evolved throughout the years and transformed in the social media environment. Research involving one survey and one focus group among agency-employed brand community managers was conducted to explore and interpret their views and their work.,Brand community managers aim to increase platform metrics. They encourage interaction between each user and the brand, but not between users. While they execute pre-planned content calendars handling comments, they do not have the experience and autonomy to foster a communal environment. Finally, managers rely on extrinsic incentives, and even antagonise users, regarding control over the community.,The sample covers the majority of agency-employed brand community managers in one country: Greece. The findings call for a re-examination of the construct of brand community, as well as for a new assessment of groupings consumers form around brands in social media.,For actual brand communities to emerge in social media, community managers should have more training, experience and initiative to tailor content and metrics, use intrinsic incentives and propose engaging activities. The quest for platform-imposed measurements inhibits this opportunity, and so do centralised processes that define global brand management.,The managerial aspect of brand-generated communities is understudied, especially when management is outsourced. This paper provides insight on how platform priorities and managerial practises dilute expectations that consumer-generated communities have created."

This paper treats Rivendell as an opening onto the politics at play when the liberal ethos propelling free and open source software (Coleman, 2013) meets the autonomy-prizing traditions of independent broadcasting within an automation system. Complicating this already tense juncture, Rivendell has drawn users and code contributors from drastically opposed political groups within American broadcastings—right-wing Christian talk radio networks and progressive community stations—and has sustained a difficult terrain of working compromise that the activist push for low-power FM broadcasting inaugurated (Dunbar-Hester, 2014). In this paper, analysis of Rivendell’s open source code base sheds light on its development and helps connect it to longer histories of media automation and its attendant social frictions. Interviews with lead Rivendell developers complete the picture of the project’s trajectory, of its relation to the religious right context where the project began, and of the negotiations that have played out among its developers and its community of users in terrestrial and internet radio. The ongoing compromises and tensions threaded through Rivendell can offer insight into an issue that becomes larger and more pressing as media become increasingly complex and networked: how artists, activists, and media technologists who prioritize independence have reckoned with their reliance on socio-technical infrastructures whose connections may strike them as far less than savory."

Obligations, permissions and prohibitions are distinct from a system’s mission, and are a necessary part of specifying advanced, adaptive AI-equipped systems. They need a dedicated deontic logic of obligations to formalize them. Most existing deontic logics lack corresponding algorithms and system models that permit automatic verification. We demonstrate how a particular deontic logic, Dominance Act Utilitarianism (DAU), is a suitable starting point for formalizing the obligations of autonomous systems like self-driving cars. We demonstrate its usefulness by formalizing a subset of Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) in DAU; RSS is an industrial proposal for how self-driving cars should and should not behave in traffic. We show that certain logical consequences of RSS are undesirable, indicating a need to further refine the proposal. We also demonstrate how obligations can change over time, which is necessary for long-term autonomy. We then demonstrate a model-checking algorithm for DAU formulas on weighted transition systems, and illustrate it by model-checking obligations of a self-driving car controller from the literature."

Motivation, the chance to work independently and/ or collaboratively, access to the internet and library, and challenging tasks promote learner autonomy. This study explores English language teachers’ perceptions and practices on learner autonomy and finds the difference in the perceptions and practices by their sex, level, qualification, and type of school they teach. One hundred thirty-three (133) teachers teaching at Tulsipur Sub-metropolitan Dang, Nepal, were selected using the fishbowl technique. Data drawn with the questionnaire’s help were analysed via univariate (frequency, percentage, and median) and bivariate (t-test and Cohen’s d) analysis. From the analyses, it was found that English language teachers teaching at different levels are aware of the what, why, and how of learner autonomy, and they promote learner autonomy by engaging and encouraging students to be involved in the tasks which promote learner autonomy. Perceptions on learner autonomy do not differ by their sex, level, qualification, and type of school they teach. Likewise, practices on learner autonomy also do not differ by the sex and level of the teachers, but their practices differ by the type of school where they teach and their qualification."

A perspective of self-determination theory \nhttps://doi.org/10.1108/imds-06-2020-0322\n Shaobo Wei \n Xiayu Chen \n Chunli Liu \nPurpose The authors develop a conceptual model to examine how three basic psychological needs (i.e. needs for competence, autonomy and relatedness) affect employee social media use (i.e. work- and social-related use). The authors propose that the need for autonomy positively moderates the relationship between need for competence and work-related use, whereas it negatively moderates that between need for relatedness and social-related use. Design/methodology/approach To test the proposed model, 332 internal and 271 external social media users in the workplace were recruited. Findings The results indicate that needs for competence and autonomy and needs for relatedness and autonomy positively affect the work- and social-related use, respectively, of internal and external social media. Need for autonomy positively moderates the relationship between need for competence and work-related use of internal social media, and it negatively moderates that between need for relatedness and the social-related use of internal social media. Need for autonomy has no moderating effect on the relationship between need for competence and work-related use, whereas it negatively moderates the relationship between need for relatedness and the social-related use of external social media. Originality/value First, the authors’ findings offer significant empirical support for the different social media uses, namely work and social related. Second, this study highlights the importance of psychological needs of employees in determining the form of social media use. Third, this study empirically demonstrates the differences in psychological needs and social media use between two different social media contexts."

The proliferation of invocations of ‘ethics’, especially concerning the recent debate on (the regulation of) Artificial Intelligence (AI), can be referred to as the ‘ethification’ phenomenon. This article aims to elucidate the benefits and drawbacks of the ethification of ICT governance, and its effects on the articulations of law, technology and politics in democratic constitutional states. First, the article will provide a mapping to locate where the ethics work is being produced in the EU. Second, the authors will distinguish different types of ethics based on the mapping. Third, the ethification phenomenon will be analyzed through the concepts of boundary and convergence work, where we will both see that it plays the role of ‘normative glue’ between interests of different practices to reach a common goal, but also tracing or obfuscating boundaries to claim autonomy from the law and exclude forms of non-genuine ethics. Fourth, we inquire into the nature of ethics as a practice and the consequences of ethification for the law."

Through the analysis of 32 semi-structured interviews with music industry professionals and experts and observations of their activities on Facebook, the study identifies the decreasing distance between music criticism and music promotion. On the one hand, the music critics once envisioned as ‘autonomous gatekeepers’ (Hirsch, 1972) find it increasingly hard to transfer their musical authority, expertise and perceived independence to the commercially driven social media environment. As a result, some of them have taken up entrepreneurship themselves, converged their various identities by mixing their critical/evaluative practices as critics and business-oriented practices as entrepreneurs. On the other hand, some niche music entrepreneurs are stepping into the role of cultural authorities by mobilizing and catering to specific taste cultures and genre communities by becoming expert gatekeepers in their own right, despite being compromised by their business interest. In this context, it is no more useful to talk about the ‘mutual dependency’ of the music press and industry PR (Forde, 2001; Negus, 1992). Rather, among the tightly interwoven music scenes like the ones in Estonia, where many players adopt a variety of different and often conflicting roles (especially on Facebook), we should recognize the complete convergence of music promotion and music criticism and the loss of critical distance and autonomy altogether."

The possibility of making heterogeneous devices communicate with each other through the Internet has given rise to a constantly growing scenario, which was unthinkable not long ago. This unstoppable growth takes place thanks to the continuous availability of increasingly sophisticated device features, an ever-increasing bandwidth and reliability of the connections, and the ever-lower consumption of the devices, which grants them long autonomy. This scenario of exponential growth also involves other sectors such as, for example, that of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which offers us increasingly sophisticated approaches that can be synergistically combined with wireless devices and the Internet in order to create powerful applications for everyday life. Precisely for the aforementioned reasons, the community of researchers, year by year, dedicates more time and resources in this direction. It should be observed that this happens in an atypical way concerning the other research fields, and this is because the achieved progress and the developed applications have practical applications in numerous and different domains."

In the 20th century, do-it-yourself (DIY) biology emerged as a type of biohacking involving biotechnology. Current high- healthcare costs promote DIY -biology insulin and EpiPens as ways to challenge norms in healthcare, thus serving as forms of activism. Biohacked insulin is part of the #WeAreNotWaiting movement to support improved treatment of Type 1 diabetes, whereas biohacked EpiPens allow people to make lifesaving autoinjectors at low costs. Social media acts as a catalyst and aids in the spread of insulin and EpiPen biohacking as activism. In 1979, Principles of Biomedical Ethics by Beauchamp and Childress proposed four principles that continue to guide decision-making in clinical medicine: beneficence, nonmaleficence, autonomy, and justice. This paper applies these principles to explore whether the benefits of performing DIY biology outweigh the potential health risks. Examining biohacking with a biomedical ethics frame, as outlined by Beauchamp and Childress, reveals that biohacking acts as a response to current issues but cannot serve as a solution in its current form. However, biohacking can grant patients more power in their relationship with the healthcare system, therefore lessening the dominance of formal institutions. Out of the four principles, autonomy applies most differently when regarding biohacking than traditional medicine. Accordingly, a model of ethics for biohacking, such as of Beauchamp and Childress’ with the autonomy altered to acknowledge the additional implications of biohacking, should be developed in the future."

Or when we talk about big data and algorithms, they mention the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation. In such cases, I often reply that indeed, privacy is important but that I am more interested in other values that are also relevant and potentially at stake, such as justice, autonomy, equality, solidarity or conviviality; and that indeed, regulation is important but that I am more interested in organizing processes of ethical reflection, inquiry and deliberation."

This development promises improvements in prediction, diagnostics and treatment decisions. As one example, in the field of psychiatry, AI systems can already successfully detect markers of mental disorders such as depression. By using data from social media (e.g. Instagram or Twitter), users who are at risk of mental disorders can be identified. This potential of AI-based depression detectors (AIDD) opens chances, such as quick and inexpensive diagnoses, but also leads to ethical challenges especially regarding users’ autonomy. The focus of the presentation is on autonomy-related ethical implications of AI systems using social media data to identify users with a high risk of suffering from depression. First, technical examples and potential usage scenarios of AIDD are introduced. Second, it is demonstrated that the traditional concept of patient autonomy according to Beauchamp and Childress does not fully account for the ethical implications associated with AIDD. Third, an extended concept of “Health-Related Digital Autonomy” (HRDA) is presented. Conceptual aspects and normative criteria of HRDA are discussed. As a result, HRDA covers the elusive area between social media users and patients. ”"

The surveys were conducted in February 2012 and March 2017. The number of innovations is taken as an outcome variable, while explanatory variables related to R&D and ICTs were extracted from related questions by factor analysis. The fixed effect robust model with an instrumental variable is estimated, since the error term may contain heteroscedasticity. R&D autonomy and the cross-term of R&D autonomy and ICTs are significant, indicating that ICTs contribute to innovation via R&D autonomy."

Much of our communication has transitioned from human-human interaction to human-technology or technology-mediated interaction. As technology is handed over control and streamlines choices and decision-making in different contexts, people are increasingly concerned about a potential threat to their autonomy. In this paper, we explore autonomy perception when interacting with AI-based applications in everyday contexts using a design fiction-based survey with 328 participants. We probed if providing users with explanations on “why” an application made certain choices or decisions influenced their perception of autonomy or reactance regarding the interaction with the applications. We also looked at changes in perception when users are aware of AI’s presence in an application. In the social media context, we found that people perceived a greater reactance and lower sense of autonomy perhaps owing to the personal and identity-sensitive nature of the application context. Providing explanations on “why” in the navigation context, contributed to enhancing their autonomy perception, and reducing reactance since it influenced the users’ subsequent actions based on the recommendation. We discuss our findings and the implications it has for the future development of everyday AI applications that respect human autonomy."

Confinement necessarily induced significant changes in daily family routines, particularly for work, education, leisure and social activities. In the more vulnerable pediatric population, several authors have warned of the need to consider the impact of lockdown measures during COVID-19 on the psychological impact and well-being.This is an anonymous online survey with methodology combining quantitative and qualitative analyses. The questions targeted several themes such as life context, emotional experience and the impact on daily habits in children and adolescents, as perceived by parents. Participants are adults and parents of at least one child. They were recruited through social media and email.A total of 439 parents responded to the questionnaire. The families generally stayed in their usual place of residence and managed to adapt well. On average, the children’s level of worry (as estimated by parents) was lower than the level of worry parents attributed to themselves. For the majority, the parents did not observe any change, the psychological state of the children and adolescents was generally stable, but for those who experienced more negative emotions than usual, it was an increase in boredom, irritability and anger. A decrease in the quality of sleep was also observed by a third of the respondents. On the other hand, an increase in autonomy was noted. Regarding the quality of family cohabitation, an important result showed that confinement had improved family relationships for 41% parents but at the expense of usual social ties inducing a feeling of deprivation. Indeed, the participants evoke a lack of “social link” and “social contact with friends”. Lack became synonymous with absence, a feeling of loneliness and separation.Our results confirm European and international data collected in children in countries where strict lockdown measures have been applied. Despite the negative emotions felt in some children, confinement has helped develop new resources in most families. Families seem to have been successful in maintaining a stable and secure routine which has certainly been a protective factor against anxiety. Some reported factors, such as bonding, could be protective factors and constitute good leads in interventions to be offered to children and their families."

Settler-colonialism has resulted in centuries of dispossession, manifesting in the denial of Indigenous citizenship, autonomy and sovereignty. Throughout this article we discuss how Indigenous people are increasingly turning to social media to illuminate how colonialism continues to oppress Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and communities. In doing so, Indigenous people are disrupting what we call the ‘colonial algorithms’ that shape misguided perceptions of Indigenous people and identities. Analysing Indigenous use of social media and centring our discussion around several Indigenous-led online campaigns, we demonstrate how online platforms are bringing an array of social issues to light in ways that privilege Indigenous voices and perspectives, ultimately disrupting and shifting oppressive colonial algorithms."

A review \nhttps://doi.org/10.3145/epi.2021.ene.03\n João Canavilhas \nThe fast and global way which has characterized the presence of mobile phones in society has sparked the interest of several sectors of activity, including journalism. From the early stages of production to distribution, and then through the characteristics of content and consumption patterns, numerous changes have been introduced by these mobile devices in an activity that has been undergoing one of the most uncertain moments in its long history. This uncertainty has stemmed from the decrease in income which was caused by the emergence of new competitors, such as the online press and social networks. This bibliographic review aims at identifying the changes caused by smartphones in the production distribution and consumption of news, analyzing its effect on the epistemology of journalism. We attempt to ascertain if the increasing influence of mobile technologies in the journalistic activity has changed its nature, improving the production of knowledge. Upon closer reading of the bibliography, it can be concluded that the versatility of mobile devices has facilitated a set of new possibilities not only for journalists, namely more autonomy and a reduction in the time spent between the event and the publication, but also for consumers, who can do a mobile and personalized consumption on their screens. Due to its ability to continuously adapt to the rhythm of contemporary society, mobile journalism has become more universal and has been confirmed as a form of knowledge insofar as it responds more effectively to consumers’ expectations, in particular young people’s, who are moving away from journalism and thus prevent the generational renewal of readers, something which is fundamental for the media business model."

Modern digital technologies with the transition to a more communicative approach offer new forms of assessments that were not available to us even ten years ago. Students have the opportunity to record videos while interacting in groups or even working on a monologue or story. Students often practice uploading podcasts and audio files and creating diary and wiki entries.The article deals with the benefits of digital technology during teaching English, which opens new perspectives on the assessment. The research describes the stages of the organization of assessment in the classroom, emphasizes the importance of feedback on testing, examines some factors that affect the teaching of English in terms of its assessment, gives an overview of the benefits of using washback effect and lists the problems associated with the use of information and communication technologies. The author explores the potential of using formative and summative assessments as well as the feedback to improve students’ academic achievement and progress. Digital technology and assessment help us to achieve some of our goals: improved motivation, autonomy or closer cooperation between students, and so on. In addition, feedback can even be provided by students themselves, which contributes to the formation of self-assessment. Consequently, it becomes obvious what should be changed in the course on the basis of the assessment of students’ progress during the learning cycle.There is a lack of professionalism in the use of some information and communication technologies, which negatively affects the effectiveness of assessment systems of English.\n Keywords: formative assessments, summative assessments, information and communication technologies, digital technologies, feedback, self-assessment, motivation, self-reflection, English."

Cainigcoy \nIndividuals with high self-concept will likely have high life satisfaction, they easily get adjusted to life, and they communicate their feeling more appropriately. However, it was not certain whether self-concept would decline or improve as individuals age, or whether self-concept would vary between genders and ethnic groups. To prove, a study was carried out to compare the self-concept of college students in an Asian context. The inquiry utilized the cross-sectional design in finding out significant differences in the self-concept of participants in terms of age, gender, and ethnicity. A 22-item questionnaire was adapted and administered to 222 Bachelor of Public Administration and Bachelor of Science in Business Administration students from the satellite campus of Bukidnon State University in the Philippines. Initially, a sample was randomly drawn from the population. During the actual data collection, the researchers had difficulty getting the responses from the randomly selected individuals due to internet connection and it was done amidst a pandemic. Instead, it took all responses from those who were available, have access to the internet, and could accomplish the google forms. The data were analyzed using Mean, Standard Deviation, T-test for independent sample, ANOVA and Post Hoc test. The results revealed that college students at the locale have a high level of self-concept in self-fulfilment, emotional adjustment, and honesty. Yet, they only had a moderate level of self-concept in autonomy. Further, there were significant differences in college students’ autonomy and honesty in terms of age and gender. Furthermore, there were significant differences in their emotional adjustment and self-fulfilment as to their ethnicity. The results have implications for instruction, administration, guidance services, and future research."

But as the approach says to keep work and family domains separate, modern work culture and work demands goes in reverse direction. The remaining credit to overlapping of work and non-work activities goes to technology and gadgets like smartphone, tablet, laptop etc. It is obvious that it is not possible to keep these domains isolated to each other and with the limited time and energy obligations of both sides cannot be fulfilled by keeping them separate. It is better to integrate both work and non-work activities so that one can manage his or her time and energy to do all activities in same time. To integrate the different domains, autonomy is required for individuals to choose time, location and quantity of work. Selecting a write flexible work arrangement, will integrate work and life and give a balance between them."

Many factors, dependent on both the woman and her partner, can influence self-dependence, and subsequent decision-making, exerting a protective or triggering effect on its development. Therefore, the primary objective of the study was to assess autonomy in a sample of Lebanese women. The secondary objective was to evaluate the association between socioeconomic status, psychological factors, and autonomy.A web based cross-sectional online study was conducted between June 8 and August 1, 2020. The questionnaire developed on Google Forms was distributed through social media and WhatsApp groups, using the snowball technique. The Women’s Autonomy Index (WAI) was created using three items adapted from a previous study. In addition, the Composite Abuse Scale Revised-Short Form (CASR-SF) was used to assess three domains of abuse: physical, sexual, and psychological. The Perceived stress scale short version to measure stress perception, the Lebanese Anxiety Scale to measure anxiety and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to assess depression. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 25 was used for data analysis. Linear regressions were performed, taking the Women’s Autonomy Index as the dependent variable.The sample consisted of 369 Lebanese women. University education level (beta = 1.263), alcohol consumption (beta = 0.586), intermediate income level (beta = 0.702), high income (beta = 0.911), employment (beta = 0.559), and older age (beta = 0.033) were significantly associated with higher WAI. Living in South Lebanon (beta = - 0.668) and being Druze (beta = - 323) were associated with lower WAI. Significantly higher mean scores of anxiety and perceived stress were found among women with low autonomy.In Lebanon, the autonomy of women depends on several personal and partner-related characteristics (education, socioeconomic status, age), in addition to the cultural (geographic and religious) environment. Furthermore, low autonomy is associated with higher perceived stress and anxiety and probable depression and domestic abuse."

A qualitative and descriptive study was carried out, with data collected through 4 focus groups with the participation of 80 students from an on-site undergraduate program in Accounting Sciences. The results indicate that the students perceive the structural factors (flexibility in the deadlines for delivery of activities), personal and collective factors (autonomy in the learning process) and didactic-pedagogical factors (use of active methodologies by the professor) as facilitating aspects of the remote education. As for the aspects that hinder learning, we highlight external factors (lack of internet access), individual factors (not maintaining a study routine and increased stress levels) and traditional remote education (monotonous videoconference classes). Finally, an optimistic vision for future trends is observed, with changes in the human aspects (change of paradigm of the student’s role), institutional aspects (greater use of technology) and formative aspects (use of active methodologies). It is concluded that the use of active methodologies in the didactic and pedagogical aspect raises the participation of the number of students in remote classes and improves the quality of learning. This study can contribute to educational institutions that adopt emergency remote education for continuity of academic activities in periods of crisis, as well as to professors who plan their activities. It emphasizes the role of the professor and the importance of active methodologies in the development of knowledge."

Despite the vast majority of work in this area, few studies in nursing have investigated the correlation between motivation and mLearning for continuing practice development (CPD). Motivation is an essential theoretical concept used to explain human motive that is not new in nursing. Understanding the notion of motivation directed towards learning may clarify the role of technology within pedagogy. Additionally, associating motivation and self-determination may be crucial in understanding motivation in professional nursing practice and education. This study determines the effect of mLearning on motivation to enhance CPD in nursing professionals (NP) analysed critically through a Self-Determination Theory lens. Twenty-three qualified nurses working within the clinical area participated by using a specific mobile application on their smartphone to learn nursing related skills. Over three weeks, participants logged in their learning experience, providing an overview of the relationship between motivation and mLearning. The nurses participating in the study found mLearning motivational in the clinical setting and indicated ownership of their learning, suggesting perceived autonomy. Furthermore, the mobile application enhanced nursing practices through gaining competency and fostered team building through interactions with other health professionals in the clinical area, demonstrating relatedness. This work suggests that having ownership of the learning experience fosters motivation through intrinsic and external needs, supporting learning and gaining competency in the clinical area. Also, the need to become competent and share with others further nurtures motivation to learn in the clinical area. Additionally, these findings suggest mLearning features that motivate NP towards clinical development. This study concludes with implications for the scholarship on mLearning for the continual practice development of nurses."

The purpose of this article is to review the existing research and show by examples how ethics and values are closely related to the specific functions of social media, such as distributing parody content and commenting on it. The main focus of our study is a parody which can be defined as communicative behavior in the form of a text, movement, or even a song, imitating the characteristics or behavior of the object being ridiculed. Unlike a literal quotation, a parody reproduces the original in a distorted form for the purpose of mockery. Within this article modern ethical approaches to the evaluation of parody as well as the main functions of parody in the digital environment are considered. Based on the examples of parody videos on TikTok the particular ways of expressing social problems and cultural traumas by using the comic strategies are identified. Furthermore, the issues of algorithmic censorship concerning such videos as well as the problem of the moral autonomy of users are discussed."

Sommer \nNon-technical Summary Nations across the world are concerned with environmental issues like forest loss. The majority of nations acknowledge the importance of reducing forest loss, and make commitments to do so. However, researchers often find that despite these commitments, and the work of non-governmental organizations, in many nations, forest loss is not declining. This research argues that institutional capacity, specifically a nations domestic autonomy may help explain the ineffectiveness of environmental international non-governmental organizations (EINGOs) at reducing forest loss. Specifically, I argue that nations with stronger domestic autonomy, measured as the extent to which a nation is free of the direct control of external political actors, improves the effectiveness of EINGOs at reaching their goals of reducing forest loss due to an autonomous state’s relative strength and ability to integrate their version of environmentalism or reinterpret existing norms of environmentalism into EINGO ideologies and activities. Technical Summary Previous research finds that environmental international non-governmental organizations (EINGOs) tend to have differential impacts on environmental factors cross-nationally, such as forest loss. More recent work argues that decoupling between stated environmental norms and actual environmental outcomes may be the result of a lack of institutional capacity. Using ordinary least squares regression for 91 low- and middle-income nations from 2001 to 2014, I find that EINGOs reduce forest loss more in nations with higher rather than lower levels of domestic autonomy. However, I find that EINGOs and domestic autonomy on their own do not significantly predict forest loss. Social media summary This research argues that a nations domestic autonomy may help explain the ineffectiveness EINGOs at reducing forest loss."

Two of the most important challenges to be addressed concern the protection of smart objects and the need to guarantee them a great autonomy. For this purpose, the definition of trust and reputation mechanisms appears crucial. At the same time, several researchers have started to adopt a common distributed ledger, such as a Blockchain, for building advanced solutions in the IoT. However, due to the high dimensionality of this problem, enabling a trust and reputation mechanism by leveraging a Blockchain-based technology could give rise to several performance issues in the IoT. In this paper, we propose a two-tier Blockchain framework to increase the security and autonomy of smart objects in the IoT by implementing a trust-based protection mechanism. In this framework, smart objects are suitably grouped into communities. To reduce the complexity of the solution, the first-tier Blockchain is local and is used only to record probing transactions performed to evaluate the trust of an object in another one of the same community or of a different community. Periodically, after a time window, these transactions are aggregated and the obtained values are stored in the second-tier Blockchain. Specifically, stored values are the reputation of each object inside its community and the trust of each community in the other ones of the framework. In this paper, we describe in detail our framework, its behavior, the security model associated with it and the tests carried out to evaluate its correctness and performance."

People tend to celebrate every technological and scientific advance without thinking properly about the possible undesired side effects or unexpected consequences. One of the most outstanding achievements of the last years has been the CRISPR/Cas9 technique. It seems to be the magic wand to solve whatever. In this article I propose to think critically about the ethical issues related to this incredible technique. I will focus this work on 3 ethical aspects of gene editing: 1. The link between gene editing and the old concept of eugenics; 2. Aspects related to the idea of modifying human genetics in order to conquer other planets and 3. The ethical implications of uploading all these data to the web. Finally, I suggest focusing on interdisciplinary ethical discussion, the dialogue between professionals, institutions and government which must ensure the protection of the autonomy of patients and the safeguarding of their rights. To conclude, the suggestion of considering the role of Universities in ethical education of the future professionals with a practical rather than a theoretical approach is considered, with special attention to the integration of cybernetics in medicine."

The proliferation of the notion of cyber sovereignty and its variances is a symptom reflecting sovereign states’ attempt to retain autonomy and control gradually eroded with the digitalisation of societies and economies. The sovereignty fever can be attributed to four reasons: political ambition, economic value, security concerns, and human rights. However, sovereignty is not the last word in debates concerning the future of digital society, for even liberal democracies have advanced ideas of technological or digital sovereignty, and data sovereignty, for their own very different purposes."

This study used the survey method in three ways: (1) mall intercept approach, (2) email survey, and (3) survey through Wechat. The sample was collected from 500 customers of electronic products living in Xi’an, China. The data analysis is done through structural equation modeling. Findings show that perceived product design in terms of functional, esthetic, and symbolic design is positively related to self-determined needs (autonomy, relatedness, competence) satisfaction. Furthermore, results reveal that self-determined needs satisfaction has a positive influence on customer engagement. The moderation results show that prevention focused customers moderate the relationship between functional design and self-determined needs satisfaction. Whereas, promotion focused customers moderate the relationship between esthetic design and self-determined needs satisfaction. This study adds value to the self-determination theory by examining the link between product design dimensions and customer engagement through self-determined needs satisfaction. Furthermore, this study adds value to the existing literature on regulatory focus theory."

It may, however, pose a major challenge for some higher education students. One of the vulnerable groups is that of learners with special needs, and particularly Deaf, deaf and hard of hearing students. These learners are limited in their chances to interact in spoken/written foreign languages and in the learning opportunities they can join. This, by extension, has an unfavourable impact on their possibilities of engaging in study abroad. Based on the experience with a newly launched e-learning course “Online English for International Mobilities”, the present paper discusses the need for building effective FL learning strategies in Deaf, deaf and hard of hearing students in connection with the process of academic internationalisation. The main argument is for the need to foster students’ ability to self-regulate, reduce their teacher dependency and reliance on directed learning, and to encourage them to take responsibility for their own learning. Secondly, the paper provides a comparison of two pilot runs of the course from the perspective of (online) classroom dynamics and cooperation. While the course is built to be as autonomous as possible and benefits from the advantages of the e-learning format, great importance is given to group dynamics and cooperation via discussion forums and online chats. It also takes advantage of the considerable benefits of individualized, personalized feedback being provided by teachers on selected assignments."

Vogelzang \n Amar Kanekar \nIntroduction. Vaccine hesitancy in parents is a composite of multiple dimensions such as confidence, complacency, and convenience. A large proportion of parents can be deemed vaccine hesitant, meaning that their vaccine behaviors can range from delaying vaccines, skipping select vaccines, to refusal of all vaccinations. Furthermore, parental vaccine uptake rates and patterns can reflect their decisions based on the balance of parental autonomy versus protecting population health. The current manuscript uses Social Network Theory to explain some of the external influences on parental autonomy. Social networks, both private and public, play a role in vaccine decision making through providing information and support for parents in their choices. This influence, in turn, is mediated by parents’ health literacy and local vaccination policy. Discussion. Social media is an important type of public network that has an outsized influence on vaccine hesitancy. The rhetoric used on anti-vaccine websites often denigrates scientific evidence while at the same time endorsing poor-quality evidence that supports the anti-vaccine point of view. The websites continually propose new hypotheses of how vaccines can cause harm when studies refute their previous assertions, censor critics, and attack people with opposing viewpoints. The contentious nature of vaccine hesitancy based on beliefs, opinions, and attitudes needs a solution much deeper than simply providing factual knowledge or pointing people to reliable websites. Recommendations. Public health practitioners and researchers should try segmenting audiences, targeting private and public social networks, and then testing which persuasive strategies towards vaccinations appeal to different community groups."

There are perceptibly no limitations to the utility of e-learning tools in the cognitive domain of learning. It complements traditional learning in other domains, namely, psychomotor, affective and communication skill, fairly well. Not only does it ease learning in terms of availability and accessibility, but with the options of asynchronous learning and personalisation of content, it also empowers learners with more autonomy. Despite the limitation of lack of ‘hands-on’ training and experience with e-learning, it has been accepted quite well, although initially both teachers and learners had been skeptical about its applicability and quality. In the ongoing pandemic period, e-learning may assume a bigger role as blended learning in medical education. While this transition may be smooth for the better resourced nations who already have the required infrastructure and resources ready, the resource limited nations may first have to develop the same before being able to implement it. Ensuring the availability of cheap and high-speed internet, computers in various forms (desktops, laptops, tablets and smartphones) within reach of every learner, will enable them to go online."

We utilize a self-determination theory-based framework for understanding how the FoMO phenomenon influences positive (negative) mood, information overload, social media satisfaction, and engagement with social media advertising. Study 1 explores how FoMO relates to positive mood through the need to belong. Study 2 demonstrates how FoMO impacts information overload through the mediation of social media interactivity. Furthermore, Study 2 shows how FoMO alters social media satisfaction, and this relationship is mediated by information overload and moderated by autonomy. Study 3 shows that negative emotions serve to mediate the effect of information overload on engagement with social media advertising. Finally, we discuss implications of this study to provide insight into how brand marketers can offer FoMO-reducing mechanisms to consumers to ensure a high level of advertising engagement, how health advocates can leverage social media to promote meaningful engagement with consumers, and how industry practitioners may want to consider aspirational virtual events to create buzz while also satisfying consumers’ need to belong to social groups."

Blended education combines the advantages of traditional education and online education to complement each other. It not only takes advantage of the flexibility and autonomy of online education but also retains the benefits of emotional communication between teachers and students in offline education. With the increase in practical exploration of blended teaching in universities, teaching evaluation is an important part of teaching, and blended teaching evaluation should also attract attention. The purpose of this paper is to study the mixed oral English teaching evaluation based on the mixed mode of SPOC and deep learning. On the basis of analyzing the teaching design principles of the mixed mode of SPOC and deep learning and the principles of constructing the teaching evaluation after half a semester of teaching investigations conducted by the two classes of English majors, the impact of the SPOC and deep learning mixed teaching mode on students’ spoken English was studied through the method of covariance analysis. The experimental results show that the mixed teaching mode of SPOC and deep learning has been able to fully stimulate students’ interest in oral English learning and improve students’ oral English ability, critical thinking of students, ability to solve problems, group cooperation, and effective communication. Self-directed learning and self-reflection have all had a positive impact."

This study seeks to understand the differences in user satisfaction with a chatbot system vis-a-vis a menu-based interface system, and identify factors that influence user satisfaction. Grounded in the self-determination theory, the research model proposed here focuses on the effect of chatbot use on perceived autonomy, perceived competence, cognitive load, performance satisfaction, and system satisfaction. An experimental study was conducted, and data were analyzed using Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling. The findings indicate that chatbot systems lead to a lower level of perceived autonomy and higher cognitive load, compared with menu-based interface systems, resulting in a lower degree of user satisfaction. Implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed. • Chatbot are associated with a lower level of perceived autonomy and higher cognitive load, compared with menu interface. • Perceived autonomy and perceived competence have a significant effect on performance satisfaction and system satisfaction. • Perceived competence was a stronger predictor of performance satisfaction. • Perceived autonomy was a stronger predictor of system satisfaction. • Perceived autonomy positively influences perceived competence."

It proposes that a new interdisciplinary field of inquiry–a phenomenology of communications–implicates culture in that all communication helps shape and reflects a society’s cultural assumptions and aspirations. In an era of social media and electronic communication, the impact on culture has accelerated. Both positive and negative aspects of social media reverberate in American popular culture that Christopher Lasch described as a culture of narcissism and David Brooks calls a culture of the “Big Me.” The essay revisits a documentary about Mike Tyson’s life and career that exemplifies what it means to be an American, renewing a culture that aspires to redeem the American dream of a more perfect union beyond preference and prejudice. It shows also why American culture needs to be transformed from a narcissistic, self-referential, tribal perspective of identity politics and false tolerance toward a culture that respects individual autonomy and privacy, reconnects rights and responsibilities, and encourages true diversity, inspired by transcendent norms and ideals worthy of a creature created in the image and likeness of God."

For survivors of online sexual exploitation involved in this study, technology played a critical role in their abuse, making it necessary to understand how technology-supported communication can also play in their recovery and personal development. Drawing upon the thematic analysis of data collected from debriefing, interviews, and participants-generated videos, the findings have shown that the participatory video as a tool to support communication, as a mirror for reflexivity and voicing, and as a mediated space to connect and gain support, affords a communicative platform for survivors to participate, to interact, and to take control of the technology. We argue that the use of Information and Communication Technology for empowerment is subject to the personalized needs, autonomy and participation of the users ."

Ortiz \n Roberto Pereira \nComputational Thinking (CT) is considered one of the most needed abilities of the 21st Century as the usage of digital resources has become more and more frequent. Research on CT teaching has been growing over the last decade and Brazilian initiatives have focused on Elementary and High School students while less privileged audiences, such as non-literate citizens, are rarely addressed. The lack of literacy affects more than communication, but autonomy for economic, cultural and educational development, social interaction, and also the experience with information and communication technology. Non-literate citizens represent more than 11 million people in Brazil, and Youth and Adults Education (YAE) is an educational modality offered to these citizens. In this article, we present the main results from a Master’s research that investigated CT as a means to reduce YAE’s students’ rejection and fear of technology, aware of their characteristics, contexts, and particularities. In our research, we consider that through the practice of CT people can comprehend how technology works and how it can be used, favoring familiarity, and reducing rejection and fear of technology. Grounded on Computing and Education literature, we conceived a model to plan and conduct initiatives for YAE, applying and studying our model in a case study conducted inside a Brazilian public school during 8 workshops with 17 participants. For the case study, 9 principles to support the practice with YAE students were identified and used to inform 12 activities created/adapted for practicing CT throughout the workshops. A research overview is presented, along with its theoretical grounds to the main results from the case study and lessons learned. Results show the model as promising to inform practices to exercise CT abilities, sensitive to the audience’s context."

Subsequent events such as bankruptcy of Cambridge Analytica and a significant drop in the stock prices of Facebook (a fall of 24%, equivalent to $134 billion.) were an integral part of this research paper to explore the role of the attitudes of the business entities over bankruptcy in these kinds of scandals. Thereby, a comparison technique has been employed to analyze the ethical dimension of the bankruptcy of Cambridge Analytica, and how the attitude of Facebook provided a chance of survival and recovery within this process. The outcome of the research clearly identifies that even in the corporative entities bypassing or violating the ethical standards can be observed. Albeit, there is a strong correlation between the degree of ethical standards and the sustainability of the businesses from the aspect of customers, partners, and the government. The article continued with the analysis of the significance of the immediate implementation of the ethical standards and deterrent defense with a manner of “bona fide” in these types of scandals to handle the crisis. The research concluded with an ethical analysis of data analysis and data mining from the Kantian definition of autonomy, Jurgen Habermas’s definition of privacy in the era of digitalization."

For this purpose, two secondary-level English teachers were selected purposively, and in-depth interviews were conducted to collect data. The collected data were analyzed using the thematic analysis technique. The findings drawn from the lived experience of the teachers reveal that teachers become ICT literate and updated by taking formal classes, training, and teaching their students; they make use of ICT in ELT for students’ language development, motivation, and autonomy. The challenge of keeping the students on the right track is the major challenge English language teachers encounter while integrating ICT in ELT. Though there are challenges, every English language teacher should try to teach the English language integrating ICT."

However, the exposition of emotions by emotion-aware chatbots undermines human autonomy and users’ trust. One way to ensure autonomy is through the provision of control. Offering too much control, in turn, may increase users’ cognitive effort. To investigate the impact of control over emotion-aware chatbots on autonomy, trust, and cognitive effort, as well as user behavior, we carried out an experimental study with 176 participants. The participants interacted with a chatbot that provided emotional feedback and were additionally able to control different chatbot dimensions (e.g., timing, appearance, and behavior). Our findings show, first, that higher control levels increase autonomy and trust in emotion-aware chatbots. Second, higher control levels do not significantly increase cognitive effort. Third, in our post hoc behavioral analysis, we identify four behavioral control strategies based on control feature usage timing, quantity, and cognitive effort. These findings shed light on the individual preferences of user control over emotion-aware chatbots. Overall, our study contributes to the literature by showing the positive effect of control over emotion-aware chatbots and by identifying four behavioral control strategies. With our findings, we also provide practical implications for future design of emotion-aware chatbots. • In this study, we investigated the effect of control over emotion-aware chatbots. • Rising ability to control emotion-aware chatbots increases user autonomy and trust. • At the same time, a higher level of control does not increase cognitive effort. • Analyzing users’ control behavior, we identified four distinct control strategies. • Users can be categorized as Soloists, Kickstarter, Controller, and Undecideds."

In this study, we examine how technostress affects knowledge hiding. Drawing from the energy-consuming characteristic of technostress and prior research on how technostress affects ICT users, this article builds and tests a model that takes work exhaustion as a mediator and explores the moderating role of job autonomy. To test our conceptual model, we examined the responses to a survey questionnaire submitted by 287 ICT users from multiple organizations. Using structural equation modeling, we found that technostress increases employees’ knowledge hiding behavior, and work exhaustion partially mediates technostress and knowledge hiding, while job autonomy only moderates the relationship between technostress and work exhaustion when the fourth factor of technostress, viz., techno-insecurity, is excluded. We also discuss future research directions and implications of the results."

Taken together, key resources and demands have a significant influence on nurses’ work engagement under pandemic conditions. However, not all so-called key resources and demands actually have a key status in a pandemic.Any lack of formal rewards should be countered, professional resources should be sustainably secured, and the autonomy of nurses and their interpersonal relationships should be strengthened.

Therefore, a brief contextualization is outlined on how the discipline has been organized in the Basic Education curriculum in face of the technological changes that take place at the turn of the 20th century with the advent of information and communication technologies (ICTs) The methodology used is a qualitative approach in a descriptive and exploratory character, which will analyze some bibliographical productions on the subject and the discussion of two You Tube channels.The dialogues with Pinsky (2016), Bispo and Barros (2016), Castells (1999), Queiroga Junior (2018), Coelho and Bottentuit Junior (2019), Correa (2002) and Pereira (2017), open up possibilities for thinking about the teaching of History mediated by ICTs. Among the results obtained, there is the relevance of thinking about mediated educational projects by educational technologies that contribute to the achievement of autonomy of the deaf person, respecting their different ways of learning."

We meta-analytically synthesize and integrate existing literature on the consequences of ICT use based on the job demands-resources model. By using meta-analytical structural equation modeling based on 63 independent studies ( N = 26,295), we shed light on the relationship between ICT use and employees’ well-being (operationalized as burnout and engagement) in a model that incorporates the mediating role of ICT-related resources and demands. Results show that ICT use is opposingly related to burnout and engagement through autonomy, availability, and work-life conflict. Our study brings clarity into the contradictory results and highlights the importance of a simultaneous consideration of both positive and negative effects for a comprehensive understanding of the relationship. We further show that the time of use and managerial position, and methodological moderators can clarify heterogeneity in previous results."

A study of mobile applications \nhttps://doi.org/10.3127/ajis.v25i0.3105\n Deepak Sangroya \n Rambalak Yadav \n Yatish Joshi \nIn recent times gamification has increasingly been used by brands through smartphones to interact effectively with their consumers. The core assumption for creating gamified environment is that it will develop engagement with the consumer and motivate them to use their product or services. However, beyond this assumption, there is dearth empirical evidence regarding how much effective these gamified features are in engaging consumers. Therefore, this research analyses the relationship between flow, brand engagement, self-brand connection and brand usage intent among consumers (N = 360)of two gamified mobile applications. The findings show that the multidimensional construct flow formed by five dimensions i.e. challenge, feedback, autonomy, immersion, and interaction positively associates with cognitive brand engagement and emotional brand engagement. Additionally, both these forms of brand engagement further strengthen consumers’ brand connection and motivate them for further use. These results imply that gamified environment can augment consumer engagement with brand and further increase usage intention. Therefore, gamification can be an effective technique in brand management and brand managers can use it to strengthen relationship with consumers and increasing possibility of using their brands."

A case study approach was adopted to examine how two firms in the lighting facility and ICT industries use digital platforms to coordinate their diverse, large and dynamic modular solution networks. Our findings reveal that due to contradictory goals in offering diverse customized solutions, solution providers with digital platforms are facing several paradoxical tensions between flexibility and efficiency, control and autonomy, and standardization and customization. We find that solution providers cope with these paradoxes through implementing two simultaneous mechanisms: unification and diversification. While the diversification mechanism aims at increasing variety among modules and module providers, unification focuses on forming similarities among them. These mechanisms are made possible through digital platform features, such as algorithms, online communities and platform access. This study contributes to the B2B literature by highlighting the nested nature of paradoxical tensions in the context of modular solution networks and by identifying mechanisms for managing these paradoxes. It also offers practical tools to solution providers to identify and manage paradoxical tensions in platform-based modular solution networks. • This study reveals three types of paradoxes in platform-based solution networks. • These paradoxes can be managed by unification and diversification mechanisms. • These mechanisms are made possible through digital platform features. • The study also offers practical tools to identify and manage these paradoxes."

    "text": "Doc 1527 :  New Educational Technologies: Connection or Autonomy? \nhttps://doi.org/10.1177/104515959901000402\n Amy D. Rose \nNew educational technologies offer the potential to affect service to all learners, but especially adult learners. Because of this fact, adult educators have become enamored by the possibilities offered through the Internet, distance education, and computers in general. Recently, Adult Learning covered this topic several times. Key research trends deal with the following issues: How much do the new technologies improve access to adult education? Are they as good, in terms of learning outcomes, as more traditional approaches? Are they better than traditional approaches? Are they appropriate for certain groups and not others? If so, what are the parameters of these differences? Are some groups excluded by the heightened emphasis on learning via distance and/or by computer? What are the policy implications of these findings? This column begins an examination of the meaning of new technologies both to educators and the general public. At every turn, there are those who hailed technological breakthroughs as the ultimate panacea; the point at which access will finally be opened and the hurdles to learning will evaporate. It is useful to remember that the Internet and computers are part of a long chain of innovations that have simultaneously promised diffusion and the possibility of interaction. Of course, the first in this chain of diffusion was the printing press, followed by the lending library, which was not a technological innovation. The lending library is still viewed as a democratic invention that encourages the spread of knowledge. Andrew Carnegie, whose Corporation would later be so instrumental in funding organized adult education, had as his primary philanthropic mission the establishment of public libraries. In terms of modern efforts at technology and diffusion, the telephone at one time was hailed as a new educational invention, followed by movies, radio, and television. All offered the potential of allowing people to continue their learning in a convenient fashion, with the possibility of immediate access. The library, nonetheless, preceded all of these. While each provide important sources of diffusion, none live up to the promise of diffusing information to every corner of society. Yet the dream continues. Those writing about the Internet emphasize the possibility it offers for immediate access to information. The new wrinkle, of course is the opportunity for immediate feedback and discussion, which earlier innovations did not possess. This is not quite true, however, since back in the nineteenth century, the telephone possessed the same potential. While all of education is subject to fads, it seems that adult education has more than its share. This is probably due to adult education’s lack of an organized structure with its’ built-in system of control. As many writers indicate, this allows for greater flexibility, but it also precludes the development of a coherent vision. A field without a sense of vision cannot really develop, it merely spurts ahead in many different directions. What, then is the vision presented by the new technologies? This vision is quite simple and embodies principles that define efforts at adult education and diffusion for over one hundred years. They present the possibility of education on demand. The dream is that when computers become the norm, people will be able to access information from all over the world. This is the notion that somehow the wires of technology will replace the older traditions that connected people to each other. …"

The term policy has come to be used in different ways in public administration and business management orientations. Administrators, for instance use policy in its original sense to mean a course of action formulated by a collective constituency, or a legislative body.On the other hand, the management people, especially, in India use the term ‘policy’ rather mechanistically, (and imprecisely) to mean merely a set of guidelines which may be used to formulate an official course of action. This latter interpretation, often, negates the basic principle that a policy must evolve out of the ‘pol’ (a collective in Greek, equivalent to ‘palli’ in Dravidian) and must continue to be anchored in the collective forms of rationality. Such an anchorage would justify the requirements of legitimacy, sovereignty, autonomy, and hierarchy, in the cybernetics of decision-making."

It is clearly argued that Longstanding Problems such as faculty quality, Problems Faced by Students and Insufficient Resources and Autonomy are the most significant challenges of higher education in Iran. New Realities resulted from new revolutions such as the internet and distance learning are also playing vital role in shaping the new higher education era in Iran.IntroductionToday, global wealth is concentrated less and less in factories, land, tools, and machinery. The knowledge, skills, and resourcefulness of people are increasingly critical to the world economy. Human capital in the United States is now estimated to be at least three times more important than physical capital. A century ago, this would not have been the case (Emily Hannun & Claudia Buchmann, 2003). The developed world is reacting quickly, with education a major political priority. High-quality human capital is developed in high-quality education systems, with tertiary education providing the advanced skills that command a premium in today’s workplace (College Board, 2004).Most developed countries have seen a substantial rise in the proportion of their young people receiving higher education. Lifelong learning is also being used to help workers adjust to rapidly changing economies (International Comparisons of 4-year College Continuation Rates, 2001). During the past two or three decades, however, attention has focused on primary education, especially for girls. This has led to a neglect of secondary and tertiary education, with higher education in a perilous state in many, if not most, developing countries. With a few notable exceptions, it is underfunded by governments and donors. As a result, quality is low and often deteriorating, while access remains limited. Higher education institutions (and whole systems) are politicized, poorly regulated, and sometimes corrupt (Burton Bollag, 2004).We believe that a more balanced approach to education at all levels is needed. The focus on primary education is important, but an approach that pursues primary education alone will leave societies dangerously unprepared for survival in tomorrow’s world. We live in a period of major structural change. The classic industrial revolution that started in the United Kingdom at the end of the eighteenth century spread gradually and unevenly to Europe and beyond (United Joint Economic Committee States Congress, 2000). By the end of the twentieth century, a number of so-called follower countries had joined the ranks of industrial nations, and today industrial countries are found throughout the world. Some have narrowed, and even closed, the gap between rich and poor, with the East Asian countries being a good example. Average incomes have tended to increase across the world (except in Sub-Saharan Africa) in the past 20 years, although one-quarter of the world’s population still lives in abject poverty. Advances in information technology, meanwhile, have made this ever-increasing volume of knowledge more accessible, effective, and powerful. Networked computers and new forms of telecommunications spread information around the world with dazzling speed (Steven J. Rosenstone & John Mark Hansen, 2003).The Internet, in particular, means that more knowledge than ever is in circulation. Those who have the skills to use it have access to an extraordinarily valuable (and sustainable) resource (Emily Hannun & Claudia Buchmann, 2004).Longstanding Problems and New Realities Faculty QualityA well-qualified and highly motivated faculty is critical to the quality of higher education institutions. Unfortunately, even at flagship universities in developing countries, many faculty members have little, if any, graduate-level training. This limits the level of knowledge imparted to students and restricts the students’ ability to access existing knowledge and generate new ideas (Heath A. …"

Petruk \n N.V Shashlo \nThe article focuses on studying the modern trends of digital transformation of the management system of institutions of additional education of schoolchildren. Theoretical and methodological provisions have been scientifically substantiated and practical recommendations have been developed to improve the management system of additional education of schoolchildren in the context of digital transformations. It is proved that the institution of extracurricular education is also a community characterized by dedication, formal and informal structures, autonomy, cyclicality, freedom of choice of extracurricular activities. For the first time it was proposed to use a system-cybernetic approach to the strategic management of institutions of additional education of schoolchildren based on the procedural model of strategic management and the information management system, tested in the management system of Russian Childrenʼs Center “Ocean”. It is proved that Management Information Systems (MIS) uses the information necessary for top managers at all levels in making operational, tactical and strategic decisions. The advantages and positive factors for institutions of the sphere of additional education of schoolchildren from the introduction of MIS within the boundaries of the procedural model of strategic management are highlighted. The characteristic features of the management activities of the subjects of management of institutions of additional education of schoolchildren are outlined. There are presented the management models, the knowledge of which will provide the heads of organizations of extracurricular education with data on selecting MIS. The importance of further development of the theory, methodology and practice in the strategic management of additional education of schoolchildren in the context of digital transformations has been proved."

Yakovleva \n Eduard S. Ibragimov \nThe article is devoted to the formation features of the civic consciousness among the youth in mass culture and media communications. Civil self-consciousness is represented through a system of personal values, a person’s ideas about himself as a citizen, as well as about the state and society where he belongs and in relation to which he is self-determined.\n The purpose of the article is to present how the youth consumes the mass culture products and socio-political media content in the context of the formation process of their civic consciousness. The design of an empirical study is based on the principles of a political and psychological approach. The empirical basis of the research is the materials of the All-Russian survey of the youth aged 18 to 30 years, conducted in 2020 using the formalized interview procedure (n = 1600) and the in-depth interview method (n = 200), as well as the materials of the expert survey (n = 20). The materials reveal attitudes of the youth to printed publications, television content, Internet resources, film products, fiction, musical compositions, perception characteristics of the presented socio-political information. The character of media consumption among the youth is determined by the values of freedom and autonomy, justice, truth and truthfulness, and trust in information sources that are significant for them. The lack of critical thinking skills necessary for processing and analyzing a huge array of information determines their primitive perception of the political, the inability to identify political plots and political problems presented in the works of mass culture, a high degree of reactivity to the appearance of various media products. The civic consciousness formation of the youth becomes “broken” and fragmented under the influence of the media space as a factor of political socialization."

However, the introduction of ICT in long-term care (LTC) in Japan has not yielded good results yet, and the social acceptance of ICT remains understudied. This study aimed to understand and examine people’s views on ICT use in LTC settings. An online vignette survey was conducted in August 2020, among community-dwelling persons between the ages of 40–89 years, throughout Japan. A set of four vignettes of different physical and cognitive functional situations, at either a home or nursing home, with or without ICT use, was presented to select a preferred care setting. Multinomial regression analyses were used to examine the relationships between participants’ choices and individual characteristics. A total of 4,457 participants (52.8% of whom were women) were analyzed (mean age = 60.8 years). Participants were more likely to choose nursing homes in cognitively dependent situations. Participants who were women, relatively younger, and had higher education were more likely to choose care settings employing ICT for physically and cognitively dependent situations. Those who experienced either informal or formal caregiving were more likely to choose care settings that used ICT. This study revealed that individuals preferred different levels of ICT use based on physical and cognitive situations. Barriers to introducing ICT in LTC settings will be discussed."

This paper explores a section of the book focusing on Amish strategies for internet management. These strategies are in place to protect Amish communities from perceived negative impacts of technologically mediated connectivity. Today it is increasingly common for the Amish to adopt computers, the internet and mobile devices in calculated ways to remain competitive in business. Often the use of these devices blends into the personal sphere as well. This research is notable for its empirical observations that show shared values are key to determining patterns of technology use in Amish communities. Data was collected via semi-structured interviews with thought-leaders (business and religious leaders) in Indiana Amish settlements. Findings show that the Amish consider their own cultural, social, political and religious autonomy in deciding how to engage with a broader social and economic system as technologies are essential to the mediation of these relationships."

However, many manufacturers have difficulty determining to what extent these various technologies can reinforce the autonomy of teams and operational systems. This article addresses this issue by proposing a model describing different types of autonomy and the contribution of 4.0 technologies in the various steps of the decision-making processes. The model was confronted with a set of application cases from the literature. It emerges that new technologies’ improvements are significant from a decision-making point of view and may eventually favor implementing new modes of autonomy. Decision-makers can rely on the proposed model to better understand the opportunities linked to the fusion of cybernetic, physical, and social spaces made possible by Industry 4.0."

We explored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on daily activities and mental health and its relationship with cognitive performance in older adults. Methods One-hundred individuals 60 years and older, without cognitive impairment and enrolled in the Brazilian Memory Study (BRAMS), a longitudinal study, were applied the UCLA Loneliness Scale, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Participants were asked whether they had changes in daily routine and social connectedness during the pandemic. Results Almost half of the participants (48.4%) reported that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected their lives, 38.9% lost a relative or friend because of COVID-19, and 60% had daily routine changes. Relationships (40.5%) and emotion (22%) were reported as the most impacted area. Stopping physical activities and stay at home represented the main routine changed for 78% of participants. The use of voice messages through mobile phones to maintain social connectedness increased from 24.2% to 42.1%. For 38% of participants, their autonomy to daily decisions decreased, and 40% complained that memory got worse during the pandemic. More than 30% felt more stress, loneliness, or depression than in the pre-pandemic period. Controlling for age, sex, and education, higher loneliness scores were significantly associated with low MMES scores (p = 0.018). Conclusion Significant changes in life, daily routine, social connectedness, and mental health-related to the COVID-19 pandemic were reported by older adult participants. Loneliness was associated with lower cognitive performance."

As China’s education industry continues to pursue international development, it is necessary to train a large number of international talents who have an international perspective, are familiar with international rules, and can participate in international affairs and international competition. However, to become an international talent, you must first have superior English communication skills and be able to deal with various international situations proficiently. The English education goals at the basic education stage are simply beyond reach and can only be cultivated through professional and systematic college English courses. This shows that college English education is at a crucial position in the future development of education. This study attempts to explore how to apply the interactive teaching mode supported by WeChat network platform in translation teaching and English learning of high school students, so as to improve students’ autonomy in translation practice, promote students’ personalized learning, and improve students’ interest and ability in English learning. Based on the investigation of a senior high school in our city, the school began to implement the interactive translation mobile teaching mode based on WeChat in September 2018. The experiment selected the change of students’ English learning achievements in a certain semester and judged whether the mobile teaching mode was conducive to the improvement of learning performance based on t-test. We also need to collect the needs of teachers and parents for the WeChat based mobile teaching mode and judge whether the mode can be promoted. The experimental results show that this teaching mode has an obvious effect on the improvement of students’ English scores, especially in the eighth grade, whose scores have increased from 72.6 to 75. Through the construction of WeChat based interactive translation mobile teaching mode, parents can fully understand the key points of English learning and make English tutoring more targeted and timely. This teaching mode is worthy of promotion in senior high school English course learning."

That in turn gives us significant insights on how to improve the distribution and control of power in Egypt to warrant greater autonomy and representativeness in the branches of government. Design/methodology/approach The proposed diagnostic framework in this study was accomplished by applying the principles and aspects of Stafford Beer’s VSM to the three state powers of Egypt: the executive, legislative and judiciary. In addition, it adopts the guidelines for applying the VSM described by both Stafford Beer and José Pérez Ríos. Findings The presented framework in this study shows a comprehensive explanation of the essential functions and their distribution among the entities of the Egyptian political system. In addition to that, the findings give us insights about the need for greater autonomy and self-organization among the political system’s entities. Greater communication, consensus, cooperation and coordination is needed to achieve balance, regulate the interactions between them and to monitor each other without intervention. This, in turn, would ensure greater representation of citizen demands and expectations, and protect and guarantee their rights and freedoms. Originality/value The modeling of the Egyptian political system from a VSM perspective suggests the necessity of reform of the political system by a clear division of functions and tasks within the operational entities and subentities, decentralization of power structures and utilization of the decision marketing mechanism to reach public acceptance. The application of the VSM, for the sake of diagnosing and designing the viability of separation of power, can be considered as highly original."

Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was applied to analyze the mediating effects with the Bootstrapping method by SPSS 21.0 and AMOS 20.0.Results: In the model, online-based leisure significantly mediated the relationship between positive parenting attitudes such as warmth, autonomy support and structure provision, and smartphone dependency showing complete mediation. Also, negative parenting attitudes such as rejection, coercion, and chaos directly negatively affected smartphone dependency, not showing a mediating effect. Results indicate that increased positive parenting attitudes lead to reduced smartphone dependency through decreasing online-based leisure, while negative parenting attitudes lead to increase dependence on the smartphone.Conclusion: While positive parenting attitudes do not directly affect smartphone dependency, they lead to a decrease in online-based leisure. Consequently, as online-based leisure lessens, smartphone dependency subsequently may also be diminished. In addition, although negative parenting attitudes have no mediating effect, they directly influence the growing smartphone dependency. Results confirm that positive parenting mediate the effects of online-based activities in relation to smartphone dependency when parents provide the most structure, autonomy support, and warmth to their children. Practical implications are discussed, and relevant interventions offered for children and parents."

Indispensable for medically monitoring women’s reproductive bodies, the mobile phone enters the process for producing female gametes and contributes to the gender asymmetry typical of biomedicalized procreation. It is also used to maintain contacts with transnational family members who, from a distance, obtrude in the woman’s reproductive life. The use of mobile phones extends biomedical power over the woman’s body into her everyday life and the normative power of her transnational family into reproduction. Paradoxically, the mobile telephone allows collateral relatives to support the woman seeking reproduction assistance while also “hypermedicalizing” the woman’s daily life. Also paradoxically, this everyday companion is conductive to individual autonomy while also being used for new forms of surveillance and control. The data come from fieldwork conducted in the greater Paris area between 2011 and 2013 within a network of ART professionals and their patients."

This study attempts to link employees’ social media use at work to their creativity performance. Design/methodology/approach Based on the bounded generalized reciprocity theory and unbounded indirect reciprocity (UIR) theory, the authors developed a research model. To test the model, the authors collected a set of 172 paired data of organizations and employees from 31 knowledge-intensive enterprises in China to test the hypothesis. Findings This research found that the social, cognitive and hedonic uses of social media all directly affect employee creativity. Relational energy fully mediates the effects of the cognitive and hedonic usages on creativity. Moreover, job autonomy moderates the effects of the relationships among the social, cognitive and hedonic uses on employee creativity. Originality/value The conclusions not only enriched authors’ understanding of the effectiveness of interpersonal interaction but also extended the research boundary of the relationship between SMU and employee creativity."

Our systems, built on top of Web technologies, enable novel possibilities of collective and collaborative interaction, in particular by simplifying public access to the artwork by presenting the work through the web browser of their smartphone/tablet. Additionally, such a technical framework can be extended with so-called nano-computers, microprocessors and sensors. The infrastructure is completely agnostic as to how many clients are attached, or how they connect, which means that if the work is available in a public space, groups of friends, or even informally organised flash mobs, may engage with the work and perform the contents of the work at any time, and if available over the Internet, at any place. More than the technical details, the specific artistic directions or the supposed autonomy of the agents of our systems, this article focuses on how such ‘networks of devices’ interleave with the ‘network of humans’ composed of the people visiting the installation or participating in the concert. Indeed, we postulate that an important point in understanding and describing such proposals is to consider the relation between these two networks , the way they co-exist and entangle themselves through perception and action. To exemplify these ideas, we present a number of case studies, sound installations and concert works, very different in scope and artistic goal, and examine how this interaction is materialised from several standpoints."

This phenomenon indicates the strength of a highly temporal and mobile capital, pitted against workers not just in Lagos but around the world. This article adopts James Scott’s notion of everyday resistance in exposing some of the hidden practices of platform drivers in Lagos. It finds that sabotaging and falsely complying through manipulating algorithms and gaming spaces for rewards are facilitated by social media and communication networks, are deliberate, hidden practices to subvert algorithmic control. While Lagos is a unique case in the global South, examples from global North cities highlight some peculiarity. A robust qualitative methodology was conducted comprising semistructured interviews, focus group discussions, and participant observations from forty Uber and Bolt trips. Other primary data sources include driver forums, attending driver training sessions and listening to transport radio programs. This article identifies temporal and spatial dynamics in recognizing everyday hidden practices as not always hidden, but dispersed and inconsistent because of the mutual learning capabilities between platform drivers and algorithmic managers. The hidden transcripts of platform drivers delve into public realms and back following, enabling platform drivers to develop new hidden practices, typifying a continuous power struggle in Lagos."

Such interactions cause many social and cultural problems, one of which is marital well-being. The paper aims at studying the potential impact of digital space and social networks on marital relationship. The methodological basis of the study is a systematic approach to the study of social objects, interpretive research paradigm, multidisciplinary analysis. Information base of the research are monographs, articles, conference proceedings, reports, blogs. The search was conducted using the following keywords: mass culture, social networks, Internet, social media, digital space, marital relationship, mental health, psychological well-being, marital satisfaction. Social media offers a diverse experience for each user. The researchers state that this experience is largely positive that explains the growing use of social networks around the world. However, the use of social networks has its significant drawbacks and can threaten marital harmony. Danger factors are information that can arouse suspicion and uncertainty in a relationship; excessive control over partners in social networks, which destroys the sense of autonomy and privacy; excessive time spent in networks and intrusive signs of their use; disclosure of private information; insufficient privacy control; online adulteries that can cause divorce; feelings of worthlessness and dissatisfaction, which often arise as a result of comparing the personal offline reality with the online reality of the actors of communication processes and leads to frustration and depression."

Jun \n• Immersive and interactive cyber-physical system (I 2 CPS) framework for collaboration between human, autonomy, and physical systems. • Middleware and data-to-operation protocol were combined to communicate information with the wide range of contexts. • A new interface with virtual reality to provide the collaborative environment for augmenting human skills and autonomy. Smart manufacturing promotes the demand of new interfaces for communication with autonomies such as big data analysis, digital twin, and self-decisive control. Collaboration between human and the autonomy becomes imperative factor for improving productivity. However, current human-machine interfaces (HMI) such as 2D screens or panels require human knowledge of process and long-term experience to operate, which is not intuitive for beginning workers or is designed to work with the autonomy. This study proposes a human interface framework of cyber-physical system (CPS) based on virtual reality, named as immersive and interactive CPS (I 2 CPS), to create an interface for human-machine-autonomy collaboration. By combination of data-to-information protocol and middleware, MTConnect and Robot Operating System (ROS), heterogeneous physical systems were integrated with virtual assets such as digital models, digital shadows, and virtual traces of human works in the virtual reality (VR) based interface. All the physical and virtual assets were integrated in the interface that human, autonomy, and physical system can collaborate. Applying constraints in the VR interface and deploying virtual human works to industrial robots were demonstrated to verify the effectiveness of the I 2 CPS framework, showing collaboration between human and autonomy: augmentation of human skills by autonomy and virtual robot teaching to generate automatic robot programs."

According to the well-established opinion of specialists in social sciences and humanities, a person diffracts his selves in the modern world: real spaces (professions, statuses) and virtual (accounts, profiles). In the diffraction of a person through spaces of different order, each “new” self acquires relative autonomy (a trace of the self in the network, which is present regardless of the attitude to it), and at the same time there remains the connection that, as it were, keeps the self with his digital images and “prints”. The main questions of the article are: in what relation and in relation to what is it possible to talk about the identity of a modern person; what fundamentally significant do the researches on human identity give us today; what do those who ask questions about personal identity in the digital age focus their attention on? In order to answer these questions, let us turn to scientific articles from domestic and foreign journals. This article presents the analytics of publications from Scopus and RSCI databases, in which the problem of personal identity is posed. The purpose of the article is to analyze scientific publications on human identity and summarize the main ideas presented in those publications. Methods. The research is based on general scientific methods, analysis and synthesis, induction, deduction, and abstraction. The author analyzes scientific publications on the basis of the interpretation method and a systematic approach method. Content analysis was used as a method, but it was used within the scope of the purpose. The publications were selected on the basis of the authors’ research of various aspects of identity and the difference in interpreting the phenomenon. Results. Analysis of Scopus publications made it possible to assert that the problem of identity is moving out of the anthropological context and acquiring new technical and technological frameworks (for example, scholars are raising the problem of the digital data identity, digital identification in the context of online transactions). At the same time, the anthropological view of identity remains. It is found for instance in the context of narratives, texts of a person about self that are posted on the Internet. In this context, the concept of “Person Life View” (M. Schechtman) is presented as a variant of a person’s holistic view of the self. The analysis of domestic publications makes it possible to conclude that representatives of social sciences and humanities in their research strive to overcome the dynamic view of a person (dissolving of identity or an absent self), are in search of models of “stability” of identity. Conclusion. Posing the question about the personal identity of a modern person, it seems that the border between the directly human (consciousness and body, for example) and the technical and technological (the Internet and the objective world) is becoming more and more destabilized every day. This predetermines the direction of the research. Contemporary scholars, who publish the results of their work in journals included in scientific databases, are faced not only with the problem of substantiating human identity as a theoretical concept that reflects the modern situation, but also with the problem of finding models in which a person is able to embody the idea of “stability” of identity in the everyday life."

This study examined the perception of parents by an individual in the dimensions of warmth, involvement and autonomy support for father and mother and self-presentation in the dimensions of ability- and attempt-to-act among a sample of 142 participants (male (68) and female (74)), age ranging from 18 to 32 years. Results indicated that overall, warmth, involvement and autonomy support of both father and mother, respectively and ability- and attempt-to-act do contribute significantly for predicting Internet Addiction. However, specifically involvement of father correlates negatively to Internet addiction and warmth of father and attempt-to-act in self-presentation correlates positively to Internet Addiction."

Considerations for a cybernetics design thinking in the socialism of the XXI century \nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s00146-021-01354-2\n Leonardo Lavanderos \nFrom its origins, cybernetics has based its desire on the concept of transverse nature, today transdisciplinary. Within its history, the breaking point is unquestionably Stafford Beer and the VMS applied in Salvador Allende’s government. Chile’s historical conditions and context undoubtedly allowed a series of conceptual emergencies that were not necessarily developed after the 1973 coup d’état. Beer’s design, as he claims, could serve both a socialist vision and a fascist command. This tells us that the tool depends on the hand of the administrator. On the other hand, good but insufficient attempts have been made in the field of biologies, such as the theory of autopoiesis and epistemological positions concerning the observer, which have not been able to add value to the VMS. The errors in the design of the VMS can be summarized as follows: confusion of interactions with relationships, confusing co-autonomy with self-organization, confusion of centrism and centralities necessarily as central and establish isomorphisms in a mathematical system aiming at conceptual homologation. As is the case with Information and Entropy. This work shows that the VMS must obligatorily migrate to a Relational Viable system, whose bases are the relations of cooperation and reciprocity based on heterarchical structures for limited or scarce material energy resources. This is the basis of the socialist design which forces the economy to reduce the production of Non-Required Variety."

The conditions of the Covid-19 pandemic have caused parents and children to be in one place at the same time. This study aims to determine the effect of parental involvement and maternal employment status on the independence of children aged 7-8 years in the Covid-19 pandemic situation. This quantitative research uses a comparative causal ex-post facto design, with groups of working mothers and groups of non-working mothers. The sample of each group was 60 people who were randomly selected. The findings of the study with the calculation of the two-way ANOVA test obtained the value of Fo = 4.616> F table = 3.92 or with p-value = 0.034 <α = 0.05, indicating that there is an interaction between parental involvement and maternal employment status on children’s independence, and Based on the results of hypothesis testing, there is no effect of parental involvement and mother’s work status on the independence of the child even though there are differences in the average results of children’s independence.\n Keywords: Children’s Independence, Parental Involvement and Mothers’ Employment\n References:\n Areepattamannil, S., & Santos, I.

Information and communication technologies (ICTs) in health represent an innovation to promote home care and autonomy for people with various degrees of cognitive impairment. The objective of this study is to develop a web-based multicriteria decision support tool adapted to older adults with MCI or mNCD, their informal caregivers, and health care providers (HCPs) to support the development and implementation of ICTs adapted to the needs and preferences of people with cognitive impairments and their caregivers.We used a participatory research strategy to develop of a decision support tool for the use of ICTs focused on the needs of patients, their caregivers, and HCPs. Data collection consisted of semi-structured interviews with elderly people with MCI (N = 10) and caregivers of people with mNCD (N= 7) to explore their current knowledge and perceptions of various ICTs as well as their needs and preferences for such interventions and a focus group with HCPs to understand their perceptions of the needs of seniors with MCI and caregivers of people with mNCD.ICTs are seen as a beneficial solution to promote home care and autonomy for people with cognitive disorders. ICTs provide a sense of security and peace of mind, especially for caregivers of people with mNCD. However, the complexity and high cost of ICTs as well as the lack of support appear to be major limits to their use. HCP recognize the value of e-Health but claim to lack reliable information and were therefore highly unsure to recommend its use.People suffering from cognitive disorders and their caregivers are generally open to technological developments and favour the use of ICTs. For health professionals, continuous training on ICTs would make them more comfortable to recommend them to patients and their families. Although the use of ICTs is promising for maintaining elderly people with cognitive disorders at home, our study shows that it will be necessary to find ways to make them accessible to promote their use."

This study explores the mechanism influencing the use of ICT on students’ science literacy. We utilized two-level hierarchical linear models and structural equation models to analyze data collected from the 2015 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) in China. Results indicate that student-level and school-level ICT factors, in particular ICT interest, autonomy in using ICT, and ICT availability at school positively impact the development of students’ science literacy. Further, we found some notable interactions between school-level factors and student-level ICT variables. Moreover, there are structural relationships among ICT availability, ICT emotional perception, ICT learning usage behaviors, science self-efficacy, and science literacy. We also found that teacher-delivered science instruction has a negative moderating effect on ICT learning usage and science self-efficacy. These findings have important implications of how to integrate ICT in future science teaching practices."

Ormond \n Philip Menard \n Robert E. Crossler \nWith government and industry experiencing a critical shortage of trained cybersecurity professionals, organisations are spearheading various training programs to cultivate cybersecurity skills. With more people working from home and the existing cybersecurity staff shortages, cybercriminals are increasingly exploiting new and existing vulnerabilities by launching ubiquitous cyberattacks. This study focuses on how to close the gap in cybersecurity skills through interest cultivation and self-determined motivation. Our study shows that situational interest (SI) in cybersecurity along with situational motivational determinants (i.e., perceived learning autonomy and perceived relatedness) engendered self-determined motivation toward cybersecurity training. Consequently, self-determined motivation facilitated actual learning behaviour. Meanwhile, individual interest in cybersecurity created positive moderating effects in the relationships between self-determination and its key antecedents (i.e., perceived relatedness and situational interest). Based on these findings, we provide research implications accordingly."

Several sectors such as health, economy, and entertainment have benefitted from the digital traces left by users due to the tight interactions on digital platforms. Today, it is likely to determine and predict users’ moods, behavioral patterns, habits, and personality traits with the use of digital traces that are processed using artificial intelligence techniques. Such use of digital data offers new opportunities for mental health services. Today with this method, it is possible to obtain simultaneous data on the course of the psychological disorder and create a complete and more holistic picture of the disorder by accessing data that can not be obtained from self-report assessment techniques. This new approach, which is called digital phenotyping, can improve the objectivity in diagnosis. Studies have proven digital phenotyping’s potential to determine disorders’ recurrence risk and make psychometric predictions. The studies have indicated the promising future of digital phenotyping in mental health services since the initial discussions by Jain et al. in 2015. It is reported that digital phenotyping can be used to diagnose and follow certain mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia at an early stage. However, ethical concerns such as privacy, autonomy, data security, and data confidentiality are among the critical issues surrounding the use of digital phenotyping. This paper includes essential information about the digital phenotyping method, discussions about the practical, legal and ethical concerns regarding the use of digital phenotyping in mental health services, and suggestions for future research.

In this scenario, the use of Internet technology has grown as an option for the expansion of continuing education (CE), as it allows professionals to develop educational activities with flexibility, autonomy, and convenience. E-learning has gained popularity and currently, thousands of online courses are being offered. However, studies of e-learning in professional training have presented only a few specific foci of study.to develop a comprehensive approach to understand both the experience and the complex scenario of the use of e-learning in the CE for pharmacists.Field research in 10 Brazilian states through interviews and focus groups with alumni of a CE e-learning specialization course for pharmacists in public health. Data analysis used the model of socio-technical systems and was based on a framework with the components Objectives, People, Processes, Culture, Technology, Infrastructure, and Scenario.The People and Culture components indicated the assimilation and normalization of technologies in the educational process. Although the infrastructure (technical and organizational) was deficient in some regions, the Technology component suggested that the characteristics of the course design, associated with the personal characteristics of the students, provided ways to overcome obstacles. The objectives of the use of distance education seem to be related to the possibility of greater accessibility and autonomy. The Processes component, in turn, revealed the burden that a e-learning course puts on the pharmacist.E-learning proved to be useful to enable and expand access to education, providing pharmacists with an opportunity for CE. On the other hand, e-learning contributes to the normalization of the precarious working conditions of pharmacists, attributing to individuals the sole responsibility for the CE even in an institutional CE program, which results in work overload."

Designing teaching activity for digital learning and flexibly applying technology tools are the key issues for current information technology integrated education. Interactive learning modules could be used in the classroom environment for effective learning. This study explored the effect of instructional modules for providing supplementary instruction in biology concepts. Interactive digital learning module was developed in order to assist students in biology learning. Interactive activities were considered in this study, include teacher – student interaction, student - student interaction, student - content interaction, and student - technology interaction. 180 students of Grade 11 in 6 classes at SMAN 2 Balige were selected as the research subjects. Three groups of students participated in biology learning course, (2 classes) using different modules were interactive digital module, digital module and text module. Goal of this research was to determine the impact of interactive digital learning module on students’ learning activity and autonomy. Quantitative results obtained by using questionnaire to understand the student’s learning activity and autonomy. Results showed student’s activities and autonomy who learned with interactive digital learning modules significantly different with students who learned using text learning modules. The use of interactive features increased the activity and autonomy of learners and created the student-centered learning environment. Students under interactive multimedia instruction performed better than text module class. These findings suggested that learning activity and autonomy of students in biology could be enhanced by multimedia instruction.</p>"

The autonomous industry has seen a made large progress in the perception of environment as a result of the improvements done towards vision based systems. As the industry moves up the ladder of automation, safety features are coming more and more into the focus. Different safety measurements have to be taken into consideration based on different driving situations. One of the major concerns of the highest level of autonomy is to obtain the ability of understanding both internal and external situations. Most of the research made on vision based systems are focused on image processing and artificial intelligence systems like machine learning and deep learning. Due to the current generation of technology being the generation of “Connected World”, there is no lack of data any more. As a result of the introduction of internet of things, most of these connected devices are able to share and transfer data. Vision based techniques are techniques that are hugely depended on these vision based data."

John Morgan \nThe article considers what is a philosophy and its relation to education . The modern academic development of philosophy has questioned the theoretical basis of specific aspects of knowledge and human experience, including education. It is an active rather than a passive or descriptive discipline. Education is defined similarly as a process by which knowledge, skills (including collecting empirical evidence and reasoning from it), cultural norms, values, and beliefs are acquired. The development of the modern philosophy of education is considered with its emphasis on conceptual analysis. Education is philosophically the conscious development of maturity requiring capacity for both intellectual and economic autonomy. Issues in the contemporary philosophy of education are then considered, particularly the challenges of post-modernism and post-truth for a philosophy of education in an Internet world. It identifies the need for comparative philosophical perspectives other than Occidental ones and suggests philosophical anthropology and comparative education as potential guides. It concludes that although there is now no consensus on how a coherent contemporary philosophy of education may be developed, analysis of concepts, metaphysical reasoning, and ethics may still provide a basis for a coherent and defensible philosophy of education whatever the comparative cultural setting."

In searching for innovative options to create more autonomy and better quality of life in dementia care settings, repurposing existing structures, in particular vacant urban malls, may be one option for the large sites needed for the European model of dementia villages. These settings may become sustainable Dementia Friendly City Centers (DFCC), because in the case of enclosed mall construction, the internal infrastructure is in place for lighting, HVAC, with varied spatial configuration of public spaces. This presentation describes the community engagement research being conducted by a research team at a Midwestern university, laying groundwork for the DFCC model for centralized dementia programs, services and attached housing. An online community workshop was held with 50 participants from multiple stakeholder groups including architect, urban planners, landscape architects, memory care administrators, medical doctors, family caregivers, university professors and students and public health employees. 5 breakout sessions were held after the initiative was introduced to the participants with topics covered which included the themes of community revitalization, building sustainability, urban regreening, onsite housing and medical care and innovation and culture change in dementia care This presentation provides the qualitative data collected through the recorded breakout sessions and the participants agreed that the DFCC model is one opportunity to make life better not only for those with needs associated with dementia now, but also for ourselves in the future. Others saw education of future stakeholders about the value of this model of care as critical in transforming current hurdles into future opportunities."

The research is based on the data from expenditure commitments registries in 2019. A major share of budget expenditures is “compulsory” (pre-determined) expenditures, which have limited flexibility and cannot be redirected to different purposes. Under these circumstances, the ability of regional governments to vary the direction of budget spending and finance self-initiated expenditure commitments—in other words, to independently manage the composition of expenditures—is kept to a minimum, which implies low autonomy in managing expenditures. Most of the Russian Far Eastern regions’ government expenditures are aimed at supporting the current volume and quality of public services. The share of developmental expenditures is higher in regions having more budget resources (Sakhalin Oblast), and significantly lower in regions of the northern Far East (Magadan Oblast, Kamchatka Krai, and Sakha Republic (Yakutia)), the latter having higher costs of supporting critical infrastructure under severe climate conditions. In the present situation, regional governments cannot be fully considered as key influencers managing the development of their territories, and only fill the role of executors and lobbying actors for acquiring financial support from the federal government. As a result, it is difficult to account for specific territorial circumstances and development potential, and the overall efficiency of government spending is decreased. In the authors’ opinion, the findings may be applicable to most regions in the Russian Federation."

Sunday \n Ganiu A. Bamgbose \nStudies on humour in Nigeria have been extensively carried out from the perspectives of stand-up comedy and computer-mediated communication. There is a dearth of scholarly enquiries on humour in situation comedies (sitcoms). This paper investigates humour in the interactions of characters in Jenifa’s Diary and Professor JohnBull, with a view to accounting for the manifestations of humour, the humour strategies deployed and the functions that the humorous utterances serve in the sitcoms. The work is situated in Culpeper’s Impoliteness Theory. Eight excerpts from the sitcoms were subjected to pragmatic analysis. Two discourse functions of amusing and castigating are discovered in the data. The former serves the function of facilitating discourse and changing presumed power and status, while the latter serves the function of maintaining one’s own space and autonomy, and demanding respect. Allusion, parody, retort, tease, banter and putdown are the humour techniques employed in the sitcoms. The study corroborates the claim of earlier studies that humour in every sphere of language use serves certain functions beyond the interactional need to create amusement."

Digital technologies have become necessary for people of all ages to perform daily activities, increasingly including older people. The use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and virtual tools can provide older people with excellent opportunities to connect with other generations, improving their quality of life and well-being. The aim of this study was to examine the benefits, satisfaction, and limitations of intergenerational interactions generated by the use of virtual tools. The participants are subjects of any age and different social groups residing in Spain and have completed an online survey. The analysis of sociodemographic data of the respondents showed that there is a significant correlation between the use of social networks and all the variables analyzed, except for their level of autonomy. Most participants who participated in intergenerational virtual activities reported the benefits of their social participation, relationships, mood, mental health, and academic education. Moreover, most participants were quite or very satisfied with the person with whom they used the virtual tools, especially if the person was a friend, their partner, sibling, another relative, or colleague. Except for grandparents, people who participated in intergenerational virtual activities and who had no limitations or disabilities were more frequently reported by the participants. In conclusion, intergenerational interactions through the use of virtual tools can contribute to improving the social inclusion and relationships of all people involved."

Belonogov \nThis article is part of the extensive research of value characteristics of IT community and their potential for innovative development. In view of this, the author examines the problem of determination of the modern cultural situation and, as a result, deduction of the criterion that establishes what &ldquo;modern&rdquo; is. Based on the previously acquired conclusions (according to which, such criterion is the consideration of irreducible multiplicity, and the major risk is the loss of autonomy by individuals), the author aims to find the model of subjectivity that would be simultaneously multiple and autonomous. The search for the model that meets such criterion is carried out through referring to the control technologies developed within the framework of third-order cybernetics. The novelty of this article consists in peculiarity of the approach towards solution of the set task: the question in the form and method of determination of modernity has been first raised and&nbsp; solved within the framework of the Russian academic philosophical community at&nbsp; the previous stage of research, which determines the relevance at the current stage as well. Comparison of the developments of Russian and foreign authors reveals the parallelism between the development of cybernetics and psychoanalysis; demonstrates the conceptual intersections of the third-order cybernetics and schizoanalysis; establishes the conformity between the subjectivity of the individual and the type of organizations they are engaged in. The article offers the concept of &ldquo;dividual&rdquo; as a model suitable for solution of the set task. The conclusions is made that the existing potential of the IT community for modernization is neutralized in the context of transition towards the hierarchical structure of the organization."

In this sense, Industry 4.0 technologies offer significant opportunities for improving both operational and decision-making processes. These developments make it possible to consider an increase in the level of operational systems and teams’ autonomy. However, the potential for strengthening the decision-making process by means of these new technologies remains unclear in the current literature. To fill this gap, a Delphi study using the Régnier Abacus technique was conducted with a representative panel of 24 experts. The novelty of this study was to identify and characterize the potential for enhancing the overall decision-making process with the main Industry 4.0 groups of technologies. Our results show that cloud computing appears as a backbone to enhance the entire decision-making process. However, certain technologies, such as IoT and simulation, have a strong potential for only specific steps within the decision-making process. This research also provides a first vision of the manager’s perspectives, expectations, and risks associated with implementing new modes of decision-making and cyber-autonomy supported by Industry 4.0 technologies."

Notably, the permanent nature of mobile data has aided its path between individuals and the police, storing integral evidence for criminal investigations in the palms of peoples’ hands. Understanding cognitive factors that predict when an individual would choose to report mobile data to the police is pertinent, particularly in a time of heightened controversy over data access limits and ubiquitous surveillance. This study extends Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) through incorporating the watchful eye effect and the theory of contextual integrity to analyze predictors of intention to share data with the police. The results of a 2 (Situational severity: high or low) x 2 (Surveillance: present or absent) between-subjects factorial vignette methodology ( N = 222) revealed that participants behaved independently of feeling watched, but that such sharing can be causally attributed to situational severity. Further, we found PMT variables—including perceived severity, response-efficacy, self-efficacy, and response cost—as well as perception of the police to serve as predictors of intentions to share with the police, with some of these factors mediating the effects of situational severity and surveillance. This study not only provides a theoretical contribution to PMT but also practical recommendations for mobile design that considers surveillance normalization and prioritizes data autonomy. • High situational severity crimes causes a high intention to share data with police. • Individuals act independently of surveillance when sharing data with the police. • Results on PMT predictor variables align with that of previous literature. • PMT predictor variables mediate environmental factors and behavioral intention. • Perception of the police acts as a predictor of intention to share data with them."

IoT has penetrated in the health field by facilitating healthcare exchanger for users and professionals. This article aims to examine several factors reinforcing user engagement. A theoretical framework was developed and includes the perceived autonomy, the desire for self-development, and the user trust to predict IoT user engagement in the medical context. The partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) approach was conducted with a sample of 109 French users. The findings highlight the relationship between trust and engagement in the use of the IoT device to improve health behavior. This research is part of a long-term IoT customer/designer relationship based on interaction and trust. It can enable IoT providers, medical professionals, and marketers to optimize patient communication to target potential users more accurately and reduce user abandonment of devices."

It is concerned with questions of a just and free distribution of information, with questions of autonomy and power on the internet or a value-oriented design of Information Technology (IT) systems. Information technologies shape many of the essential factors of interaction in a data-driven society. The implementation of values such as privacy, freedom from discrimination or participation in the development of a digital society is therefore a necessary prerequisite for a democratic and sustainable course of action. Digital information technologies make it possible to disseminate information in two ways: via the users, and about the users. Increasingly, information about the behavior and the communication of users can be collected through digital platforms. The vast amount of economically used data and also the exchange of information on social media platforms calls for evaluation, orientation and governance. Only in this way can we ensure that freedom of information is not a privilege, but a shared resource in a lively pluralistic and democratic society."

The present study aims to further explore the direct effects of parent-adolescent and peer relationships on adolescent MPA as well as the indirect effects through the mediating roles of autonomy, competence, and relatedness needs satisfaction.Our sample consisted of 1766 Chinese adolescents (53.10% male; Mage = 13.33, SD = 1.94, range from 10 to 18 years) who completed questionnaires regarding parent-adolescent relationships, peer relationships, psychological needs satisfaction, and MPA. SPSS 24.0 was used to analyze correlations among variables and Mplus 7.4 was used to test the structural equation model in this study.(1) positive parent-adolescent relationships were negatively associated with adolescent MPA, while peer relationships did not show a significant association with MPA; (2) autonomy and competence needs satisfaction significantly mediated the effects of parent-adolescent and peer relationships on MPA, while the mediating role of relatedness need satisfaction between parent-adolescent and peer relationships and MPA was not significant; (3) the mediating effect of competence need satisfaction between peer relationships and MPA was significantly stronger than that between parent-adolescent relationships and MPA.This study explored the different mechanisms by which parent-adolescent and peer relationships influence adolescent MPA. These discoveries may contribute to intervention and prevention programs for adolescent MPA."

Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications enable users, machines, and technologically enriched objects (‘Things’) to sense, communicate, and interact with their environment. Albeit making human beings’ lives more comfortable, these systems collect huge quantities of data that may affect human privacy and their digital sovereignty. Engaging in control over individuals by digital means, the data and the artefacts that process privacy-relevant data can be addressed by Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and its established instruments. In this paper, we discuss how the theory and its methodological knowledge can be considered for user-centric privacy management. We set the stage for studying motivational factors to improve user engagement in identifying privacy needs and preserving privacy when utilizing or aiming to adapt CPS or IoT applications according to their privacy needs. SDT considers user autonomy, self-perceived competence, and social relatedness relevant for human engagement. Embodying these factors into a Design Science-based CPS development framework could help to motivate users to articulate privacy needs and adopt cyber-physical technologies for personal task accomplishment."

Emerging adults ( N = 328) reported their frequency of communication in person, over the phone, via text message, and on social networking sites with mother, father, and closest friend. A Latent Profile Analysis revealed four communication patterns (Low communication, Friend-oriented, Parent-oriented, and Multimedia). Communication patterns with mothers and fathers were similar; youth used more text messaging and social networking with friends. A Friend-oriented communication pattern was associated with psychological well-being while the Multimedia group reported higher social well-being."

An empirical study of China’s Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces \nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.giq.2022.101676\n Wenshan Guo \n Tao Chen \n Qiangqiang Luo \nIn light of the accelerated growth of an aging population , coupled with the massive diffusion of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), research on whether ICTs meet the needs of elderly users is important and timely. Despite the popularity of self-determination theory, few studies have adopted this theoretical framework to explain need satisfaction among this group. The continuous use of mobile government (m-government) relies on the satisfaction of citizens’ needs. Through the theoretical lens of self-determination theory, we developed a research model of m-government for elders’ intrinsic need satisfaction. In this model, the design factors, performance factors, and individuals’ ability factors are incorporated. Based on data from 366 m-government-for-elders users in China’s Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces, and through the use of structural equation modeling, the results show that complexity has a negative correlation with autonomy need satisfaction and competence need satisfaction. Visual appeal positively affects all dimensions of intrinsic need satisfaction. Information quality has a positive relationship with relatedness need satisfaction. The effects of personalization on relatedness need satisfaction and the influence of personalization on competence need satisfaction were significant. Information literacy moderates the relationship between complexity and autonomy need satisfaction, as well as between complexity and competence need satisfaction. The findings of this article enrich existing m-government research and provide practical implications for policymakers and m-government developers in China. • The three basic intrinsic needs of seniors users are met by using m-government for elders. • Visual appeal of devices is the most salient driving factor of intrinsic need satisfaction. • We examine the moderating effect of information literacy. • The antecedents of three kinds of intrinsic need satisfaction are different."

This study applied qualitative research methods while the data were collected through observation, in-depth interviews, and documentation. The research subjects consisted of 4 hijra community founders and 10 teenage members of 3 hijra communities in Langsa. These communities include Komunitas Generasi Rabbani (KGR), the Akhwat Ilmu Agama (AKHIA) and the Muslimah Aceh Fillah (MAF). This research integrated Michael Foucault’s theory of power and knowledge and Jurgen Habermas’s theory of public space. The findings of this study indicated that the phenomenon of hijra among them has implications for changes in the Islamic landscape. It was triggered by the rapid development of information technology, such as the use of the internet through social media and content production on various digital platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. The impact of this phenomenon fosters the autonomy of the millennials to find their interpretations and choose new religious patrons that can be accessed easily through various existing digital platforms. The emergence of these new religious patrons does not come from traditional religious institutions like dayah. Such Islamic expression will expose young Muslims to pop culture and information technology in the future."

However, little is known about how mothers with incomes below the poverty threshold and with education levels of high school or less use and interact with the Internet as a key source of lay knowledge and skills for infant care and childrearing. Our objective in this study was to understand mothers’ perceptions of their experience in using online information for these purposes. To obtain a rich and nuanced understanding of their experience, we used a qualitative study approach based on 40 individual semi-structured interviews with mothers. Adopting Freidson’s concept of “lay referral system” to grasp mothers’ experience with online parenting information, we found that they relied on this information source extensively. Our findings showed that Internet-based information and online interactions were part of their lay referral system and modified to some extent how they interacted with their lay consultants (family and friends). Three major themes emerged in relation to how the Internet functioned as a component of the mothers’ lay referral systems: (1) strategic use of the Internet for better parenting; (2) critical stance towards the Internet; and (3) strengthening of autonomy, skills, and self-confidence. Mothers with spouses and an active social network were more likely to use online information to complement information obtained from their entourage or from professionals than were mothers with a less active social network or who were more socially isolated."

Does this wonder shed light upon our view of the basic roots of cultural, social and political blooming? This paper intends to adduce evidence on second-order cybernetics processes underlying five outstanding cases in real societies and to disclose the links between democracy and unfettering momentum for freedom and creativity. Namely, Oscar Varsavsky, national projects, styles of development, scientific and technological autonomy; Stefano Varese, cultural and political autonomy of indigenous people; Mario Pedrosa, creation of the Museum of Solidarity in Chile; Stafford Beer, Cybersyn project for cybernetics and self-management in Chile; and Humberto Maturana, concepts of autopoiesis, cognition, language and multiverse. The reasoning counts with the author’s direct participation in all cases. The paper sets a similarity worthy of being noticed between Allende’s Unidad Popular in Chile and Pericles’ Golden Age in Greece and outlines why these historic realms albeit far apart have lasting importance and similar historical impetus. Highlights the essential and seminal features of each stream and comes to the conclusion that effective democracy is the necessary condition for participation and creativity. Upsurges in social participation and creativity are neither frequent nor cyclical. Still, such sudden and usually large increase in ingenuity, flair and aim to improve living conditions, although limited in time, remain in our mind as a joy forever. Nowadays, the world witnesses a contrary motion towards sterile art patterns and restrained behaviour. Hence, it becomes even more important to better understand the basic roots of cultural, social and political blooming."

The West is currently struggling to balance the use of data for commercial purposes with the social good stemming from the protection of personal privacy and dignity. It is also grappling with the idea of machines having autonomous capabilities that human minds alone were supposed to monopolize. East Asia, with its tradition of Confucianism, Buddhism, and animism, has long emphasized the virtue of mutual benevolence as well as conviviality with nature, both of which may be contrasted with the Western emphasis on the autonomy of individuals and the supremacy of humans over nature. We need to revisit such foundational schools of thought in view of such factors as network externalities of data, extremely low marginal cost of digital services, and high level of traceability, all of which are altering the historical prerequisites of the modern market economy. In the face of the emergence of a new civilization, we need to find a guiding philosophy which allows us to develop policies that adequately benefit all people. There are notions such as integrity (fiduciary responsibility) that East and West share and that may be adopted to build broadly acceptable governance principles."

Past studies focused on the relationships between students’ frequency of ICT use and reading performance but neglected the possible interrelationships between students’ ICT-related psychological factors, school contextual factors, and reading performance. This study applied the Self-determination Theory (SDT) to explore the relationships between students’ ICT-related psychological factors (perceived interest, autonomy, competence, and social interaction in using ICT) and reading performance. The possible moderation effects of schools’ contextual variables (schools’ support in ICT devices and schools’ support in teachers’ capacity to integrate technology in teaching) were also investigated. Data from 222,293 secondary students from 10,103 schools in 47 economies who participated in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018 were analyzed using three-level hierarchical linear modeling. The results provided support for the SDT by confirming the positive correlations between students’ ICT-related interest, autonomy and competence and reading performance, and the accentuating moderation effect of schools’ contextual factors. However, students’ perceived social interaction in ICT use was negatively correlated with reading performance, and this negative correlation worsened with increasing schools’ support in ICT devices while buffered with increasing schools’ support in teachers’ capacity to use technology."

The current work explores six dimensions of parenting (warmth, structure, autonomy support, rejection, chaos, and coercion), and their specific relationship to school and online bullying. Using survey data from a nationally representative sample of 1474 English-speaking 12- to 17-year-old US youth, we found that students whose parent(s) exhibit warmth, structure, and autonomy support are less likely to have engaged in bullying or cyberbullying offending, while those with parental relations marked by rejection, chaos, and coercion are more likely to have participated in both forms of peer aggression. Implications for developing stronger parent-child relationships through improved parenting practices as a mechanism for bullying prevention are discussed."

There are a number of technologies, specific military applications and solutions such as the Internet, GPS or sunglasses, and methodologies like strategic planning and negotiation systems that were developed in the past within military domains and later evaluated and implemented, which brought increases in speed and added business value. There are now many diverse digital transformation projects being implemented in several business domains – ranging from small and medium businesses like an Italian family restaurant to the global oil and gas companies such as Shell or British Petroleum or even executive branches of the European Union/European Commission. All these organisations use different technologies to optimise processes, innovate faster, collaborate efficiently and deliver more value with less effort. Economic defence – like never before – means national security. For that reason, Cyber Security initiatives associated with digital transformations include a “testing mode” period, along with Cyber Autonomy functions that aim to support business critical infrastructures. Different methodologies are in place to optimise for the new data-driven economy and support digital transformation. It is the responsibility of the business to adopt best practices and techniques to reinforce national security and offer effective tool support for effective Cyber Autonomy with digital transformation projects."

    "text": "Doc 1579 :  A global study on job and career satisfaction of early-career pharmacists and pharmaceutical scientists \nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcsop.2022.100110\n Sherly Meilianti \n Ayodeji Matuluko \n Nazifa Ibrahim \n Nilhan Uzman \n Ian Bates \nJob and career satisfaction of early-career pharmacists and pharmaceutical scientists is imperative to ensure a motivated and effective workforce, and a secure future for pharmacy practice. In turn, this enables planning, deployment and long term implementation of global imperatives, through universal pharmacy coverage. This study used data from a global survey to determine the level of job and career satisfaction and identify factors that are most significant in determining satisfaction in early-career professionals. A cross-sectional survey was distributed to members of the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) Young Pharmacists Group (YPG) via email and social media platforms from November 2019 to May 2020. A previously validated questionnaire using 5-point Likert scales was used. Data were analysed by exploratory factor analysis, using principal component analysis, oblique rotation, and reliability testing of identified components, followed by a comparative statistical analysis. A total of 1014 respondents from 92 countries participated in this study. Regions of domicile significantly affected job satisfaction ( p = 0.004) and career satisfaction ( p < 0.0001) scores. Pharmacists working in community pharmacies perceived lower job satisfaction measures compared to those who work in academic institutions ( p < 0.0001) and industry sector ( p = 0.012). There is a negative association between career expectations and job satisfaction and career satisfaction scores. The workplace climate is related to education and training opportunities, lower reported workloads, greater autonomy, and more remuneration. This was an international study of early-career pharmacists and pharmaceutical scientists. Enhancing factors associated with job and career satisfaction is essential to support early-career pharmacists and pharmaceutical scientists in obtaining fulfilment and esteem in their chosen careers. Developing and implementing a well-framed system that provides a conducive working environment, remuneration, and greater autonomy could improve job and career satisfaction. This study provides evidence to support investment in early-career training, stated in the FIP Development Goal 2."

Drones, Autonomous Weapon Systems (AWS), and Cyberwarfare instruments have been resorted to by states and non-state actors in warfare. Yet, the developments and emerging challenges have not resulted in formal amendments to the existing regulatory framework of International law. Some believe that the current regime is required to be amended in accordance with developing technologies. Others support the idea that the rules and principles of the existing International Humanitarian Law regime need to be re-evaluated and re-interpreted according to changing conditions on the ground that a formal amendment process does not seem to be a feasible option because of the resistance of the powerful international actors. At this point, formidable questions arise such as; What are the challenges to interpreting existing rules and standards of the IHL regime amidst the increasing developing technologies? What levels of autonomy will be permissible for AWS to ensure compliance with international law principles, i.e., the principle of distinction in warfare? Which technologies or certain weapons can/should be restricted and outlawed? This article aims to come up with satisfying answers to these and further questions."

Today, RC possesses a solid skill base and an expansive depth of knowledge, enabling them to provide safe, team-based, evidence-based effective care for patients. This study explores perceptions of RC students (RCS), RC faculty (RCF), and RC professionals (RCP) regarding Interprofessional Education (IPE) and Interprofessional Practice (IPP). Additionally, it identifies factors that affect perceptions of knowledge, skills, and abilities related to IPE and IPP among RCS, RCF, and RCP.\n Methods: A mixed method (embedded) design was used. An online email survey questionnaire was emailed to the program directors to distribute it among their students, alumni, and faculty. The total of 421 program directors were reached via email. Three hundred forty-five surveys were returned, with 208 surveys eligible for analysis.\n Results: The findings showed a significant main effect of professional status on the Interdisciplinary Education Perception Scale (IEPS) overall score regardless of the IPE exposure. However, there was no significant difference in the average score on the competency and autonomy, perceived need for cooperation, or perception of actual cooperation. Qualitatively, it was revealed that simulation was the most useful IPE experience for promoting IPP. Additional factors such as time, attitude, experiences, cooperation, and cost were believed to affect the infusion of IPE into the academic environment.\n Conclusion: Regardless of the status of RCS and RCPs exposure to IPE during their professional education, all perceived IPE as positively supporting IPP. Qualitatively, for those directly exposed to IPE, simulation was identified as the most useful IPE experience for promoting IPP.\n Recommendations: IPE should be continued implemented as a strategy for the promotion of IPP, as well as the necessity for further documentation and assessment of the IPE techniques used in the academy to guarantee learning outcome accountability."

These ranges provide a platform for conducting cybersecurity exercises; however, conducting such exercises is a complex process because they involve people with different skill sets for the scenario modeling, infrastructure preparation, dry run, execution, and evaluation. This process is very complex and inefficient in terms of time and resources. Moreover, the exercise infrastructure created in current cyber ranges does not reflect the dynamic environment of real-world systems and does not provide adaptability for changing requirements. To tackle these issues, we developed a system that can automate many tasks of the cybersecurity exercise life cycle. We used model-driven approaches to (1) model the roles of the different teams present in the cybersecurity exercises and (2) generate automation artifacts to execute their functions efficiently in an autonomous manner. By executing different team roles such as attackers and defenders, we can add friction in the environment, making it dynamic and realistic. We conducted case studies in the form of operational cybersecurity exercises involving national-level cybersecurity competitions and a university class setting in Norway to evaluate our developed system for its efficiency, adaptability, autonomy, and skill improvement of the exercise participants. In the right conditions, our proposed system could create a complex cybersecurity exercise infrastructure involving 400 nodes with customized vulnerabilities, emulated attackers, defenders, and traffic generators under 40 minutes. It provided a realistic environment for cybersecurity exercises and positively affected the exercise participants’ skill sets."

According to that, learners need to study in their own space and make them more independent and autonomous. However, learners tend to experience difficulties caused by their surrounding environments that sometimes does not support online learning. Surrounding environments include human activities e.g., noise in the surrounding; financial capabilities of parents for internet data plans; or other issues beyond the student’s intellectual abilities. Therefore, this research aimed to explore the existed environmental factors that affected the learning environment and define the factors which affected learners’ volition. This study was applied a qualitative method and presenting the collected results descriptively. The researcher worked with one English teacher who has been voluntarily participating in this study. This study used semi-structured interview and questionnaire as the research instruments. Firstly, the researcher sent the questionnaires using Google Form for all students at 11th graders from one of the government-owned senior high schools in Surabaya. Secondly, the researcher interviewed an English teacher to find out the class’ conditions. This study has revealed that teacher still holds huge responsibilities to guide students along the online learning process. Besides, there were still a lacks IT skills of students which make the teacher not only a facilitator but also a helper or counsellor. This dominant role of the teacher eventually made students less autonomous."

Nathan Matias \nThe lack of consent or debriefing in online research has attracted widespread public distrust. How can designers create systems to earn and maintain public trust in large-scale online research? Procedural theories inform processes that enable individuals to make decisions about their participation. Substantive theories focus on the normative judgments that researchers and participants make about specific studies in context. Informed by these theories, we designed Bartleby, a system for debriefing participants and eliciting their views about studies that involved them. We evaluated this system by using it to debrief thousands of participants in a series of observational and experimental studies on Twitter and Reddit. We find that Bartleby addresses procedural concerns by creating new opportunities for study participants to exercise autonomy. We also find that participants use Bartleby to contribute to substantive, value-driven conversations about participant voice and power. We conclude with a critical reflection on the strengths and limitations of reusable software to satisfy values from both procedural and substantive ethical theories."

Thus, this research is intended to provide data on teachers’ readiness and challenges in promoting learner autonomy during online learning activities. This research employed quantitative and qualitative data collection. The quantitative data were gained by a survey that has been conducted to 38 English teachers in 38 junior high schools in Bengkulu. In addition, the qualitative data were collected from an interview that has also been carried out to six teachers. The quantitative data obtained were then analysed through descriptive statistics analysis in the form of percentages and frequency. Meanwhile, the qualitative data were analysed by using thematic analysis. The results showed that in general most teachers were ready to build learner autonomy in ICT-based English learning. Most teachers used various methods in online teaching, gave freedom for the students to access different online resources according to their interest, found it easy to carry out online learning, yet most of them did not prefer to implement online learning activities. In the implementation, some challenges were faced by teachers, including poor internet connection, students’ different characteristics, and lack support from school policymakers."

This study examines the effects of salespeople’s social media and customer relationship management (CRM) technology use on value co-creation through knowledge and the downstream impact on sales performance. Based on task-technology fit and self-determination theories, the findings reveal that social media, CRM technology, and their interaction support salespeople in their value co-creation efforts through the mediating role of knowledge enriched by these tools. The results indicate a significant moderating effect of salesperson job autonomy and sales quota ease in enhancing the relationship between knowledge and value co-creation. The study concludes by discussing important implications that stem from our analyses."

Rural universities were disproportionately affected because of limited Internet access. The purpose of this study was to investigate the psychological need satisfaction/frustration and mental health among rural college students during this pandemic.Six hundred ninety-eight students (Mage = 22.15 ± 2.55) at a rural South-eastern university were recruited.Participants completed a survey examining stress, anxiety, need satisfaction/frustration and previous experience with online courses.Anxiety, autonomy and competence frustration were found to predict 60% of the variance of stress. Another regression analysis found stress, autonomy, competence, and relatedness frustration to predict 70% of the anxiety variance.Students are frustrated due to the lack of control and restrictions affecting their social interaction. Understanding the relationship between need satisfaction/frustration and mental health can aid university administration in developing interventions that address rural students’ needs."

The purpose of this paper is to analyze teachers’ perceptions with respect to their leadership abilities. Email interviews were conducted with nine teachers from two primary and two secondary schools to obtain their views regarding teacher leadership, whilst affording them opportunities to make suggestions for collaborative teacher leadership development. Having employed a phenomenological approach and thematic analysis as method, this paper proposes a collaborative teacher leadership development framework (CTLDF). Significant about the CTLDF is that teacher leaders should consider ausgang as a way of opening the door for collaboration, homo economicus as a collaborative act and parrhesia as autonomy towards collaborative teacher leadership. The findings reveal that teacher leaders should cultivate a readiness to create opportunities for collaborative leadership development. The study recommends that teacher leaders should first have to be cognizant about their own individual strengths, whilst slowly starting initiatives to collaborate in order to sustain improvements in teacher leadership practices."

A total of 287 (102 female and 185 male) Chinese university students reported on their perceived parenting styles, psychological needs, and behavior regulation. Results showed that basic psychological need satisfaction was positively associated with parental autonomy support and autonomous regulation of learning; need frustration was positively correlated with parental psychological control and dysregulation in social media engagement. More importantly, psychological need frustration was a mediator of the relation between parental psychological control and dysregulation in social media engagement. Our findings suggest that students living in an autonomy-supportive familial environment tend to have satisfied psychological needs as well as autonomous learning behavior. Impairment of psychological needs could be one of the mechanisms through which psychologically controlling parenting was linked to dysregulation of social media use in Chinese culture."

Some of this content is designed to be deliberately deceptive and manipulative. However, it is interspersed amongst other content from friends and family, advertising, and legitimate news. Filtering content violates key societal values of freedom of expression and inquiry. Taking no action, though, leaves users at the mercy of individuals and groups who seek to use both single articles and complex patterns of content to manipulate how Americans consume, act, work, and even think. Warning labels, which do not block content but instead aid the user in making informed consumption decisions, have been proposed as a potential solution to this dilemma. Ideally, they would respect the autonomy of users to determine what media they consume while combating intentional deception and manipulation through its identification to the user. This paper considers the perception of Americans regarding the use of warning labels to alert users to potentially deceptive content. It presents the results of a population representative national study and analysis of perceptions in terms of key demographics."

Yet, experimental studies investigating the results of different treatments between additional MALL and standard MALL implementations in Indonesian university context are still understudied. This research sought to investigate the extent to which additional MALL activities as a treatment to an EFL experimental group of university students could improve their English given the limited class time and large sized classes. The subjects of this study were two second semester classes of English Literature students. The experimental class, a low-performing group, was asked to watch a youtube video twice or thrice a week in addition to the standard online learning during the Covid-19 pandemic while the controlled class, a better performing group, was not given this treatment. The findings revealed that (1) experimental students significantly improved their pronunciation, intonation, vocabulary and fluency but not their formal assessment results; (2) though assigned additional MALL activities, the experimental group, due to limited financial ability for internet, spent roughly as much time as the controlled group; ((3) bad internet connection and low economic affordability contributed significantly to the less satisfactory result of MALL; (4) due to the standard online learning during the pandemic, both experimental and controlled students experienced increased exposures, enthusiasm, motivation, range of independent activites, autonomy and English ability; (5) real time students’ collaboration is challenging. This study suggests that MALL somehow allows greater English improvement and autonomy development and therefore is recommended that universities and respective local governments especially in remote areas provide the necessary supports."

A total of 1054 Chinese undergraduate students (M age = 20.35, SD = 1.00, 34.7% females) aged between 16 and 24 years participated in this study. They were instructed to complete self-reported questionnaires on parental autonomy support, filial piety, gratitude, and PIU. The results showed that parental autonomy support was negatively associated with PIU, and filial piety partially mediated this relation. Specifically, parental autonomy support was positively related to filial piety, which, in turn, was negatively associated with PIU. In addition, gratitude moderated the first path of the indirect relation and the direct relation of this mediation effect. To be specific, undergraduate students with higher gratitude showed high filial piety and low PIU, in the context of low parental autonomy support, than those with lower gratitude. Taken together, the current study contributes to extant research by highlighting the vital role of parental autonomy support in mitigating undergraduate students’ PIU and illustrating how filial piety explains the underlying mechanism of this association. This study also provides novel insights into intervention or prevention programs by demonstrating that gratitude alleviates the adverse effect of low parental autonomy support on students’ PIU."

However, there have been few review studies investigating how teachers implement this activity, how they use technology for the implementation, and what challenges they have. To better prepare practitioners to use digital tools for collaborative writing among their students, we reviewed 42 relevant studies focusing on their implementation identifying nine main TECW practices. These include: receiving teacher training; grouping students; training students on collaboration; training students on technology; providing students with new knowledge of writing; monitoring processes and giving immediate help; providing sufficient autonomy to students; evaluating outcomes and giving feedback; and encouraging students’ reflection. Technology could support TECW implementation by expediting information delivery, developing group workspaces and group chatrooms, recording students’ writing and collaboration behaviours and visualising their thoughts, enabling teacher commentary and information post, and presenting organised, analysed records of the TECW process. Challenges to TECW included: students’ reluctance to collaborate and difficulties using new technology. Based on the review, we argue that teachers can influence the implementation of TECW from cognitive, metacognitive, behavioural, and motivational aspects. Teacher training, student autonomy, and the size of writing groups are potential areas for future research in TECW."

    "text": "Doc 1594 :  Assessment of Cybersecurity Risks: Maritime Automated Piloting Process \nhttps://doi.org/10.34190/iccws.17.1.18\n Jouni Pöyhönen \n Martti Lehto \nA modern society is a combination of several critical infrastructures, of which international and national maritime transportation systems are essential parts. Digitalization makes it possible to increase levels of autonomy in maritime systems. It also means fully existing cyberenvironments in maritime processes. In cyberenvironments, it is crucial there is trustable information communication between system elements of the process, alongside the usability, reliability, and integrity of systems data in the operating environment. In order to develop maritime autonomy in Finland the Sea4Value / Fairway (S4VF) research program has been developed. At the first stage of the program, the main goal is to create automated fairway piloting feature in the near future. An automated remote piloting process, “ePilotage,” will be a complex system of systems entity. This paper provides a research approach to investigating the cybersecurity risks at the system levels of process. It emphasizes the importation of comprehensive risk assessment to increase the cybersecurity of fairway operations. The findings of the study are located in cybersecurity risks in critical information flows between the main system blocks of the fairway process. The research question is “How can the cybersecurity risks of automated remote fairway operations be evaluated?” The main findings are related to the probabilities of the risks in all levels of process stakeholders’ responsibilities. Risk assessment methodology, that has been described, is based on attack probabilities against probabilities to defend actions of adversarial in use of communication technologies. Risks assessment factors have been identified and the risk assessment tool have been proposed."

However, sometimes discussions can become fragmented because of the different levels of governance (Schmitt in AI Ethics 1–12, 2021) or because of different values, stakeholders, and actors involved (Ryan and Stahl in J Inf Commun Ethics Soc 19:61–86, 2021). Recently, these conflicts became very visible, with such examples as the dismissal of AI ethics researcher Dr. Timnit Gebru from Google and the resignation of whistle-blower Frances Haugen from Facebook. Underpinning each debacle was a conflict between the organisation’s economic and business interests and the morals of their employees. This paper will examine tensions between the ethics of AI organisations and the values of their employees, by providing an exploration of the AI ethics literature in this area, and a qualitative analysis of three workshops with AI developers and practitioners. Common ethical and social tensions (such as power asymmetries, mistrust, societal risks, harms, and lack of transparency) will be discussed, along with proposals on how to avoid or reduce these conflicts in practice (e.g., building trust, fair allocation of responsibility, protecting employees’ autonomy, and encouraging ethical training and practice). Altogether, we suggest the following steps to help reduce ethical issues within AI organisations: improved and diverse ethics education and training within businesses; internal and external ethics auditing; the establishment of AI ethics ombudsmen, AI ethics review committees and an AI ethics watchdog; as well as access to trustworthy AI ethics whistle-blower organisations."

Improve the institutionalized channels of mass participation in grass-roots social governance. We will improve the urban and rural grass-roots governance system that combines autonomy, rule of law and rule of virtue under the leadership of party organizations, improve the community management and service mechanism, implement grid management and service, give play to the role of mass organizations and social organizations, give play to the self-discipline function of trade associations and chambers of commerce, realize the benign interaction between government governance and social regulation, and residents’ autonomy, and consolidate the foundation of grass-roots social governance. Accelerate the modernization of urban social governance. Promote social governance and service focus to the grassroots level, sink more resources to the grassroots level, and better provide accurate and refined services. Specifically, the requirements for the construction of governance system can be analyzed into four requirements: intelligent governance, participatory governance, municipal governance and media governance."

A self-developed questionnaire was used to explore some aspects of learner autonomy relying on the action-oriented dimensions of Tassinari’s (2015) dynamic model of learner autonomy. The present paper aimed to investigate how university students in Hungary regulated their learning processes during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020 with regards to three Information and Communication Technology (ICT)-based teaching modes. Based on a quantitative study of the constructs of goal setting, management of the learning process and monitoring of efficiency, the researchers examine to what extent students were capable of adapting, through the exercise of learner autonomy, to challenges posed by the altered learning environment. Results of the study also show that participants had different perceptions of the three teaching modes and that students’ exercise of learner autonomy influenced their perception of these ICT-based teaching modes."

The political importance of this topic is rooted in the fact that higher education is one of the most crucial public goods (Marginson, 2007, 2017) and governments tend to exercise tighter control over HEIs while democratic conditions worsening (Perry, 2015). Although many studies have examined the effects of the transition to democracy on higher education globally (O’Donnell et al., 2013; O’Donnell et al., 1986, Salto, 2020), very few have studied the reverse trend – democratic backsliding. Given that university autonomy is a wider term that encompasses the practises undertaken by universities to operate, researching its aspects, and assessing the true implications of democratic backsliding on universities represents an important field for current and future research.\n My research investigates the impact of democratic backsliding on the university autonomy, by examining the cases of Turkey, Hungary, and Poland. These countries were considered democracies until the 2010s, but they are increasingly moving away from democracy (Freedom House, 2020). The study draws on an extensive analysis of publicly accessible government laws and regulations, university decrees, mission statements, political pamphlets, online media sources and interviews, and grey literature to analyze institutional responses as well as field work and interviews. I employ neoliberal authoritarianism and historical institutionalism as a framework to investigate the critical junctures and institutional changes affecting appointive (hiring, promotion, and dismissal of staff), financial (funding levels and criteria, preparation and allocation of the university budget, and accountability), and academic (access, curriculum, degree requirements, and academic freedom) autonomy (Ordorika, 2003)."

Hand loss can significantly affect the level of autonomy and the capability of performing the activities of daily life. the technological improvements have led to the development of mechanically advanced commercial prostheses, the control strategies are rather simple (proportional or on/off control). The use of these commercial systems is unnatural and not intuitive, and therefore frequently abandoned by amputees. The components of an active prosthetic hand are the mechatronic device, the decoding system of human biological signals into gestures and the control law that translates all the inputs into desired movements. The real challenge is the development of a control law replacing human hand functions. This paper presents a literature review of the control strategies of prosthetics hands with a multiple-layer or hierarchical structure, and points out the main critical aspects of the current solutions, in terms of human’ functions replicated with the prosthetic device. The paper finally provides several suggestions for designing a control strategy able to mimic the functions of the human hand."

Several theoretical and empirical studies deal with the didactics of using modern technology in the classroom. Most studies highlight the neutral (Zsolnai, 2017) or positive impact of using ICT in the classroom. Only a few address the negative effects of digitally enhanced learning (Dávila, Casabayó, & Rayburn, 2018; Livingstone, 2012; Lorenzo & Trujillo, 2018). State education has continually tried to integrate modern technology with education, but there are also examples of institutional restrictions on its use and even a total ban can also be found. Purpose: This study provides an overview of the pedagogical and epistemological reasons why Waldorf pedagogy and Waldorf Steiner schools take a critical approach to the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) and to “screens” in general, together with mapping out the current state of Waldorf schools in Hungary. Methods: In the present study, we applied source analysis as a traditional research method in the philosophy of education. Conclusions: The findings show that the institutional use of information and communication technologies entirely contradicts the basis, tasks and spirit of Waldorf pedagogy. If we look at the epistemology and anthroposophical anthropology of Waldorf pedagogy, we can see that the autonomy of a Waldorf teacher is not limitless, and so a continuous practical and theoretical responsibility of the Waldorf movement and Waldorf teachers is to establish and uphold coherence between the practices of every Waldorf institution and Waldorf pedagogy."

Design: The research employed a qualitative method, with a video demonstration,Â and analysis provided by the participants. To guide the study, the Technology Acceptance Model was used in order to measure perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Methods: Focus Groups were used to collect nurses’ perspectivesÂ on the developed device. Recruitment followed a snowball sampling method. Eligible participants received an email with anÂ informed consent form. Privacy and confidentiality were maintained throughout. Content analysis was performed using ATLAS.ti v7, with Bardin’s technique, i.e., an a posteriori categorical organization. Results: Three categories were identified as relevant to the study objectives: “Therapeutic adherence and motivation”; “Home and autonomy of the patient and caregiver”; and “Factors that facilitate the practice of the rehabilitation nurse”. Participants felt that the innovation and technological complexity of the device might help to increase patient motivation and adherence, which would be of great use to rehabilitation nurses, allowing better intervention development. Conclusion: Participants perceived the device as useful toÂ practice, and beneficial to post-infarction patients. Interestingly, the complexity inherent to the device is regarded as a factor that may increase motivation and adherence."

Despite the fact that the school climate has a significant impact on teenage IGA, little research has looked into the underlying mediating processes. This cross-sectional study looked at the impact of adolescents’ perceptions of their school climate (including teacher-student support, student-student support, and opportunities for autonomy) on IGA in a sample of 1053 Chinese adolescents (Meanage = 13.52 years; 52.4% females) using convenient sampling methodology, as well as whether deviant peer affiliation mediated this association. Adolescents’ school climate, IGA, and deviant peer affiliation were examined using the School Climate Questionnaire, Internet Gaming Addiction Scale, and two validated tools in this study. The results showed that teacher-student support and student-student support were both negatively associated with IGA, and that these correlations were mediated by deviant peer affiliation. The implications of these findings are discussed."

However, when it comes to their own learning, they are obliged to attend activities organized by their institution. Triggered by this dilemma, this study introduced Computer-Mediated Communication as an alternative to the top-down delivery of trainer-fronted professional development and explored teachers’ uptake of Web 2.0 in the pre-pandemic era. To obtain comprehensive insights into teachers’ perceptions related to the use of Web 2.0 for their own learning, the study employed qualitative and quantitative methodology. Study results revealed that teacher development cannot be promoted with the use of Web 2.0 per se as it is very much dependent on teacher awareness, autonomy, beliefs, contextual realities but most significantly student learning. Despite limitations, this study highlights the principle of learner-centeredness as the key for promoting teacher development and the need to make prospective teacher learning practices an integral part of student-focused activity. Based on the results of the study, it is recommended that the multi-dimensional nature of teacher learning and contextual realities at multiple levels are considered in the design of post-pandemic teacher development schemes, significantly in institutions with low-autonomy cultures in order to turn top-down teacher development practices which teachers are used to into teacher initiated bottom-up learning processes."

It has been key for adolescents to pursue distance education, and their use and mastery of technological means and tools with Internet access has increased. In this study, the motivation, specifically in the interest, digital competence, autonomy, and social interaction, generated by ICTs in the daily lives of adolescents during the pandemic caused by COVID-19 was analyzed. In the study, the objective was to study the motivation, use and commitment generated by ICTs in these students in relation to their gender and age after their confinement to the classroom caused by the first wave of incoming students. An experimental method of descriptive and correlative design was used along with a quantitative method to analyze the data. The data were obtained in the year 2020 through a validated questionnaire committed to the ICT scale used by PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment). A total of 924 students from the sixth grade of primary education in the autonomous city of Ceuta (Spain), aged between 10 and 13, participated in the sample. The results reveal that the motivation and commitment to ICT in these age groups were medium in relation to the total mean of results on a Likert-5 scale. Boys scored higher in all the variables analyzed, and both age and gender show correlations, in addition to the factor of prediction. In conclusion, students in the sixth year of primary education, after the confinement period, were medium-high in their use and engagement of ICT. In addition, gender and age affected ICT use and engagement."

Lawless \nWe review the progress in developing a science of interdependence applied to the determinations and perceptions of risk for autonomous human–machine systems based on a case study of the Department of Defense’s (DoD) faulty determination of risk in a drone strike in Afghanistan; the DoD’s assessment was rushed, suppressing alternative risk perceptions. We begin by contrasting the lack of success found in a case study from the commercial sphere (Facebook’s use of machine intelligence to find and categorize “hate speech”). Then, after the DoD case study, we draw a comparison with the Department of Energy’s (DOE) mismanagement of its military nuclear wastes that created health risks to the public, DOE employees, and the environment. The DOE recovered by defending its risk determinations and challenging risk perceptions in public. We apply this process to autonomous human–machine systems. The result from this review is a major discovery about the costly suppression of risk perceptions to best determine actual risks, whether for the military, business, or politics. For autonomous systems, we conclude that the determinations of actual risks need to be limited in scope as much as feasible; and that a process of free and open debate needs to be adopted that challenges the risk perceptions arising in situations facing uncertainty as the best, and possibly the only, path forward to a solution."

This paper aims to provide principles to guide executives as they launch or scale-up IoT initiatives. Design/methodology/approach This paper draws upon data from original expert interviews and an extensive study of existing scholarly literature, management publications and white papers from leading strategy and technology firms. Findings Close cooperation among a company’s operations, business strategy and information technology units creates a trifecta of skills, vision and budgeting that can successfully bring major IoT initiatives to fruition. Unfortunately, many companies face a misalignment among these departments. The way to overcome this misalignment is to create a cross-functional team dedicated to IoT initiatives. Leaders should build these teams on the principles of autonomy, rational compensation, equality and diversity. Practical implications This paper provides strategic advice for business leaders as well as four guiding principles with which to execute their IoT strategies. Originality/value Much of the writing about IoT advocates initiatives by teaching about the many business benefits of IoT or provides a use case for a specific type of IoT technology. This paper focuses on removing a major obstacle faced by many business leaders who want to embrace the IoT but find themselves unable to do so."

The organizational and pedagogical approaches to efficient EFL learning in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic have been outlined. Furthermore, the main perspectives and challenges appearing in an online learning environment have been characterized. The proposed paper aims to consider the possibility of integrating innovative computer technologies into online foreign language learning to foster students’ autonomy and boost their language proficiency. The findings suggest that using ICT is beneficial for mastering a foreign language in out-of-class settings. Admittedly, there is no perfect or universal blend that may suit all the EFL learning environments. Therefore, it is claimed that blended programs should be created for each academic course regarding students’ wants, needs, and abilities. Furthermore, each higher educational institution needs to have a strategy for designing and implementing a distance EFL learning program that considers instructional, pedagogical, and technological factors."

In this article, I argue that the main goal of both thinkers is to investigate ways to overcome internal and purely formal interpretations without falling into vulgar sociological explanations that reduce cultural forms to external social context. In line with the thesis of “priority of mediation” of his negative dialectics, Adorno develops a meta-critical style of interpretation based on establishing formal analogies between different fields which abolishes the illusion of absolute autonomy of cultural forms while acknowledging their truth contents. In his reflexive sociological critique, Bourdieu aims to reveal social and political implications of cultural forms without reducing them to external social context by building homologies between different fields. I try to reveal the common aspects of these critical methods through the Heidegger critiques of two thinkers. I also try to show that the dialectical critiques of rationality of them echo each other in aiming to reach an understanding of reason free from domination and symbolic violence by revealing the social mediations of reason that embodied in cultural fields."

The sample consisted of an experimental group and a control group. The experimental group consisted of 120 students who were exposed to three main online tools (Newsela.com, mrnussbaum.com, and rewordify.com), with virtual meetings and instruction provided through Facebook. The Facebook groups were kept secret, with only participants joining. The control group consisted of 120 students that benefited only from the university’s regular reading courses. The experimental intervention period was followed by interviews with a sample of 25 students from both groups, providing a qualitative perspective. The overall results suggest that online resources have a positive effect on the development of metacognitive skills. Students tend to appreciate the inclusion of online resources in the classroom without devaluing the role of their EFL teacher – the students did not expect online resources to fully replace the role of their teachers.Keywords: EFL online learning autonomy; learning autonomy; online resources; teaching and learning in higher education"

Because such a writing process frequently occurs outside of a formal learning setting, few attempts to study the phenomenon have been made. Through the lens of the activity theory, the paper analyses the influence of six components in a CV writing process from a social-constructivist approach. A mixed-method approach was adopted with a Likert scale survey with open-ended questions and semi-structured interviews. Quantitative data from 184 participants revealed that students were mostly influenced by various digital artifacts (e.g., online dictionaries, online courses) and situated in online communities of learning. Qualitative results also indicate the prominent challenges relating to syntax and lexical use as one the conflicting factors and a certain level of autonomy as a facilitating factor while they managed to overcome these complications. The paper suggests how the curriculum of Business English could be adapted to support language learners in real-life employment situations."

Yet, in Ethiopia, public opinion over the subject has never been homogenous as there are both apparent faiths that the initiative would positively contribute to Ethiopia’s economy, and suspicions that it is merely Chinas veiled ambition to accelerate its expansion in global economy and politics, intensifying the concerns that China will not be any different from former colonial powers for African nations. Besides mainstream media coverage, much of the debate over this initiative has increasingly happened on social networking sites as attributable to their relative accessibility and autonomy. By employing a thematic content analysis of Twitter contents generated by opinion technicians during the 2019 Belt and Road Initiative Forum in Beijing, this article examines how opinion technicians over the Ethiopian Twittersphere discuss the initiative."

In this article, we suggest a valuation approach towards Internet practices in later life that explores Internet practices not as “use” or “non-use,” but rather asks which forms of Internet practices are valued in later life, and which ones are de-valued. For this valuog­raphy, we draw upon different data sources, including interviews with older adults, to explore the multiple “goods” and “bads” through which Internet use in later life gets valued. The findings suggest two registers of value: autonomy and innovation. Valued Internet practices in later life are therefore done by an autonomous, older individual and include innovative technologies. We conclude that a performative, reflexive, and value-oriented understanding of Internet practices sheds light on the “Internet Multiple,” or the many different shapes the Internet takes in older people’s lives that go beyond a “use” and “non-use” binary."

The Intelligent Agent plays a unique role in networked teaching by making up for the lack of intelligence, adaptiveness, autonomy, and interoperability and interactivity in all aspects of traditional teaching. This paper introduces the knowledge of Intelligent Agent and then discusses its application in the networked teaching environment. Compared with the traditional teaching environment, the intelligent network teaching environment is more conducive to the initiative and innovation of students, reflecting the characteristics of student-centred learning and achieving a variety of functions such as teaching resource sharing, information interaction, online communication, and distance learning with the support of computer network technology. It is a new field to be explored, especially opening up a new chapter of online vocal music teaching."

As a key part of the future development of cities, education is facing tremendous pressure and challenges. How to use all kinds of smart technologies to promote the informatization of education and create a new era of smarter education is an important mission of current smart education. Decision tree classification is a frequently used technique in data mining. It has the characteristics of fast classification and high efficiency. It is not only used to analyze data but also to make predictions. Professional art education occupies an important position in college education. How to combine decision tree algorithms to develop targeted and effective professional art education and to strengthen the teaching reform and research method innovation of art design has become the current teaching work of colleges and universities. The purpose of this paper is to optimize the teaching mode of art courses in colleges and universities, improve the teaching effect of art classes, and realize the teaching goal of art courses. In this paper, art curriculum teaching experience and the reality of teaching research, through analyzing three local questionnaire surveys of college students, based on the principle of students’ subjectivity from the topic content, organization form, evaluation mode of college art teaching in our student autonomy, initiative, and the role of creative mechanisms are discussed. According to the practical teaching activities of art courses conducted in this paper, the satisfaction degree of college students with art courses is up to 92%, which indicates that this experiment is still relatively successful and significant, and arouses students’ subjectivity to some extent."

One example of what this future might hold was recently presented by Facebook Reality Labs (FRL) who work on augmented reality (AR) glasses powered by contextually aware AI that allows the user to “communicate, navigate, learn, share, and take action in the world” (Facebook Reality Labs 2021). A major feature of those glasses is “the intelligent click” that presents action prompts to the user based on their personal history and previous choices. The user can accept or decline those suggested action prompts depending on individual preferences. Facebook/Meta presents this technology as a gateway to “increased agency”. However, Facebook’s claim presumes a simplistic view of agency according to which our agentive capacities increase parallel to the ease in which our actions are carried out. Technologies that structure people’s lives need to be based on a deeper understanding of agency that serves as the conceptual basis in which predictive algorithms are developed. With the goal of mapping this emerging terrain, the aim of this paper is to offer a thorough analysis of the agency-limiting risks and the agency-enhancing potentials of Facebook’s “intelligent click” feature. Based on a concept of agency by Dignum (Responsible Artificial Intelligence: How to Develop and Use AI in a Responsible Way. Springer International Publishing, Cham, 2019), the three agential dimensions of autonomy (acting independently), adaptability (reacting to changes in the environment), and interactivity (interacting with other agents) are analyzed towards our ability to make self-determining choices."

Kassem \nSaudi EFL learners have been traditionally described as non-autonomous. During the coronavirus pandemic, Saudi universities shifted to online education. Scholars maintain that online education by its very nature enhances learner autonomy. The current study, that was conducted after students received three semesters of online education, aimed to explore the effect of the shift to online education on Saudi college EFL learners’ autonomy. It also investigated gender differences in learner autonomy. Both quantitative data by means of a self-report questionnaire (N=306) and qualitative data by means of a semi-structured online interview (N=20) were collected and analyzed. Quantitative data revealed that Saudi college EFL learners are autonomous (with a total mean of 4.02 out of 5). This mean is much higher than the means obtained in studies conducted before the shift to online education. Females outperformed males in just one dimension of learner autonomy, autonomous learning enjoyment. No gender differences were found in the other dimensions of learner autonomy or total learner autonomy. Qualitative data analysis indicated that students attributed to online education improvement in five important aspects of their learner autonomy, namely, goal setting and organization of study time, the use of the Internet and social media as learning resources, the use of performance feedback, self-assessment and computer skills. An aspect that witnessed some improvement but still has room for much improvement is reflection on learning.<p> </p><p><strong> Article visualizations:</strong></p><p><img src=“/-counters-/edu_01/0926/a.php” alt=“Hit counter” /></p>"

Three hundred and six adults from a range of countries completed an online questionnaire that assessed individual difference predictors (the Big Five personality factors, curiosity, need for cognition, need to belong, age, and gender), aspects of podcast listening (amount, format, setting, device, and social aspects), and potential outcomes (autonomy, competence, relatedness, meaning, mindfulness, and smartphone addiction). As predicted, openness to experience, interest-based curiosity, and need for cognition positively predicted podcast listening. Contrary to predictions, need to belong negatively predicted podcast listening, and time spent listening to podcasts was not associated with autonomy, competence, relatedness, meaning, mindfulness, or smartphone addiction. However, certain aspects of podcast listening (e.g., parasocial relationships and social engagement) were related to positive outcomes and to our predictor variables. Furthermore, neuroticism negatively predicted podcast listening. Overall, the findings support the idea that informational motives can play a role in podcast listening, and that some aspects of listening are associated with positive outcomes."

In a society heavily influenced by consumerism, we find ourselves manipulated by social media and targeted advertising to buy goods or to cultivate a certain lifestyle, raising important ethical questions about responsibility and our autonomy to make decisions. How has the nature of how we create and consume goods evolved and how is this linked to moral responsibility and autonomy? Can it also be argued that there is aesthetic appreciation to be gained from some of the items that we create and consume?"

In this study, we examine how technostress affects knowledge hiding. Drawing from the energy-consuming characteristic of technostress and prior research on how technostress affects ICT users, this article builds and tests a model that takes work exhaustion as a mediator and explored the moderating role of job autonomy. To test our conceptual model, we examined the responses to a survey questionnaire submitted by 287 ICT users from multiple organizations. Using structural equation modeling, we found that technostress increases employees’ knowledge hiding behavior, and work exhaustion partially mediates technostress and knowledge hiding, while job autonomy only moderates the relationship between technostress and work exhaustion when the fourth factor of technological stress, techno-insecurity, is excluded. We also discuss future research directions and implications of the results."

R. Batita \n Yau-Jane Chen \nThis study is based on the separation of teachers and learners caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the implication of Moore’s Transactional Distance Theory, which proliferated for nearly 30 years but has been inconsistently validated empirically. The quantitative approach was employed, with questionnaires distributed based on the learners’ perspectives. The subjects of the study include 153 respondents from computer science department of an Indonesian public university. Three key tenets of transactional distance include dialogue, structure, and learner autonomy were specifically addressed and validated as significant predictors in this study. The findings elucidated an inverse relationship between dialogue and learner autonomy respectively with transactional distance, and a less rigid course structure capable of contributing to lessen the perceived degree of transactional distance in the e-learning environment. Furthermore, this study discovered that e-learning satisfaction and internet connection speed had an impact on the extent of transactional distance."

Bourdieu, the processes taking place in visual art practice under the influence of the development of the Internet are considered. Contemporary art practices and digital art explore the same symbolic capital from different conceptual positions. For contemporary artistic practice, the critical theory and idea of D. Kossuth about the search for the boundaries of art as such, the study of the socio-cultural reality of the here-and-now, and the formulation of the principles of identity remain the main ones. In digital practices, the focus is on the search for an individual style through the study of the structural features of the artistic language itself, autonomy from verbal commentary. The presence of these vectors is also associated with the redistribution of power capital under the influence of the development of network culture and the Internet, when the museum and gallery sphere is not able to control all the processes taking place in art practice. Not one of the participants in artistic communication possesses the integrity of power. Networks today have become a platform with their own power and authority. At the same time, rules from offline flow into the virtual environment and new restrictions are created, related both to the ontological features of digital logic and to the work of online communities."

It employed a mixed-method approach in which data were collected simultaneously using an open-ended questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. The study involved 95 English teachers from vocational schools in two cities of East Java, Indonesia. Among the participants, four were invited to participate in an online interview to discuss their perspectives on the characteristics, use and development of MALL material for vocational students. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics. The analysis results showed that more than half of the respondents agreed that MALL resources were more accessible (65.4%), easier to generate (65.4%) and more successful at improving learners’ autonomy (73.1%), compared to traditional materials. Additionally, 40% of teachers thought that MALL materials could be used to promote classroom interaction, and it was much easier for teachers to provide immediate feedback through mobile phone. In summary, 42% of teachers agreed that MALL resources could aid in foreign language acquisition. Due to students’ proximity to technology and mobile devices, teachers recognized that MALL materials can be applied inside and outside the classrooms. Therefore, vocational EFL teachers must be able to develop and implement MALL materials in their classrooms."

Several theoretical and empirical studies deal with the didactics of using modern technology in the classroom. Most studies highlight the neutral (Zsolnai, 2017) or positive impact of using ICT in the classroom. Only a few address the negative effects of digitally enhanced learning (Dávila, Casabayó, & Rayburn, 2018; Livingstone, 2012; Lorenzo & Trujillo, 2018). State education has continually tried to integrate modern technology with education, but there are also examples of institutional restrictions on its use and even a total ban can also be found. Purpose: This study provides an overview of the pedagogical and epistemological reasons why Waldorf pedagogy and Waldorf Steiner schools take a critical approach to the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) and to “screens” in general, together with mapping out the current state of Waldorf schools in Hungary. Methods: In the present study, we applied source analysis as a traditional research method in the philosophy of education. Conclusions: The findings show that the institutional use of information and communication technologies entirely contradicts the basis, tasks and spirit of Waldorf pedagogy. If we look at the epistemology and anthroposophical anthropology of Waldorf pedagogy, we can see that the autonomy of a Waldorf teacher is not limitless, and so a continuous practical and theoretical responsibility of the Waldorf movement and Waldorf teachers is to establish and uphold coherence between the practices of every Waldorf institution and Waldorf pedagogy."

Diverging from traditional methods, this study discusses the influencing factors of AI-supported consumer value co-creation from the perspective of human-to-non-human interactions. This study adopts the stimulus–organism–response framework with consumer engagement (CE) as the intermediary to explore the impact of consumers’ personal subjective factors, community factors, and perceptions of AI technology on their value co-creating behaviors. Data were collected from 528 respondents from the Huawei Huafen Club, Xiaomi BBS, Apple China Virtual Brand, Micromobile Phone, and Lenovo communities. SPSS Amos software was used for statistical analysis, revealing that perceived personalization, autonomy, community identity, trust in AI, and self-efficacy are motivational factors that have significant effects on consumer value co-creation behaviors, in which CE plays a significant intermediary role. Our study contributes to the literature on consumer value co-creation supported by AI technology. We also offer important insights for developers of AI-enabled products and service managers."

The sample population is comprised of Chinese citizens born in China. Data were collected through one-on-one, online semi-structured interviews using WeChat. The interview questions are structured to allow participants to explain personality traits found in productive and unproductive remote workers. In addition, the questions explore traits positively associated with developing trust and how the psychological needs of autonomy, competency, and relatedness impact remote workers. After data collection, the data were analyzed and coded to develop themes used to answer the core research questions. This study’s findings offer benefits to companies using remote workers and employees new to remote work or those aiming to become remote workers since the data collected provides a holistic picture of remote work from actual workers’ perspective. The information gathered from the research participants allowed the researcher to determine that one of the most beneficial aspects of remote work is autonomy and the ability to set one’s schedule. Confidence directly impacts feelings of competency among remote workers, and relatedness is negatively impacted by being a remote worker because of decreased opportunities for face-to-face interactions."

Based on a survey study of 500 food-delivery workers (‘riders’) in China, we provide quantitative evidence of workers’ ambivalent subjective experiences that complements the predominantly qualitative account in the extant literature. In particular, we assess the complex relationships between meaningfulness of work, autonomy at work, self-perceived competence, and workers’ subjective well-being. Our data also show that the stress-buffering effect of social support mainly comes from the riders’ familial contact and their online group chat with other workers. Overall, despite the well-documented precarity and stress in platform work, the riders in our sample appear to be able to mobilize inner and relational resources to achieve a relatively high-level mental well-being."

The autonomy experienced by generation Z adolescents is followed by behavior that is difficult to understand and sometimes misinterpreted as rebellion, for example disagreeing with their parents and doing things without the help of their parents anymore. Based on this phenomenon, this study aims to analyze the meaning of autonomy for generation Z adolescents. This study uses a qualitative approach with phenomenological methods. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and then analyzed using the Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) technique on four adolescents (19-21 years). Based on the results of the analysis obtained the meaning of independence for generation Z adolescents, namely: (1) efforts to reduce intervention / assistance from parents; (2) differing views with parents; (3) accept the opportunity of parents to make decisions; and (4) the initiative to build work experience."

As hackers continue to explore and exploit, safeguarding systems and networks become even more difcult. Due to the pervasive deployment of cyber-physical systems and IOT devices, the need to defend the number and complexity of the systems increases rapidly. This is where cyber autonomy comes to our rescue. Cyber autonomy can help a system to identify attacks, patch vulnerabilities and if required, counterattack without the help of an IT specialist. Taking a cue from above, this paper aims to suggest multiple prospects cyber autonomy can bring to India’s cyber security framework and its potential consequences, as digital India remains the aim of every Indian."

Quality improvement and development of education thus become strategic issues for any local government. This study aims to address issues related to: (1) the condition of school facilities and infrastructure (2) the role of school committees which is not optimal; (3) the absence of equitable distribution of teachers; and (4) the lack of Information and Communication Technology/ICT-based learning application in in secondary schools. The research was conducted in four districts, namely Bangkalan, Sampang, Pamekasan and Sumenep. The main theory employed in this study is the School Based Management (SBM) or the so-called School Based Management (SBM). The population was students, parents and teachers. The total number of samples was 250 people comprising 100 students, 100 parents and 50 teachers. The research data were obtained from primary and secondary data. The study yielded a number of key findings. First, 90% of High School (or its equivalent) teachers master the materials taught. This is due to fact that the materials taught are in accordance with the education qualification of the teacher. Secondly, the mismatch found in Madurese high schools was apparently caused by the lack of educators with suitable qualification for the subjects they teach concurrently. Almost all secondary teachers in Madura island require trainings related to the development of competency for mastering the subject materials. The last but not the least, the majority of teachers still apply simple learning methods. Although the method applied by teachers are generally similar, there are significant differences between the favorite schools and the other schools."

It should not be absolute in nature. Due to the conglomeration of various technologies in a secure cyber physical system it is quite a challenge to handle trust issues in a cyber physical system. Trust management in cyber physical system is needed due to increase in the degree of autonomy, decentralized policies ,dynamic environment, decision-making based on social rules,customs,laws,values, and ethics. This chapter brings light into the existing strategies already applied by few organizations, their inherent benefits and consequent shortcomings too. There are many factors contributing towards the establishment, expression, evaluation ,maintenance of trustworthiness. In this chapter we advocate a novel framework for trust management which stands up to the research directions of how to build a unified framework for trust management, how to modify the way we compute trust, how to decide the right granularity for a trust model"

    "text": "Doc 1635 :  Free \nhttps://doi.org/10.5204/mcj.2640\n Trebor Scholz \n Rachel Cobcroft \n\n \n \n \n This issue of M/C Journal reclaims the language of “freedom”. \n \n The selected articles demonstrate that today freedom is frequently overruled in the name of a permanent state of emergency. Present-day politics shows countless instances in which information, knowledge and culture are not seen as an inalienable right but are rather oppressed and distorted. Freedom is the freedom to say “no”, to withdraw your collaboration, to refuse friendly cooperation! To be “free” means to be able to enact your identity without having to capitulate to the ruling forces that dictate which discourses are and are not permissible in the public sphere(s).\n \n Citizens worldwide are armchair passengers on the nightly TV news train; they dream of their lives as being “free”. After all, to be free is a guaranteed human right, enshrined by the United Nations. Are freedom, independence and autonomy merely illusions, or are sociable media succeeding in empowering citizens for a participatory democracy as Yochai Benkler argues? If information “wants to be free”, the battle between intellectual “property” and creativity must be resolved. Technology does not make freedom inevitable: the on-the-ground-realities of network and hardware access make what seems to be “open” and “free”, closed and expensive for most people on this planet.\n \n The feature article for this issue of M/C Journal is a statement on the state of free speech in a free country: in “Depiction of Muslims in Selected Australian Media: Free Speech or Taking Sides”, Dr Nahid Kabir examines the publication of 12 cartoons depicting images of the Prophet Mohammad in 2005. In exploring the response of two Australian newspapers to the Danish controversy, the article considers whether the debate in the name of “free speech” has ended in a “form of attack” on Australian Muslims. \n \n In “Freedom, Hate, Fronts”, Patrick Lynn Rivers reflects on the use of the Internet by the predominantly Afrikaner “Vryheidsfront Plus” political party to construct whiteness in post-apartheid South Africa. The creation of a politics centred on racial “cyborgs” points to the facilitation of freedom of an “oppressed minority”, continuing the Afrikaners’ historical struggle for self-determination and independence. Problematising this approach, Rivers concludes that, like freedom, whiteness after apartheid is far from defined.\n \n Authors Amita Nijhawan and Sukhmani Khorana both address Deepa Mehta’s highly-acclaimed film trilogy Fire, Earth, and Water. As a female Hindu director, Mehta engages controversial issues for Indian society: the life of widows who are forced into prostitution, for example. As observed, the trilogy has been subject to critiques of too much freedom from inside the country, counterbalanced by those outside the country condemning the Indian body-politic for its lack of freedom. In exploring post-colonial discourses in India’s construction of nation and gender, Nijhawan and Khorana present complementary accounts of the director’s struggle to resist government censorship. Hegemonic power is played out in the definition of freedom in relation to contested questions of self-representation in Indian society.\n \n Freedom of use and the notion of “property talk” are discussed by Australian lawyer and academic Steve Collins, commenting on the revival of values from Blackstonian copyright, in which ownership is seen to preclude the rights of others. Collins observes that talk of “property” risks making transformative works an elitist form of creativity, available only to those with the financial resources necessary to meet the demands for license fees. The notion of “property” thus challenges the freedom to create and to transform. Collins notes that this is no longer a philosophical question, but a practical one, as he entreats courts to move beyond the propertarian paradigm.\n \n A further angle on the issue of freedom is put forward by Nadine Henley in “Free to be Obese?” Here, Henley tackles the boundaries of state governance in controlling the bodies of its citizens: Is it ethical for a government to enforce the health of its citizens, or should obesity, for example, be a rightful choice?\n \n Two emotive Freedom Poems by Kathryn Waddell Takara conclude this issue. The editors have selected “Angela Davis” and “Mumia Abu Jamal: Knight for Justice” from the larger body of Takara’s work, Root Tapping, as representing the desire to celebrate freedom. The expectation of Angela Davis’ arrival and the transcendent revenge for the imprisonment of political activist Mumia Abu Jamal speak of the power of radical opposition in the face of oppression.\n \n The cover image of this issue, “Free” by John Fairley (“Bostich”), has been derived from the photo-sharing Flickr.com, which supports the Creative Commons licensing scheme.\n \n Acknowledgments:\n \n The editors thank all contributors and reviewers involved in this issue for their continuing dialogue and critical reflection on the notion of “freedom”.

The directions refected at the level of the federal law on education, national doctrines and projects, federal target programs, letters of the Ministry of Education, and professional standards are considered. The change of the ‘knowledge’ paradigm to the ‘competence’ one is accompanied by the increasing use of digital technologies in all aspects of life, including education. Technological progress has led to computerization, and further informatization of education. The ubiquitous spread of the Internet, directed by the Federal target program «Electronic Russia» (2002-2010) and the National project «Education», should have expanded the boundaries through the implementation of e-learning and distance learning technologies, promote democratization and accessibility of education, make the educational space more open. However, the monitoring has revealed problems with the overall strategy of e-education, the availability of the learning environment, and the availability of educational and methodological support. One of the possible ways to solve the problem is to appeal to open education and the implementation of massive open online courses, which are now designed by the leading Russian universities. A change of requirements for the participants of the educational process, an increase in students’ autonomy, a tendency of forming an individual learning path, the use of project and group techniques based on digital technologies are seen. These measures should contribute to the competitiveness of the Russian higher education in the world."

The findings showcase several changes in the teaching-learning circumstances that affect the implementation of in-class activities. The students share that YouTube and TED help them enrich their English vocabulary. Further, they also state that the tasks create a more dynamic and less monotonous learning atmosphere. Overall, the use of YouTube and TED can be designed to be effective instructional media for Extensive Listening tasks."

The scope of Islamic law is broader than the common law or civil law. In addition to core legal doctrines covering the family, wrongs, procedure, and commercial transactions, Islamic law also includes detailed rules regulating religious ritual and social etiquette. In Islam, religiosity is not asceticism in monasteries nor is it chattering from the pulpits. Instead, it is behaving in a manner that is requested from the Creator under all circumstances, places and times, in belief, statement and actions. Historically, law and religion have never been completely separated. They have never been so independent as to achieve complete autonomy from each other. Religion has essentially been embodied in legal systems, even in those that have aspired to privatize religion. Based on this fact, this paper discusses such fact i.e religiosity on specific theme of Islamic law that is criminal law which means the body of law dealing with wrongs that are punishable in Islamic law with the object of deterrence."

The project aims to provide a more authentic learning opportunity that integrates concepts from the concurrent courses, as well as prior courses. The project was carefully designed to provide some student autonomy while ensuring competence can be achieved by students with a broad range of initial skill levels through the completion of authentic tasks. The impacts of the revised project on student learning were measured using pre- and postproject surveys, course grades and course critiques. Despite significant challenges that were encountered during the first two offerings, the results show that students perceived an increased competence in several key skills, and an increase was seen in overall course satisfaction."

This will be an inter-ministerial initiative where all the ministries and departments will bring their services to the public such as health, education and judicial service, etc. The Public Private Partnership (PPP) model will be adopted as a choice. This scheme is one of the top priority projects of the Central Government. While there are many significant drawbacks like legal framework, lack of privacy, lack of data security rules, civilian autonomy abuses, and lack of parliamentary surveillance for Indian e-surveillance and Indian cyber insecurity. All these shortcomings will be removed before implementing Digital India."

It is a case study whose data were collected through a questionnaire prepared in Google Forms, which was applied through a link to one hundred and five teachers of different subjects who work in municipal, state or federal public and private schools, in high school and / or in the final years of elementary school. The collected data were analyzed in the light of a literature that explores the ERE and its implementation. The results obtained showed a diversity of practices carried out by means of Digital Information and Communication Technologies (DICT), part of which is in line with the modus operandi of traditional education and part of which seeks to overcome it. Taken together, these practices can provide students with more autonomy, new forms of communication between educational actors and the acquisition of new learning about the pedagogical use of DICT with the potential to modify the teaching that succeeds the pandemic, when we return to the “new normal” of classroom teaching"

There are a number of factors enabling adolescents to make use of social media positively. One of the factors studied in this research is the adolescent worldview. The adolescent worldview greatly determines the way she behaves and her attitude towards social media. The result of this research shows that adolescent worldview may release and enables her to reject negative impacts of social media, particularly from modern culturalisms as relativism, individualism, emotionalism, presentism (present-time ism), materialism, autonomy, victimism, and turn it into a positive impact on herself. Worldviews may be differentiated based on three categories namely religion, spirituality and secularity. This research is conducted by explorative-qualitative approach, using case study research method. Data collection process was conducted by in-depth interview with late adolescents."

The world community has begun searching for and testing models for organising the educational process in a new reality. The purpose of this study was to analyse how the education system in Ukraine is functioning under the COVID-19 pandemic. The theoretical framework for considering the research problem is based on the theory of synergetics. Such synergetic postulates as openness, evolution, dynamics, bifurcation point, interaction, self-organisation, irreversibility and new state are key guidelines for understanding the processes taking place in Ukrainian education. A qualitative research approach was used to guide the study. The research methods included the review of the governmental documents, review of the surveys and interviews. The major finding is that the COVID-19 pandemic is transforming the education system in Ukraine and many changes are positive. This includes the long-awaited autonomy of educational institutions, the opportunity to acquire digital skills by educators, strengthening cooperation with regional and local authorities and updates to the overloaded curriculum. The Ukrainian authorities, the pedagogical community and society are working together to organise education under new conditions. However, Ukrainian education faces serious challenges (partly inadequate Internet access in homes, especially in rural areas; lack of educators’ online instruction skills; few official methodological guidelines and online textbooks and low levels of motivation of students to participate in online sessions). The findings thus revealed the importance of a national strategy for the development of education, considering the recommendations of the international organisations and the experience of foreign countries."

The capacity of the village government deemed not qualified to run the authority possessed by law the village. Weak capacity of rural government impact on law implementation failure that led to the poor rural village development. This study examines these issues. This study used qualitative research methods. The unit of analysis of this research that the village government Landungsari Dau District of Malang, East Java. This study was conducted over three years (2016, 2017, 2018). The findings of the research during the last four months in the first year of the study is Landungsari village administration showed a good performance in governance at the village of village autonomy era (the era of the Village Law. The village government is able to carry out rural development planning, village administrative governance, and the financial management of the village properly. Nevertheless, the village government also faces serious problems is the lack of human resource capacity of the village administration, village very less quantity, and village officials do not understand the duties of each. To address these issues, the village government seeks to organize village governance based on information technology (e-government), but the effort has not worked well because the village government does not have a human resources professional in the field of information technology and the village government does not have enough budget to develop the e-government program. Therefore, the research team conducting FGD on the development of e-government program. FGD village government resulted in an agreement in cooperation with governmental science labs and e-government program APBDes budgeted in fiscal year 2017. Step next phase is the research team conducting FGD Phase II to design e-government as a means of governance villages effective and efficient, to disseminate the e-government, and publishes scientific articles on the model of governance based rural e-government in the Journal of Politics and Government Muhammadiyah University of Yogyakarta. Our advice as a researcher is a village government should make regulations governing Internet-based mechanism of public services (e-government). The regulation is to encourage villagers Landungsari to get used to using services based on the Internet, the district government of Malang should provide support to the village government to make innovations in governance, and the central government should support the village government to strengthen rural government institutions such as the addition of the village"

Specific parental characteristics and multi-cultural differences seemed to play an important role in this parental style to appear. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to identify the factors shaping overparenting and the impact in children, adolescents and young adults in Greece, comparing to European and Worldwide context. A literature review was conducted using online databases and words such as «overparenting», «helicopter parents», «intrusive parenting», «parental interference», and «parental control». Overparenting seems to be related to negative effects in children’s psychosocial and mental health. It was associated with lack of autonomy, low levels of self-regulation and mastery, which affected social adjustment skills and higher levels of anxiety, depressive symptoms, poor self-regulation and low levels of life satisfaction in children. In Greece, overparenting was related to poor school adjustment, obesity, internet addiction and post-traumatic stress from bullying. Overparenting is becoming more and more popular, so more research is becoming a necessity. It is important for every state to support and consult parents, from pregnancy to school, with specialized programs and teachers’ training with the collaboration of social scientists. Further research of the phenomenon, in Greece and cross-culturally, is however needed."

By means of in-depth interviews with Israeli physicians from four different specialties, this study explored how physicians cope with internet-informed patients, referred to as e-patients, and examined how they make sense of their new professional roles. Findings show that three types of boundaries in the doctor–patient relationship have been blurred by the emergence of the e-patient: the boundaries between doctors’ and patients’ knowledge, between doctors’ authority and patients’ autonomy , and between positivistic knowledge and humanistic knowledge. Each of these is a boundary between liberal and non-liberal values. Only the combination of all these components produces, according to the participants, a good doctor. I call this new phenomenon integrated medical expertise and explain how it diverges from previous notions of ‘good doctoring’. • When treating e-patients, boundaries between doctor and patient become blurred. • The blurred boundaries reflect transitions from liberal to non-liberal values. • This forms an integrated medical expertise – a new form of medical professionalism."

Design/methodology/approach The authors used qualitative research examining lived experiences and behaviours around social media use. The authors conducted 39 semi-structured interviews with students at various universities across Jordan, alongside an online survey with open-ended questions, which were based on six PWB dimensions: environmental mastery, personal growth, purpose in life, self-acceptance, autonomy and positive relationships with others. Findings Social media use and advertising were found to positively impact students’ self-acceptance and relationships with others but to negatively impact their autonomy. They were found to have different impacts on students’ sense of purpose in life and personal growth, depending on the content shared on their platforms. Originality/value The ethical debate surrounding social media amongst students indicates that such social marketing programmes might stimulate individuals’ sense of control over their environment, encourage openness to new experiences, and give their lives a beneficial direction. The study makes recommendations for the creation of an evidence-based social marketing programme that is extrinsically focussed on increasing resilience, creating an audience persona and building awareness of PWB."

This Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is quickly developing thanks to advances in fields such as information systems, factory digitalization, data sciences, robotics. Thus, industrial markets appear both as business networks - encompassing connections between individual or organizational actors – and networks of connected things. The purpose of this research is to provide an integrative perspective that encompasses both types of networks. It seeks to contribute to the literature on industrial B2B markets in two ways. First, it proposes the system of systems (SoS) theory - which emphasizes diversity and autonomy of systems - as an integrative perspective. Second, it argues that this integrated perspective contributes to a new view on how resources are produced, combined, and used, and, therefore, on business network models. We discuss the implications for one of the most established models, the IMP Group’s A-R-A model. • Traditional representations of business networks may not be adapted in IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) contexts. • In IIoT actors are not only humans or organizations. • In IIoT technologies are not necessarily resources. • A system of systems approach of business networks is introduced. • Impacts on new connections between actors, and value creation are discussed."

A dynamic reputation evaluation method based on supervision feedback of user information behavior is helpful to promote social network self-discipline and achieve good community autonomy. The comprehensive reputation evaluation of each node integrates identity and behavior reputation. And the reputation is dynamically updated by setting the new node evaluation period and phased update mechanism. Identity reputation is calculated by information disclosure and network characteristics; Behavior reputation is calculated by information release and forwarding, and rewards or punishments will be given to self-correction of information behavior or blocking of bad information. The simulation results show that compared with the traditional trust evaluation mechanism, setting rewards and punishments guidance can improve the accuracy of reputation evaluation. At the same time, reputation incentive can also inhibit the interaction of bad information while promoting the consciousness of reporting."

The research also tests demographic variables including socioeconomic status (SES) and gender as covariates. The data were examined through two-step hierarchical regression analyses. Regarding demographics, SES revealed a significant positive contribution to the prediction of math and science performance, whereas gender failed to make a significant contribution. Additionally, after controlling demographics, ICT availability at home significantly and negatively predicted student math and science performance, whilst ICT availability at school was not found to be significantly contributory. Regarding ICT use variables, all constructs significantly predicted student math and science performances, but some negatively contributed to the model, whereas others positively contributed. Amongst ICT attitude variables, all constructs made a significantly positive or negative contribution to predicting both math and science performance, with one exception. Only perceived autonomy in ICT use failed to significantly contribute to the prediction of math performance. Based on the findings, it was concluded that persistent involvement in ICT tends to be related to decreased math and science performance. We propose that policymakers and practitioners drop the myth that ICT use results in better achievement under any circumstances and should therefore refrain from integrating ICT without first undertaking careful planning."

Lastovkina \nThe twentieth century was marked by a large number of various kinds of changes that affected almost all spheres of society. New phenomena began to appear in sociological science, the explanation of which caused difficulties and required sociological theory to rethink the methods and analytical models used by it. Among the factors that have had an active influence on the evolution of the network concept, first of all, we should include the development of transport infrastructure, telephone networks and the Internet. The concept of a network has been increasingly used to explain social phenomena. This approach in modern sociology is called “network”, which, according to many researchers, is quite productive, as it has a high potential in solving existing problems and in forming a response to the emerging tasks of modern sociological science. It should be noted that in the domestic sociological tradition and in applied research, the possibilities of using the “network approach” remain poorly understood. Many Russian sociologists do not include this approach in the focus of their attention. This article presents a comparative theoretical analysis of the existing areas of the network approach. The main aspects of comparison are: the time and context of appearance, the main provisions, the methodology and methods of empirical research. Common features and differences between the analyzed areas are highlighted. At the end of the article, a conclusion is formulated about the autonomy of each of the designated areas. Based on this fact, it is assumed that the term “network approach” is used solely as a collective name for different theories and approaches that operate with the concept of a network in different senses."

Attrition among Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurses (PMHNs) may be related to a lack of leadership empowerment which includes autonomy and access to professional development opportunities. The purposes of this study, guided by Kanter’s theory of structural empowerment, were to determine (a) if there was a relationship between leadership empowerment behavior and PMH RNs’ intent to leave within the first 2 years of practice in inpatient psychiatric settings and (b) if there was a relationship between leadership empowerment behavior and intent to leave among this population who are in their first 2 years of practice, based on RN demographics. The key variables were measured with the Leader Empowering Behavior Questionnaire and the Turnover Intention Scale. The study participants included 111 psychiatric RNs in their first 2 years of practice who were recruited via social media. Results showed an inverse relationship between leadership empowerment behavior and intent to leave. The RN demographic characteristics did not affect this relationship. The study findings could be used for social change by creating awareness for PMHN leaders to develop empowerment behavior as a strategy to mitigate new PMH RN turnover so that they can stay in practice and positively impact therapeutic and quality patient care delivery. Future studies using mixed methods and a larger sample size would be helpful to obtain an in-depth understanding of the role of leadership empowerment behavior and retention from the RN’s perspective."

Graña \n Sebastián Fernández Franco \n David Flacher \n Cecilia Rikap \nThis paper examines the innovation strategy of Siemens, a key player in Europe’s digital economy, by performing network and lexical analyses using data derived from Siemens’s patents and scientific publications since 1998. We observe that the company’s innovation efforts evolved from a broader attempt to develop internal information and communication technology (ICT) capabilities – alongside its historical industrial priorities – to a strategy focused on developing artificial intelligence (AI) for sector-specific and niche applications (such as life and medical sciences). As a result, it became dependent on tech giants’ clouds for accessing more general AI services and digital infrastructure. We build on the intellectual monopoly literature focusing on the effects of tech giants on other leading corporations, to analyse Siemens’s experience. By abandoning the development of general ICT and given the emergence of tech giants as digital economy intellectual monopolies, we show that Siemens is risking its technological autonomy towards these big tech companies. Our results provide clues to understand the challenges faced by Europe and its firms in relation to US and Chinese tech giants."

This necessitates a fundamental change in policy from prescribing professional development to addressing teachers’ self-identified felt needs. Hitherto, teachers are generally disenfranchised from specifying their felt needs for development, thus they feel uninterested, or enthusiastic to attend professional development programs that are prescribed for them by school leaders. When they do or are compelled to attend, they tend to be less attentive and are often indulged in reading newspapers, grading students’ test papers, texting, playing video games, or simply doing something unrelated to the professional development. This practice stifles teachers’ professional growth and student learning, hence it must not be allowed to continue unabated. Through a qualitative case study research design, using survey, interviews, and focus groups, this research brought to the fore, the debilitating effects of the current practice. Analysis of data yielded four major themes: choice, motivation, effectiveness, and satisfaction. The study proposed a paradigm shift in policy from mandating to granting teachers the autonomy to identify their own real or felt needs for professional development. Implications for practice, leadership, policy, and further research were also discussed.</p>"

Kravchenko \nThe work was carried out in line with the current idea of the Internet as a global media that interacts with various sign systems and influences the structural and compositional features of the verbal text. The relevance of the study is due to the formation of the concept of intermediality in the context of a new cultural direction, called “metavirtualism”. The aim of the article is to characterize the principles underlying the structure and composition of the network poetic “book”. Russian-language poetic cycles are considered, the structural and compositional features and expressive means of which are associated with Internet technologies. Such aspects as the type of intermediality and ways of organizing the structure and composition of the network “book” are analyzed; the reader’s way of getting acquainted with the work and the degree of freedom of this way; manifestation of the category of ephemerality. It is concluded that technological poetry, paradoxically, strengthens traditional book forms, but also has an independent value, visualizing poetic images and metaphors. Internet technologies can be “embedded” into the structure and composition of a poetry book at various levels: it can be relative autonomy; interaction at the level of a conceptual metaphor explicated with the help of Internet media (Google maps); almost complete fusion of media."

Special attention is paid to the specific nature of bioethical issues in dermatology, associated with visuality and peculiarities of the course of disease, emotional and physiological background and coexisting disorders. Special priority is given to effective strategies of physician-patient communication, respect for patient autonomy and protection of confidentiality both in clinical practice, and on the Internet. It is shown that linking personal and strategic social media accounts raises a number of ethical and legal issues, associated with obtaining voluntary informed consent, compliance with standards of corporate ethics, and perception of medical information by non-professional audience. In conclusion, compliance with principles and rules of biomedical ethics is important to set constructive relations in clinical dermatological practice, ensure social trust in medicine and prepare future specialists. It is also important to discuss ethical issues in a professional community, slowly forming an interdisciplinary space of communication between physicians, health officials, specialists in bioethics, medical law, psychology and sociology of medicine."

In extremity losses, the traditionally implemented procedure is to enable the extremity to regain its functionality through replantation instead of transplantation. On the other hand, innovative studies are also carried out to support and strengthen the human body and improve the problematic body functions for increasing patients’ quality of life. Studies on developing biomechatronic systems, which are related to biology, neurology, biophysics, mechanics, biomedical and tissue engineering, electronics, and computer sciences, are in progress, which indicates that a transformation has occurred in the approaches to composite tissue transplantation. This study aims to generate ideas about determining a conventional limit in the interventions towards the human body against the technological and scientific developments and to perform a value analysis on such interventions. This study was designed within the framework of the methodology of medical ethics and in the light of the slippery slope argument. The process of transformation from the medical procedures that aim to protect patients’ bodily integrity to the innovative practices that provide an opportunity to bionically turn healthy human bodies into the half machine and half-human is investigated in the light of the slippery slope argument. This study indicated that the value-related problems regarding this issue are related to the principles of respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. The limit to be determined for the practices that aim to protect the patients’ bodily integrity and increase their quality of life and that are not life-saving depends on the distinction between an ill body and a healthy body. A meticulous clinical perspective and legislative regulations that prevent the instrumentalization of humans are required so as not to roll down to undesirable places on a slope. Advanced technological developments are implemented in medicine, protecting human dignity should be adopted as a fundamental value."

This study aims to deepen the understanding of employees’ brand co-creation efforts and their contribution to employee-based brand equity (EBBE). Design/methodology/approach The study analyses implicit and explicit communication activities by employees on the social media network LinkedIn and quantifies the contribution of their posts to EBBE. Data has been gathered from more than 1,300 posts and 130 private accounts, representing different employee groups of five corporate brands. Findings The investigation illustrates the high importance of brand co-creation in social networks by employees and helps practitioners to better understand the underlying processes. Research limitations/implications Case-study research has limitations of generalisability. However, the authors unveil important limits to exploiting the autonomy of employees’ word-of-mouth communication. Practical implications Under a co-creative perspective, every social media activity of an employee can be a positive contribution to a brand’s equity. Therefore, companies should closely monitor EBBE. Originality/value The authors draw on basic conceptual insights and empirical work by other researchers but extend and interpret them in a new context. The study provides initial indications of key antecedents of and barriers to successful management of employees’ brand co-creation activities."

Vodyakha \nThe relevance of the study is determined by the need to develop programs for psychological correction and prevention of violations of parent-child relationships in families raising adolescents with Internet addiction. In the conditions of modern society, there is a steady trend towards an increase in the number of children and adolescents with a tendency to addictive behavior. Parent-child relations, the image of a parent in adolescents with Internet addiction has certain specific features. Materials and methods. The research uses the following methods: “Internet addiction scale” (Chen) (Chen Internet addiction Scale – CIAS), adapted by V.L. Malygina, K.A. Feklisova; questionnaire “Adolescents about parents” (ADOR) E. Schafer, modified by Z. Mateychek, P. Richan, adapted by L.I. Wasserman, I.A. Gorkova and E.E. Romitsyna. The research was carried out in educational institutions of the Sverdlovsk region. The sample size is 167 adolescents (average age – 15.7 years, with S = 0.36). Research results. The results of the study confirm the existence of significantly significant differences in parent’s image among adolescents with Internet addiction and adolescents without a tendency to addictive behavior. The revealed differences are associated with the perception of the image of parents both from the content side, which includes the degree of approval, understanding, autonomy, and from the structural side, reflecting educational strategies, methods of upbringing and the attitude of parents. Thus, adolescents with Internet addiction believe that their mothers show less “positive interest” in the events of their lives than adolescents without Internet addiction (t = -9.06; at p <0.001); less often reproduce autonomy (t = -3.41; at p <0.001); more often inclined to directivity (t = 7.92; at p <0.001) and hostility (t = 8.68; at p <0.001), inconsistent in their educational influences (t = 4.12; at p <0.001). Adolescents with Internet addiction pay more attention to hostile and distant parental attitudes (t = 7.64; at p <0.001), focusing on the negative behavior of the adolescent (t = -6.82; at p <0.001); the educational strategy is perceived by adolescents as predominantly inconsistent (t = 2.23; at p <0.001) and directive (t = 4.50; at p <0.001). These differences, according to the authors, are associated with both the characteristics of the parent, as well as with the psychological properties of the personality, prone to addictive behavior. The scientific novelty of the research lies in the fact that in Russian psychology, for the first time, a study has been undertaken of the characteristics of the parent’s image in adolescents who differ in the degree of their propensity to Internet addiction."

However, in many developing countries women’s physical mobility is restricted by social norms, structural impediments related to poor quality of roads and transport systems, and security issues. Restrictions on female physical mobility and low levels of empowerment can also have negative implications for women’s access to healthcare services. Mobile phones could help connect women to information and social networks and thus also strengthen their bargaining power within the household. Here, we use nationally representative data from 39,523 women in India collected in 2011-12 to analyse associations between women’s use of mobile phones and selected indicators of female autonomy and empowerment. Results indicate that women’s mobile phone use is positively associated with their physical mobility range and use of non-surgical contraceptives, whereas it is negatively associated with surgical contraceptive methods. We also analyse to what extent these associations are influenced by other socioeconomic and cultural factors. Our findings suggest that mobile phones can play an important positive role for women’s empowerment in India."

Bandini \n Aviva Must \n Jessica Pelletier \n Kate Ryan \n Carol Curtin \nQuality of life (QOL) is lower for transition-age autistic youth compared to typically developing counterparts. Leisure-time pursuits have been linked to higher quality of life in the general population and among autistic adults. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore leisure-time use among transition-age autistic youth. Youth ages 18–23 years were recruited through universities and organizations that serve the autistic population and their families across the United States. Participants took photos of their leisure-time activities over a 7-day period using their own smartphones. They were then interviewed via Zoom using a semi-structured interview guide that was based on the Self-Determination Theory framework and the Iwasaki leisure-time model. Data were analyzed using directed qualitative content analysis based on the theoretical framework. Eighteen young autistic adults participated in the study (nine male, five female, three agender/non-binary, and one transgender). Solitary, screen-based activities were most common. Major themes were that activities contributed positively to a sense of achievement and a sense of autonomy, and there were few major barriers to favored activities. While most activities were done alone, rather than describing these activities as isolating, activities helped participants cope with stress. Participants gained a sense of connection when they were engaged in leisure activities with others who shared common interests. Results suggest that appropriate interventions may support youth in choosing activities they most enjoy, even if they appear to be solitary or sedentary, and to help ensure that youth are gaining maximal benefits from these activities. • Few studies have examined leisure-time use among transition-age autistic youth. • Youth effectively shared experiences using participant-driven photo-elicitation. • Results suggest leisure activities contribute to well-being."

Therefore, this study aims to assess the students’ perspective on online learning classes carried out during the lockdown in 2020. The analysis is based on 2,107 valid answers from students of seven Portuguese higher education institutions that took synchronous online classes. Principal component analysis and binary logistic regression were the main quantitative methods used. This study identified five factors that, in all cases, significantly explain the students’ perspective on the transition to online classes. These factors include not only pedagogical matters (teachers’ overall quality) but also elements related to personal or motivational students’ characteristics (performance and autonomy; constraints and obstacles to socialization; self-confidence while attending online classes) and technological issues (Internet access conditions). Notwithstanding, self-confidence is not a relevant factor for students that had technical limitations in what concerns infrastructural matters. Therefore, besides confirming the factors behind the success of online classes, this research is relevant for highlighting the need to assure that students have the proper conditions regarding technical infrastructures to improve the overall quality of online classes.

During this age, the capabilities of individuals and societies to access and use multiple forms of convergent media content got enhanced manifold. It also led to a revolution in the industry of ‘news and views’. This convergent media is popularly known as the ‘New Media’. While this new (digital) media is taking new shapes across the globe, it is still struggling for survival in one part of the world called Kashmir. Due to frequent suspensions of internet service in the valley, the digital media of Kashmir faces multiple challenges that are mostly unknown to other parts of the world. During 2010, 2012 and 2016 uprisings in Kashmir and more recently in 2019–2020, when Indian government decided to scrap the autonomy and special status of the valley, this place was excluded digitally that had a huge setback not only to the growth of New Media, but on education, health and economy as well. This paper studies this digital exclusion and its impact on journalism and mass communication in Kashmir."

Rivera \n Miguel Jiménez \n Gabriel Tamura \n Norha M. Villegas \n Hausi A. Müller \nThe proliferation of Smart Cyber-Physical Systems (SCPS) is increasingly blurring the boundaries between physical and virtual entities. This trend is revolutionizing multiple application domains along the whole human activity spectrum, while pushing the growth of new businesses and innovations such as smart manufacturing, cities and transportation systems, as well as personalized healthcare. Technological advances in the Internet of Things, Big Data, Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence have effected tremendous progress toward the autonomic control of SCPS operations. However, the inherently dynamic nature of physical environments challenges SCPS’ ability to perform adequate control actions over managed physical assets in myriad of contexts. From a design perspective, this issue is related to the system states of operation that cannot be predicted entirely at design time, and the consequential need to define adequate capabilities for run-time self-adaptation and self-evolution. Nevertheless, adaptation and evolution actions must be assessed before realizing them in the managed system in order to ensure resiliency while minimizing the risks. Therefore, the design of SCPS must address not only dependable autonomy but also operational resiliency. In light of this, the contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we propose a reference architecture for designing dependable and resilient SCPS that integrates concepts from the research areas of Digital Twin, Adaptive Control and Autonomic Computing. Second, we propose a model identification mechanism for guiding self-evolution, based on continuous experimentation, evolutionary optimization and dynamic simulation, as the architecture’s first major component for dependable autonomy. Third, we propose an adjustment mechanism for self-adaptation, based on gradient descent, as the architecture’s second major component, addressing operational resiliency. Our contributions aim to further advance the research of reliable self-adaptation and self-evolution mechanisms and their inclusion in the design of SCPS. Finally, we evaluate our contributions by implementing prototypes and showing their viability using real data from a case study in the domain of intelligent transportation systems."

This observation becomes particularly important in the age of ubiquitous computing and the increasing adoption of AI in everyday communication infrastructures. We apply Nicholas Garnham’s conceptual perspective on mediation to users who are challenged both individually and societally when interacting with AI-enabled systems. One way to increase user agency are mechanisms to contest faulty or flawed AI systems and their decisions, as well as to request redress. Currently, however, users structurally lack such mechanisms, which increases risks for vulnerable communities, for instance patients interacting with AI healthcare chatbots. To empower users in AI-mediated communication processes, this article introduces the concept of active human agency. We link our concept to contestability and redress mechanism examples and explain why these are necessary to strengthen active human agency. We argue that AI policy should introduce rights for users to swiftly contest or rectify an AI-enabled decision. This right would empower individual autonomy and strengthen fundamental rights in the digital age. We conclude by identifying routes for future theoretical and empirical research on active human agency in times of ubiquitous AI."

In 2020, many countries endorsed lockdown measures, closed their borders, and practiced social distancing in a bid to contain COVID-19. These moves, however, disrupted global production and supply chains; no economic sector remained fully intact. The pandemic has exposed the vulnerability of supply chains in a globalized world, perhaps none more so than those linked to the distribution of essential raw materials. Minerals are considered raw materials, the extraction of which has important implications for a country’s sovereignty and economic autonomy. They are found in abundance in consumer goods such as smartphones, cell phone batteries, computer monitors, cards, and other electrical and electronic products whose useful life has ended. In response to the health and economic problems arising from the current crisis, several countries have moved ahead and outlined post-COVID-19 strategies for the supply of critical metals, over the medium and long term, to reduce their dependence on other states for these commodities. This paper reflects critically on the positioning of the world’s large economies, in the face of the COVID-19 crisis, on strategic minerals."

Integrating theories of human motivation, stress, and humane work design, we investigated whether different types of action regulation hindrances (ARH) pertaining to human (ICT competence deficits), technology (technical problems), interaction (coordination difficulties), and task aspects (work overload) related to technostress (H1). Furthermore, we examined if this relationship was mediated by satisfaction of the basic human needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness (H2). Our analysis of causes and mechanisms of technostress is based on cross-sectional survey data (self-report) from 205 psychology students attending an organizational psychology class that was switched from an in-person to an online format due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Structural equation modeling revealed that different types of ARH (i.e., ICT competence deficits, technical problems, coordination difficulties, work overload) positively predicted technostress (β = .17 to β = .42, p < .05). The effects were (partially) mediated by satisfaction of the need for autonomy (β = .11 to β = .15, p < .05), for all ARH except technical problems (β = .01, p = .86). We discuss implications for online course planning, technostress prevention as well as potential interventions beyond pandemic times."

With recent news on the metaverse and the AR cloud, the contexts in which the technology is used become more and more ubiquitous. This is problematic, since AR requires various different sensors gathering real-time, context-specific personal information about the users, causing more severe and new privacy threats compared to other technologies. These threats can have adverse consequences on information self-determination and the freedom of choice and, thus, need to be investigated as long as AR is still shapeable. This communication paper takes on a bird’s eye perspective and considers the ethical concept of autonomy as the core principle to derive recommendations and measures to ensure autonomy. These principles are supposed to guide future work on AR suggested in this article, which is strongly needed in order to end up with privacy-friendly AR technologies in the future."

Consequently, concerns are consistently raised about potential negative impacts on their mental health. Potentially, these concerns minimise their autonomy and reify the construction of the vulnerable adolescent. Using template analysis, we explored adolescents’ perspectives ( N = 54) of the relationship between social media and mental health. We centrally considered the wide array of uses made of different social media by the participants, focusing on their understandings of the potentially positive effects these might have. Focus group discussions showed social media could be used to reduce stress, have value for social connectivity, were an important source of information about mental health, and provided a platform for peer-to-peer support. Our conclusion indicated adolescents are generally socially competent online and are often experimenting with their emergent sense of agency."

Teunissen \n Walter J. Eppich \nABSTRACT Background The challenge of graduate medical education is to prepare physicians for unsupervised practice while ensuring patient safety. Current approaches may inadequately prepare physicians due to limited opportunities for autonomy. Recent work on how trainees gain autonomy shows that they actively influence their supervisors’ entrustment decisions. If program directors more clearly understand how trainees experience increasing independence, they may better sensitize trainees to the deliberations they will face during patient care. Objective The authors sought to explore how trainees experience lessening supervision as their clinical training advances. Methods Using constructivist grounded theory, the authors recruited trainees from various specialties and training levels via email and conducted 17 semi-structured interviews from 2019 to 2020 to solicit clinical experiences during which their perceived autonomy changed. Through constant comparison and iterative analysis, key themes and conceptual relationships were identified. Results Seventeen trainees from 4 specialties described novel clinical situations that required “overextending,” or going beyond their perceived edge of evolving expertise. This move represented a spectrum based on perceived locus of control, from deliberate overextending driven by trainees, to forced overextending driven by external factors. Trainee judgments about whether or not to overextend were distilled into key questions: (1) Can I do it? (2) Must I do it? (3) Do I want to do it? and (4) Is it safe to do it? More advanced trainees posed a fifth question: (5) Am I missing something? Conclusions Decisions to move into the realm of uncertainty about capabilities carried weight for trainees. In making deliberative judgments about overextending, they attempted to balance training needs, capability, urgency, and patient safety."

Siason Jr. \nThe aim of this study is to describe the experience of Higher Education Institution (HEI) faculty members on transactional distance in the context of a flexible educational landscape during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data gathered from eight (8) participants who have been teaching in a state college since the start of the pandemic. A common meaning of distance emerged from the analysis and was revealed through three different aspects wherein the variables of the Transactional Distance Theory (TDT) are concerned predominantly: i. dialogue (difficulty in communication and interaction), ii. structure (issues on participation due to intermittent internet connectivity), and iii. learner autonomy (poor performance in assessment results). These variables in TDT prompted the exemplification of cybergogy and heutagogy in a flexible educational landscape from the descriptions of teachers. Responding to the sense of distance, teaching reflected upon the opportunity in sharing current practice to foster flexibility while employing a learning management system to accommodate learner needs. The findings were discussed and interpreted as an embodied experience originating from the passage of transactional distance continually affecting faculty members’ life fundamental transition to a changed pedagogical space that is reflected in their experience of teaching amidst the constraints brought by the pandemic."

    "text": "Doc 1675 :  College Vocal Music Teaching Design Based on Internet Platform \nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2022/3590597\n Meng-Meng Tang \nInternet has penetrated into people’s lives as the Internet education platform has faced many changes in the way vocal music is taught in the new situation. The teaching methods set up on the Internet have also undergone dramatic changes. A number of advanced music education concepts have emerged that require a careful review of the current state of music education in the world and in China. Current online learning environments are usually used only for formal or informal learning. The former overemphasizes the subjective role of the teacher and ignores the autonomy of the learner. Through a new modern network education method, this paper deeply analyzes the unique advantages and existing problems of a new voice education method based on the Internet and puts forward corresponding solutions. Its purpose is to encourage more ordinary vocal music teachers to better understand the new teaching methods, broaden their artistic horizons, consciously use modern teaching methods to support vocal music education in ordinary schools, and further expand the scope of music application. The experimental results show that for 4000 concurrent users, the response time of the system is less than 5 seconds, which can meet the time requirements of the system. For the service of querying some other data, the response time of the system is less than 9 seconds, so the response ability of the system to multiple users is impressive. Therefore, with the development of education, comprehensive network education platform is also the development direction of informatization in the future."

I argue from the position that for one to enjoy privacy, one must be able to effectively exercise autonomous action. I offer in this paper a survey of the many ways in which persons autonomy is severely limited due to a variety of privacy invasions that come not only through the use of modern technological apparatuses, but as well simply by existing in an advanced technological society. I conclude that regarding the majority of persons whose privacy is violated, such a violations are actually initiated and upheld by the users of modern technology themselves, and that ultimately, most disruptions of privacy that occur are self-levied."

A smartphone or a mobile device that has been created as complex as possible to be multi-functional, can function as a mobile phone, as access to news, online games and so on. So that young people in the village, even even ua people are neglected because of it, so as to result in a rural identity gradually experiencing degradation or decline. The research method used is by means of observation, directly observing phenomena in the field and also combining them with data collected from various literature related to rural sociology. The results of these findings show, in fact there is something that needs to be taken care of behind the entry of digitalization of rural communities in Aceh, even though the rationality of this technology cannot be bent, it can be conditioned by maintaining tradition, village autonomy and village values amidst the impact of digitalization."

Frequently, researchers seek parent perspectives for understanding Autistic children’s preferences, while to date insufficient attention has been paid to Autistic adults as valuable informants on the Autistic experience of Autistic children. The objective of the study was to understand Autistic adult perspectives on pediatric occupational therapy for Autistic children. We sought and thematically analyzed data from a large Facebook group and an occupational therapy podcast on Autistic values, needs, and experiences in pediatric occupational therapy. Participants described wanting therapy that supported Autistic identities rather than trying to “fix” children, changing environments or tasks to promote participation, and setting goals that address self-advocacy and autonomy. Occupational therapy practitioners should critically reflect on their practice’s alignment with Autistic values and start to shift their practice as needed."

The study is designed as a systematic review. ITE-related 67 documents published by UN, EU, and OECD were analyzed following several coding steps. According to the results, international institutions promote entrepreneurship, life-long learning, and information and communication technologies as economic issues in ITE. As political issues, they put forward social themes including preparing for diversity, quality in ITE including accountability and standards, and structure of ITE including flexibility and autonomy. Although the documents are mainly parallel with the consensus approach, economic and political issues revealed in the study were discussed from perspectives of both approaches. One perspective considers promoting the economic issues in ITE the economic efficiency and growth which is beneficial for all. The other reminds that division of this benefit may include class-based inequalities. Also, different perspectives emphasize different social themes and they bring different explanations for how the quality assurance functions."

However, high-quality listening that conveys well-meaning attention and understanding when speakers discuss social rejection may help them to reconnect. Speakers may experience less loneliness because they feel close and connected (relatedness) to the listener and because listening supports self-congruent expression (autonomy). Five experiments (total N = 1,643) manipulated listening during visualized (Studies 1, 4, 5) and actual (Studies 2, 3) conversations. We used different methods (video vignettes; in-person; computer-mediated; recall; written scenarios) to compare high-quality with regular (all studies) and poor (Study 1) listening. Findings across studies showed that high-quality listening reduced speakers’ state loneliness after they shared past experiences of social rejection. Parallel mediation analyses indicated that both feeling related to the listener and autonomy satisfaction (particularly its self-congruence component; Study 5) mediated the effect of listening on loneliness. These results provide novel insights into the hitherto unexplored effect of listening on state loneliness."

Instagram influencers, empowered by the digital medium, would seem to be in direct competition with lifestyle journalists in terms of content.

Drawing on adaptive structuration theory for individuals (ASTI), this study investigates the antecedents (i.e. characteristics of MICT) and outcomes (i.e. employee affective and cognitive well-being) of routine MICT use in the remote work context. Design/methodology/approach The research model was empirically tested via a survey of 430 working professionals who use personal MICT for work purposes in the remote work context. Findings Results show that the routine MICT use increases employee affective well-being (i.e. job satisfaction) and mitigates cognitive well-being (i.e. technology overload). The mediation effects of routine MICT use on the relationships between its characteristics (autonomy and timeliness) and employee well-being (i.e. job satisfaction and technology overload) were also found. Originality/value Existing research on remote work has widely focused on employee productivity and performance, while attention has rarely been paid to the effects of the technology-driven “new normal” on employee well-being. Grounded in ASTI, this study identifies three MICT characteristics as sources of user adaptive structuration, which impact employees’ routine MICT use behavior and further influence employee affective and cognitive well-being. This research can help understand employees’ personal MICT use adaptive behavior and improve their well-being."

The purpose of the article is to determine the pedagogical conditions for the organization of the educational process in higher educational institution with specific studying conditions in terms of martial law throughout Ukraine. Methodology of the article. Consideration of the peculiarities of the organization of the educational process in higher educational institutions with specific studying conditions. It is revealed that in terms of martial law, there is a need to introduce pedagogical conditions to address issues related to: limiting opportunities for the use of information and communicative technologies in the educational process while the absence of the Internet and mobile communications; ensuring timely completion of course and qualification papers by all applicants for higher education; conducting group classes that provide for the circulation of language information with limited access; involving scientific and pedagogical workers and cadets in scientific work. It is highlighted that the normative legal acts regulating the educational process provide general recommendations for ensuring two-way communication between the subjects of the educational process in a higher educational institution. The effectiveness of the introduction of pedagogical conditions related to the organization of the educational process in terms of martial law has been demonstrated, on the example of the Academy of the State Penitentiary Service. The educational process is represented through a system of scientific and methodological and pedagogical measures that have proven their worth in terms of martial law. Results. The analysis of normative legal acts regulating the activity of higher educational institutions contributed to the highlighting of the peculiarities of the organization of the educational process in the terms of martial law. It is proved that in terms of martial law the organization of the educational process is significantly influenced by factors caused by difficulties in using informative and communicative technologies for group classes, setting educational tasks that require additional sources in a special library, ensuring academic integrity, effective development of general and special (professional) competencies. Practical significance of the obtained results is that they contribute to choosing the pedagogical conditions that promote the organization of the educational process in higher educational institutions with specific studying conditions in terms martial law. Key words: autonomy of higher educational institution, pedagogical conditions, individual schedule, informative and communicative technologies, academic disciplines."

In particular, the construction industry has been facing labor shortages and aging workforces for years, and the eruption of coronavirus disease 2019 has exacerbated the problem. In contrast, the food delivery business has grown rapidly during the pandemic with a surge in the number of food delivery knights. It is vitally important to understand the employment psychology of the young migrant workers, the main component of the workforce for both industries. The presented study conducted a comparative analysis between construction workers and food delivery knights using data from face-to-face interviews, online social media, and World Value Survey. Results showed that the two groups of young migrant workers have different employment psychology during their job selection, construction workers cared more about income, and food delivery knights paid more attention to autonomy, working environment, and family."

This method encourages students to be actively involved in the learning process, organize themselves, recognize their capabilities, and take the initiative to decide the appropriate way to achieve the learning achievement. The use of self-regulated learning with smartphones’ assistance has had a double effect on students’ language proficiency. However, the self-regulated learning method with smartphone assistance in the speaking class has not been supported by current empirical studies. The evidence indicates that self-regulated learning with smartphones’ assistance affects students’ English skills, such as acuity in micro-and macro-linguistics analysis, improved digital literacy, enthusiasm for learning, and self-potential development autonomy. This study aimed to analyze the impact of using the self-regulated learning method with smartphones in the speaking class. This review is a quantitative study with a pre-test and post-test design that was executed between October 2020 until January 2021. 110 students were chosen as samples in this study. An English-speaking rubric has been used to obtain data; that data was then analyzed by a software application that is SPSS 24.0, which was proceeded by qualitative description. The findings demonstrate that using a self-regulated learning method with smartphone assistance has positively impacted student speaking ability. This increased effect is demonstrated by the adjusted mean score on the post-test = 82.32. English instructors are encouraged to apply this method by considering students’ characteristics, cognitive capacities, learning styles, learner autonomy, and the steps of how to apply this method in the instruction process."

Chatbots can provide great opportunities in education. The use of chatbots in education can be used to employ interactive methods, to provide learners information and different types of info, and to guide learners. Indeed, chatbots promise to enhance learning experiences by creating more interaction than traditional teaching practices provide. In this context, the purpose of this study is to apply chatbot technology as a guidance tool in educational environments and to model its effects on visual design self-efficacy, engagement, satisfaction, and learner autonomy at the end of the process. The participants of the study are 86 university students. In this study, data were collected with 4 different scales. Data were analyzed using the variance-based structural equation model with the partial least square method. As a result of the study, it was found that students with higher chatbot usage satisfaction had higher visual design self-efficacy. Chatbot usage satisfaction positively affects some aspects of course satisfaction. Chatbot usage satisfaction affects engagement. The effects of the study results in terms of research and practice were discussed."

The growth of the platform economy has attracted considerable attention in recent years. As yet, however, research has focused almost exclusively on labour platforms that operate to match the supply of and demand for paid work in fields such as food delivery, ride hailing, cleaning or data entry activities. Surprisingly little is known about work and its manifestations on other platforms, despite the fact that the platform economy embraces a huge variety of arrangements for income generation. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 18 German (video)bloggers we show that (video)blogging constitutes a specific form of ‘digital self-employment’ that combines features of traditional self-employment with digitally mediated dependencies. While (video)bloggers enjoy both a great deal of independence from managerial control and a high degree of autonomy, they are also subject to the rules and algorithms set by large tech companies. The example of (video)blogging, together with the experiences of (video)bloggers, highlights the extent to which the platform economy has created new types of work that need to be taken into consideration to enable a deeper understanding of the evolving dynamics of the platform economy and how these are transforming the nature of work."

The majority overcomes these developmental tasks, but a substantial proportion of youth develops problematic usage patterns (e.g., of video games) or problematic consumption behavior (e.g., of alcohol). Empirical findings show the importance of family aspects for these problematic behavior patterns. Currently, it is not clear which specific areas of parent-child relationship are associated in each case and whether there are differences between substance-related and substance-unrelated problematic behavioral patterns.We surveyed 480 adolescents (45.2% females, mean age = 16.84 years) with standardized instruments regarding the mother-child relationship as well as problematic gaming, problematic social media use, and problematic alcohol use. We conducted correlation and multiple linear regression analyses (separately for problematic gaming, problematic social media use, and problematic alcohol use) as well as a multivariate multiple regression analysis.In the regression analyses, more conflicts with the mother were related to all three behavioral patterns. However, lower cohesion was only statistically significantly associated with problematic alcohol use, but not with problematic gaming and problematic social media use, whereas lower autonomy and more frequent punishment of the child were statistically significantly related to problematic gaming and problematic social media use, but not to problematic alcohol use.The findings indicate partially different relational dynamics for substance-related and substance-unrelated problem behaviors (interestingly, for cohesion and autonomy, the 95% confidence intervals of the standardized regression coefficients were not overlapping). The results of the present study could be used in family-based prevention approaches or in treatments in the clinical setting."

This study analyzed how need satisfaction and frustration relate to the severity of gambling and gaming problems.A survey study with 18-75-year-old Finnish participants (N = 1530; 50.33% male) was conducted in April 2021. Basic psychological needs were measured with the Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction and Frustration Scale, mental health issues with the five-item Mental Health Inventory, gambling problems with the Problem Gambling Severity Index, and gaming problems with the Internet Gaming Disorder Test. Zero-inflated negative binomial analyses were conducted to examine how satisfaction and frustration of basic psychological needs, together with mental health issues, are associated with gaming and gambling problems.Mental health issues were associated with gambling and gaming problems, but this association became nonsignificant when basic psychological needs were added to the model. However, better mental health still was associated with the absence of gaming problems. While need satisfaction had no association with the absence of gaming or gambling problems, need frustration was associated with increases in the severity of both gaming and gambling problems.Frustration of basic psychological needs for autonomy, relatedness, and competence is associated with both gambling and gaming problems and should be considered when developing treatment and support for those who experience such problems."

The objective of this study is to know the integration process of Digital Technologies of Information and Communication (DTIC), facilities and limits perceived by professors of an undergraduate course in Nursing. Methods. Descriptive and exploratory study, with a qualitative approach, carried out in 2018, with nine professors from an undergraduate Nursing course at a public university located in the interior of Ceará. For the data production process, semi-structured interviews were conducted and content analysis was carried out. Results. DTIC have been integrated into teaching practices from different perspectives, in theoretical and practical activities, using mobile practice simulation applications, social networks, links to websites, WhatsApp® groups and video-lessons. Furthermore, the integration of these technologies increases the creation of strategies that promote the active participation of the student, offering spaces for reflection, autonomy, as well as the development of creativity and collaboration. Teachers highlight interactivity and communication, access to resources that are not available at the University, such as anatomical models, simulators of nursing procedures. Among the limits, structural issues, access to the internet, absence of institutional policies and permanent education are factors that demand greater attention for an effective pedagogical integration of DTIC. Conclusion. Although it represents an initial process of use, there is a potential for continuity and expansion of DTIC in different environments and disciplines. Efforts have been undertaken by teachers to integrate these technologies into the context of pedagogical activities in the Nursing course."

This study aims to investigate ESP teachers’ and students’ perceptions of integrating Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in ESP instruction to solve traditional ESP instruction problems in Iran.\n \n Methodology: This concurrent parallel mixed method study investigated students’ and teachers’ perceptions of solving ESP instruction problems through ICT. The sample concluded 300 undergraduate engineering students and 24 experienced and novice ESP teachers. In the quantitative phase of the study, data were collected through two adapted questionnaires. In the qualitative phase, data were obtained from interviews with 12 undergraduate students, three experienced, and three novice ESP teachers.\n \n Findings: The findings revealed that the participants had positive perceptions of integrating different ICT tools for solving the problems with traditional ESP materials and methods, problems with low language skills, lack of autonomy, demotivation problem, inactivity problem, and problems with lack of exposure to real-life situations. The findings also showed that integrating different ICT tools and ICT-based interactive activities promote students’ communication skills subconsciously through experiencing direct participation in communications.\n \n Conclusion and Contributions:he findings might contribute significantly to change the ESP instruction status quo in Iran, which is not based on the ESP students’ communication needs, and replace it with innovative approaches to meet the needs of the modern ESP student. The results also provide a unique outlook of promoting ESP instruction in tertiary education by integrating ICTs through divergent stakeholder perceptions.\n \n Keywords: English for Specific Purposes (ESP), Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Perception, Promoting English for Specific Purposes instruction\n \n Cite as: Keshtiarast, B., Salehi, H., Tabatabaei, O., & Baharlooie, R.

In this article we will talk about the emotional needs of the teenagers, related to the online environment and we will consider both constructive behavior and what parents should avoid in their relationship to their children. Teenagers’ connection to their own emotional needs (safety, belonging, empathy and honesty, autonomy, trust, spontaneity, etc.) as well as the involvement of the parents in gratifying them reflects in the degree of vitality and well-being of the child. Apart from the undeniable benefits, the development of the technology and the accessibility of the online environment also draw undesirable consequences which can lead to major damage of psychic, social and school functioning. It is essential for the parents to be present in their teenagers’ life, be available and informed about the age characteristics, internet traps, ways of preventing the risks in the online, influencing and maintaining their children’s excitement and joy, as well as spontaneity and innocence."

Yet, the support for online learning seems inadequate to address students’ diverse online learning needs and may impede the inclusiveness in higher education. Therefore, based on a questionnaire administered to higher education students in Sri Lanka, this paper examines the support or lack of support students have experienced during the university closure that may enable or hinder inclusive online learning. It draws on Self-Determination Theory (SDT) as a theoretical lens to analyse and make sense of these enablers for and barriers to inclusive online higher education. The key findings suggest that students first need autonomy support to access stable and affordable internet and devices, and quality online learning resources. They also need competence support for monitoring and managing their own learning through feedback and scaffolding as they engage in their learning online. Finally, they need relatedness support for reducing their anxiety and having a sense of connectedness by interacting and communicating with teachers and students."

In particular, public trust is essential for personal data use, as demonstrated in debates in many countries, for example, about whether data from COVID-19 contact tracing apps should be pooled or remain on individuals’ smartphones. Low levels of public trust pose a risk not only to health system legitimacy but can also harm population health.Synthesising our previous qualitative and theoretical research in the English National Health Service which enabled us to conceptualise the nature of public trust in health systems, we present guiding principles designed to rebuild public trust, if lost, and to maintain high levels of public trust in personal data use within the health system, if not.To build public trust, health system actors need to not rush trust building; engage with the public; keep the public safe; offer autonomy to the public; plan for diverse trust relationships; recognise that trust is shaped by both emotion and rational thought; represent the public interest; and work towards realising a net benefit for the health system and the public.Beyond policymakers and government officials, the guiding principles address a wide range of actors within health systems so that they can work collectively to build public trust. The guiding principles can be used to inform policymaking in health and health care and to analyse the performance of different governments to see if those governments that operate in greater conformity with the guiding principles perform better."

Similarly, the use of smartphones and other information and communication technologies (ICTs) in organizations also affords workers advantages, such as increased flexibility, while exposing them to risks such as exhaustion and distress. This research examines older workers’ smartphone use and identifies a contextual characteristic that may buffer the negative implications of smartphone use for work purposes. Following the job demands–resources (JD-R) model, we hypothesized that older workers’ daily work-related smartphone use is positively related to their experienced stress and negatively related to their mood, and that these relationships would be attenuated by work scheduling autonomy. We conducted an experience sampling method (ESM) study with a sample of 38 workers (ages 50–64) who completed daily measures over 8 days, and tracked their smartphone use objectively using screenshots of time spent using various apps. Contrary to our expectations, smartphone use was not significantly related to stress or mood. There were significant cross-level interactions, such that smartphone use for work was negatively related to experienced stress and positively related to a positive mood for those with lower levels of scheduling autonomy. We interpret these findings and discuss the effects that technology use for work may have on older workers’ well-being through the lens of the JD-R model. Our results suggest that ICT use in the workplace combined with work scheduling autonomy may not be advantageous for workers’ well-being."

Bulilawa \n Joey D. Jabonete, EdD \n Rafunzel Bulilawa EdD \nPhysical Education is rooted in physical movement and exploration and is usually held outdoors to make teaching and learning more accessible and meaningful. Since the pandemic happened, schools adopt a new teaching-learning modality which create new host of obstacles for Physical Education teachers, especially in teaching practical skills in Physical Education to the students due to its characteristics. This becomes now challenging to monitor students’ progress in performing the skills or whether students have acquired/performed the skills correctly. This study aims to explore the strategies and techniques in the teaching of practical skills in Physical Education in the new normal. This study also identifies the effectiveness and hindrances of the strategies and techniques used. The findings of this study serve as a basis in formulating a framework for enriching contemporary curriculum discourse in physical education of senior high public schools in Tagbilaran City during the school year 2020-2021. Physical Education teachers used a variety of ways in the new normal to effectively teach practical skills in Physical Education, rather than depending solely on printed modular instruction. In teaching the practical skills, task teaching and students submitting video performances were employed. Because of the nature of modular distance learning, students’ autonomy for learning is one of the contributing elements to the difficulty of teaching practical skills in physical education. Many students have not yet established sufficient learning autonomy, resulting in learning gaps and preventing them from developing practical skills in physical education. Adding to that is the lack of needed resources such as gadgets and poor internet connections."

Shaffer \n Xiaoxia Zhu \nThe workplace in the 21st century has changed dramatically, as the internet connected the world, the “gig economy” changed work arrangements, globalization expanded the job market and individual work values such as autonomy and freedom became dominant (Rabenu, 2021). Just a few years ago, automation and technology were the heart of the conversation on the modern workplace and seemed to be replacing meaningful human connections. However, the COVID-19 pandemic, that required social distancing, demonstrated just how much people still need each other, and how technology cannot replace human relationships. The Positive Organizational Scholarship (POS) movement that started in the early 2000’s seeks to understand the role of positive relationships at work. The place of work in our lives makes it a source of meaning, purpose and identity-building, that are often created through positive relationships (Ragins & Dutton, 2007). For example, high-quality relationships enable human flourishing that in turn benefits the organization (Dutton & Heaphy, 2003). Another notable outcome of the movement is the Reflected Best Self Exercise (Quinn, Dutton, Spreitzer, & Roberts, 2003) that helps understand individual strengths through feedback from significant others. The purpose of this symposium is to contribute to understanding the role of positive relationships in the workplace. This collection of papers explores different types of work relationships with leaders, coworkers and work friends to examine how positive emotional connections help overcome challenges and promote well-being. By looking at processes on different levels of analysis, this symposium offers a broader perspective on workplace relations and unique roles they can play for employees and for organizations.

The position is less clear for an interdependent Autonomous Human Machine Team System (A-HMT-S) which achieves its aim by reallocating tasks and resources between the human Team Leader and the Cyber Physical System (CPS). A-HMT-S are now feasible and may be the only solution for complex problems. However, legal authorities presume that humans are ultimately responsible for the actions of any automated system, including ones using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to replace human judgement. The concept of trust for an A-HMT-S using AI is examined in this paper with three critical questions being posed which must be addressed before an A-HMT-S can be trusted. A hierarchical system architecture is used to answer these questions, combined with a method to limit a node’s behaviour, ensuring actions requiring human judgement are referred to the user. The underpinning issues requiring Research and Development (R&amp;D) for A-HMT-S applications are identified and where legal input is required to minimize financial and legal risk for all stakeholders. This work takes a step towards addressing the problems of developing autonomy for interdependent human-machine teams and systems."

Fábián \n Ilona Huszti \n Erzsébet Bárány \n Ilona Lechner \nAbstract. Introduction. The school breakdown in spring 2020 made both teachers and learners all overthe world face new challenges: how to cope with distance learning (DL). It was not simple even in the welldeveloped countries. In Ukraine teachers tried to find different solutions. This period was a sudden but hugestep towards implementing ICT into the learning process. Purpose. The aim of the present study was to get aninsight into the way learners see distance learning, to hear their opinion and see their attidude to this form ofeducation, the difficulties and challenges they encountered during this period in the learning process in generaland in foreign language (FL) learning in particular. The focus was made on the learning habits, motivation,assessment, applications used, time spent on learning and stress students might have experienced. Methods.An online questionnaire containing closed-ended and open-ended questions was compiled and filled in bylearners of the upper grades of different schools. The data analysis was interpretive and statistical. Results.The material was sent mainly in the form of written text or video links and recordings via Messenger, emailor Google Classroom, very few online lessons were held. Most learners had difficulties; the most problematicarea in FL learning was grammar. Feedback and assessment were mainly in written form. The attitude tolearning was quite serious, learners developed their digital skills but some became demotivated. It was moretime-consuming, more difficult but less stressful and also less effective than face-to-face learning. Conclusion.Despite all the difficulties faced learners developed learner autonomy, digital skills and gained experience ina new form of learning that can be useful for them in their future studies as in the digital age DL is gainingground worldwide."

    "text": "Doc 1703 :  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICAL PRACTICE: REGULATIVE ISSUES AND PERSPECTIVES. \nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33611272/\n No Author Names \nThe aim of the research is to identify specific of AI in healthcare, its nature, and specifics and to establish complexities of AI implementation in healthcare and to propose ways to eliminate them.Materials and methods: This study was conducted during June-October of 2020. Through a broad literature review, analysis of EU, USA regulation acts, scientific researches and opinions of progressive-minded people in this sphere this paper provide a guide to understanding the essence of AI in healthcare and specifics of its regulation. It is based on dialectical, comparative, analytic, synthetic and comprehensive methods.Results: One of the first broad definitions of AI sounded like “Artificial Intelligence is the study of ideas which enable computers to do the things that make people seem intelligent … The central goals of Artificial Intelligence are to make computers more useful and to understand the principles which make intelligence possible.” There are two approaches to name this technology - “Artificial intelligence” and “Augmented Intelligence.” We prefer to use a more common category of “Artificial intelligence” rather than “Augmented Intelligence” because the last one, from our point of view, leaves much space for “human supervision” meaning, and that will limit the sense of AI while it will undoubtedly develop in future. AI in current practice is interpreted in three forms, they are: AI as a simple electronic tool without any level of autonomy (like electronic assistant, “calculator”), AI as an entity with some level of autonomy, but under human control, and AI as an entity with broad autonomy, substituting human’s activity wholly or partly, and we have to admit that the first one cannot be considered as AI at all in current conditions of science development. Description of AI often tends to operate with big technological products like DeepMind (by Google), Watson Health (by IBM), Healthcare’s Edison (by General Electric), but in fact, a lot of smaller technologies also use AI in the healthcare field - smartphone applications, wearable health devices and other examples of the Internet of Things. At the current stage of development AI in medical practice is existing in three technical forms: software, hardware, and mixed forms using three main scientific-statistical approaches - flowchart method, database method, and decision-making method. All of them are useable, but they are differently suiting for AI implementation. The main issues of AI implementation in healthcare are connected with the nature of technology in itself, complexities of legal support in terms of safety and efficiency, privacy, ethical and liability concerns.Conclusion: The conducted analysis makes it possible to admit a number of pros and cons in the field of AI using in healthcare. Undoubtedly this is a promising area with a lot of gaps and grey zones to fill in. Furthermore, the main challenge is not on technology itself, which is rapidly growing, evolving, and uncovering new areas of its use, but rather on the legal framework that is clearly lacking appropriate regulations and some political, ethical, and financial transformations. Thus, the core questions regarding is this technology by its nature is suitable for healthcare at all? Is the current legislative framework looking appropriate to regulate AI in terms of safety, efficiency, premarket, and postmarked monitoring? How the model of liability with connection to AI technology using in healthcare should be constructed? How to ensure privacy without the restriction of AI technology use? Should intellectual privacy rights prevail over public health concerns? Many questions to address in order to move in line with technology development and to get the benefits of its practical implementation."

Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) is considered highly effective for language learning as technology creates a student centered environment, increases learner autonomy, and results in higher learning outcomes. This study investigated if CALL using Web Based Instruction (WBI) as a tool is more beneficial than the traditional method for teaching English grammar to undergraduate students in Pakistan. An experimental design was followed to compare the effect of technology based and traditional method of teaching and a focus group interview was conducted to obtain the participants’ views about CALL. MANCOVA test was applied for the analysis of the pretest and posttest scores. Results showed that the experimental group performed significantly better than the control group. Additionally, the students exhibited a positive attitude towards technology based teaching. Based on these findings, integration of computers is recommended in English language teaching for improved learning."

This paper aims at reviewing and framing this issue along a double dichotomy. The first one addresses the discrepancy between users’ intentions and actions (1) under some algorithmic influence and (2) without it. The second one distinguishes algorithmic biases on (1) prior information rearrangement and (2) posterior information arrangement. In all cases, we focus on and differentiate situations where algorithms empirically appear to expand the cognitive and social horizon of users, from those where they seem to limit that horizon. We additionally suggest that these biases may not be properly appraised without taking into account the underlying social processes which algorithms are building upon."

Russell \n“No” is our answer to the question in our title. In moral psychology, a purity violation (defined as an immoral act committed against one’s own body or soul) was theorized to be a homogeneous moral domain qualitatively distinct from other moral domains. In contrast, we hypothesized heterogeneity rather than homogeneity, overlapping rather than distinct domains, and quantitative rather than qualitative differences from other hypothesized domains (specifically, autonomy, which is harm to others). Purity has been said to consist of norms violations of which elicit disgust and taint the soul. Here we empirically examined homogeneity: whether violations of body (e.g., eating putrid food) belong in the same moral domain as violations of the soul unrelated to bodily health (e.g., selling one’s soul, desecrating sacred books). We examined distinctness: whether reactions to purity violations differ in predicted ways from those to violations of autonomy. In four studies (the last preregistered), American Internet users (in Studies 2 and 4, classified as politically conservative or liberal; Ns = 80, 96, 1,312, 376) were given stories about violations based on prior studies. Nonhealth purity violations were rated as relatively more disgusting, but less gross (the lay term for the reaction to putrid things) and more likely to taint the soul than were health-related ones. Surprisingly, both health and nonhealth purity violations were typically judged as only slightly immoral if at all. Autonomy violations were rated as more disgusting and tainting of the soul than were purity violations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)."

However, much of the literature that explores these impacts fails to engage in depth with the philosophical literature on autonomy. This has resulted in a failure to consider the full range of impacts that social media might have on autonomy. A deeper consideration of these impacts is thus needed, given the importance of both autonomy as a moral concept and social media as a feature of contemporary life. By drawing on this philosophical literature, we argue that autonomy is broadly a matter of developing autonomy competencies, having authentic ends and control over key aspects of your own life, and not being manipulated, coerced, and controlled by others. We show how the autonomy of users of social media can be disrespected and harmed through the control that social media can have over its users’ data , attention , and behaviour . We conclude by discussing various recommendations to better regulate social media."

Internet promotes the reconfiguration and integration of educational resources. The Internet has greatly magnified the role and value of high-quality educational resources. Blended teaching combines the advantages of traditional teaching and network teaching to complement each other; it not only gives full play to the flexibility and autonomy of network teaching, but also retains the connection of teacher-student emotional communication in traditional teaching. Translation teaching is an important part of college English teaching. This article mainly introduces the research of college English translation (CET) blended teaching strategies under the Internet background. This paper proposes a research plan for CET blended teaching strategies under the Internet background, including literature research method, questionnaire survey method, analytic hierarchy process, expert interview method, teaching evaluation sentiment classification algorithm based on feature-weighted Stacking algorithm, and analytic hierarchy process of the teaching effect evaluation algorithm. The experimental results of this article show that the average value of the questionnaire Cronbach’s α coefficient is 0.915, demonstrating that the study’s information is both extremely plausible and reasonably real."

AMs bring strategies that promise a more dynamic class, with active participation of the student, placing them at the center of the learning process, which leads to more autonomy and responsibility. Theoretical contributions are from Discourse Analysis (DA), based on Foucault (1999), for the analysis of the meaning effects, emanating from the discourse. In the school context, the textbook acts as a form of power-knowledge, imposing regimes of truth. An analysis was made in a high school textbook of a public school, and a subtle use of AMs was observed. They appear as a hoax for traditional teaching, masquerading as liberating, fun and playful teaching. Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are placed as if they were easily accessible and familiar to students."

The mobile phone use and the psychological wellbeing of secondary school students has become an issue of interest for research. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between the time spent on mobile phone use and the psychological wellbeing of secondary school students in Nairobi County, Kenya. The study used an embedded mixed method research design. A Multistage sampling method was employed in selecting the 7 schools, and the sample size of 357 respondents. Data was collected using a questionnaire and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Pearson’s Product Moment Correlation Coefficients was used for data analysis. The main findings of this study showed a strong positive correlation between time spent on the use of mobile phones and the psychological wellbeing of secondary school students (0.885). The study also found out that there was a strong positive correlation between time spent on the mobile phones and the aspect of personal growth (0.985) and the self-acceptance (0.980). There was a moderate positive correlation between time spent on the use of mobile phones and the environmental mastery (0.60), the purpose in life (0.528) and the positive relations with others (0.457). There was a weak positive correlation between time spent on the use of mobile phones and the autonomy (0.004). The study recommends that the school administration should establish counselling facilities which can address the issues related to mobile phones use among secondary school students."

In particular, the use of surveillance programs that leverage data and tools from mobile phones have become important components of public health strategies to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 across the globe. Currently, big technology companies around the world are helping governments evaluate the effectiveness of their social distancing protocols by examining and analyzing movements of millions of mobile phone users in order to determine how the virus is spreading across the various geographic locations, and the effectiveness of the various social distancing methods that have been implemented. The collection and use of individual mobile phone data as a public health surveillance tool presents tensions between several ethical priorities. Such a dilemma resides in the tensions between public health ethics goals and clinical ethics goals. While public health ethics pursues goals that seek to ensure the good of the community, such goals are often achieved at the expense of clinical ethics goals which emphasize individual autonomy and civil liberty. In using persons’ mobile phone data as a tool to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, we must address the tensions associated with weighing the needs of “the many” with ensuring the rights of the individual."

This study employs a mixed-method research design, with the purpose of identifying the use of English language apps outside the classroom and depicting students’ English language apps use behaviour i.e. motivation from the Self-Determination Theory (SDT). The findings show that students use the apps related to grammar the most and followed by English apps related to speaking, reading and, vocabulary. Findings also reveal students in this study display three types of motivation from the perspective of SDT i.e. autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Based on the findings, a model of Pedagogical Considerations of Using Smartphone for English Language Learning (PCUSELL) is suggested. As a conclusion, the authors suggests that educators in higher educational institution educators should consider the potential of smartphone English apps in their teaching and learning activities, particularly in this new normal of teaching and learning i.e. epoch of the COVID-19 pandemic."

    "text": "Doc 1713 :  ANTI-CORRUPTION DIGITAL SOLUTIONS: THE UKRAINIAN EXPERIENCE AND THE PECULIARITIES OF THEIR IMPLEMENTATION IN A STATE OF WAR \nhttps://doi.org/10.17721/2616-9193.2022/16-2/7\n Nataliia Korchak \nThe purpose of the article is to highlight the innovative experience of implementation of digital transformation in Ukraine on the example of the National Agency for the Prevention of Corruption (hereinafter - NAPC). The content of the publication is due to the specifics of the subject of research and reflects an interdisciplinary approach to the disclosure of the topic. The article is a comprehensive study of the problems of digital transformation (digitalization) in terms of quantitative and qualitative changes in public administration and management. By the example of the organization of management in the NAPC, attention is focused on the directions of digital transformation and the components of the processes of digitalization of the subject of public administration are highlighted. It is noted that for the effective fight against corruption it is necessary not only to adopt high-quality anti-corruption legislation and create strong anti-corruption bodies, but also to develop/apply digital tools. NAPC became one of the first state agencies, which appointed an official for digital development, digital transformation and digitalization and is the leader in Ukraine in the implementation of anti-corruption digital solutions. It is argued that digitalization in public and governmental activities forms a qualitative characteristic of the system of public administration with the use of modern technologies, and digitalization of the National Agency is the key to the development of its institutional autonomy as a service organization. It is established that since the beginning of the war the NAPC has completely reformatted its work in the direction of providing interdepartmental communication of specialized bodies in joint projects. This is due to the high level of new digital skills and knowledge acquired in the pre-war period and the presence of a powerful team of analysts involved in collecting and processing the data needed to form proposals to the sanctions lists. The digital competence of the NAPC is implemented in the process of identifying individuals involved in the aggression against Ukraine. Thanks to the Task-force portal, assets of sanctioned persons are identified for their seizure in order to restore Ukraine. The War and Sanctions portal provides information on sanctioned individuals and data on the assets of individuals involved in Russia’s military aggression. The list of domestic collateral officials is formed through the maintenance of the Register of State Assignees. The implementation of the international IT tool RuAssets increases the efficiency of work to identify hidden Russian and Belarusian assets. It is noted and substantiated that the digitalization of NAPC covers both the automation of internal management processes and the introduction of modern information and communication technologies in the fight against corruption (in a peaceful period of development of the country) and the fierce struggle of the Ukrainian people against full-scale Russian aggression. The scientific novelty of the article is due to the fact that for the first time the various aspects of the implementation of digital solutions in the framework of digital transformation are reflected on the example of a state body. The practical significance of the article is associated with the possibility of further use of its materials in the educational process, conducting interdisciplinary research into the problems of digital state development and anti-corruption digital solutions and the formation of proposals for the use of innovative IT-technologies in the activities of public administrations."

Multilevel models were used to analyze EMA data for concurrent (same survey) and lagged (next survey) associations.\n\nSetting\n\nGeneral community.\n\nParticipants\n\nForty community-dwelling stroke survivors.\n\nInterventions\n\nNot applicable.\n\nMain Outcome Measure\n\nEMA measures of basic psychological needs (autonomy, competence, relatedness) and motivation (autonomous motivation, controlled motivation).\n\nResults\n\nIn concurrent analyses, increased autonomy (B=0.21, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.26, p<0.001), competence (B=0.10, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.19, p=0.021), and relatedness (B=0.10, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.13, p<0.001) were momentarily associated with higher autonomous motivation. Conversely, increased autonomy (B=-0.19, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.10, p<0.001) and competence (B=-0.09, 95% CI -0.17 to -0.01, p=0.020) were momentarily associated with lower controlled motivation. Contrary to SDT, increased relatedness was momentarily associated with higher controlled motivation (B=0.10, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.14, p<0.001). In lagged analyses, no momentary associations were detected between basic psychological needs and motivation (ps>0.05).\n\nConclusions\n\nFindings suggest that basic psychological need satisfaction is momentarily associated with motivation for daily activity participation. Additional research is warranted to examine the associations of different orientations of relatedness with autonomous and controlled motivation. Supporting basic psychological needs may foster stroke survivors’ autonomous motivation to enhance daily activity participation following stroke."

Future communication systems must include extensive capabilities as they will encompass a wide variety of devices and applications. Conventional physical layer decision mechanisms may not meet these requirements, as they are often based on impractical and oversimplifying assumptions that result in a trade-off between complexity and efficiency. By leveraging past experiences, learning-driven designs are promising solutions to present a resilient decision mechanism and enable rapid response even under exceptional circumstances. The corresponding design solutions should evolve following the lines of learning-driven paradigms that offer more autonomy and robustness. This evolution must take place by considering the facts of real-world systems and without restraining assumptions. In this paper, the common assumptions in the physical layer are presented to highlight their discrepancies with practical systems. As a solution, learning algorithms are examined by considering the implementation steps and challenges. Furthermore, these issues are discussed through a real-time case study using software-defined radio nodes to demonstrate the potential performance improvement. A cyber-physical framework is presented to incorporate future remedies."

The quantitative used a closed questionnaire applied to 17 institutions.Originality / Relevancy: A justification for the selection of TRDI based on the fact that the literature on exploration, exploitation, organizational structure, and innovation shows that the areas of PD of organizations, as well as high technology businesses, must be structured organically. Due to the need for decentralization, more fluid communications, greater autonomy, and the creation of knowledge are necessary as you flourish in turbulent and unstable environments.Main results: The results will reveal a predominance of the organic model in 19 two 21 institutes studied, using both stages. However, it seems that, despite strong guidance for the organic model, there are elements of the mechanistic model: the ability to combine bureaucracy will lose the necessary flexibility. This study reveals that when two models of organizational structures and exploration and exploitation are discussed, there is a gap between theory and application.Theoretical/methodological contributions: The study describes the analysis of the position of institutes in relation to obtaining, generating, and implementing expertise, examining how their organizational structures are configured to carry out related activities in a suitable way for exploration, exploration, and development of innovation in development. you root and increase.Social contributions / for management: In practical terms, this study is relevant because it allows managers and government institutions to establish and implement innovative policies and procedures in this type of technology center. These implications are related to decision-making processes, knowledge creation, guidance for exploration, exploration, ambidexterity, and types of innovation. Consequently, it can be presumed that the organizational structure of these orientations can be mixed. By these arguments, we understand that innovation, ambidexterity (exploration and exploitation), and organizational structure have a strong relationship."

It presents a new insight into implementing interactive methods to develop students’ communicative competence. In conditions of world integration, the formation of communicative and life skills is indispensable. Eventually, such an approach to English language learning in distance mode is the most accessible way for teacher-learner(s) interaction to acquire general linguistic expertise and upgrade specific language skills.\n The study results show that an interactive approach facilitates live communication in online EFL settings, enhances learners’ motivation and autonomy, and fosters quick decision-making reactions. Modern computer technologies offer boundless opportunities for interactive methods application in the online foreign language learning context. A skillful instructor is called to masterly plan computer-mediated classroom activities, creating space to realize each student’s cognitive and communicative potential fully. Students learn to debate, substantiate their viewpoints, brainstorm ideas, do projects, work individually or collaborate in comfortable learning settings."

The article is devoted to the description of the author’s methodology, which allows to identify the types of management and the degree of controllability of communication modes in different countries. The author relies on a systematic, cybernetic approach, on the theory of complex systems, uses the matrix method and the method of comparative analysis. Manageability is defined as a measure of control by the the management center (management entities that make decisions about rules and communication institutions), taking into account the voluntary consent of the objects of management with the level of their autonomy and subordination. The basis of the author’s methodology are three significant parameters: 1) location (inside or outside the country); 2) level of conventionality of the communication regime management centre; 3) assessment of the indicators of manageability. The main criteria of manageability are: the ability of communication mode control centres to transfer it from one state to another without conflict; the ability to achieve the controlled parameters of communication mode; the ability to use the mechanisms of self-organization and self-reflection of control objects to regulate communication modes."

It is also the current society to promote the comprehensive rule of law and to create and improve a modern rural social governance system under the leadership of the party committee, the government is responsible, the society is coordinated, and the country is governed by law. However, due to the wide distribution of rural areas and the large population base of farmers, there are many risks in the implementation of the rural revitalization strategy. In the comprehensive use of economic, administrative, and legal means, legal means has become the key. For this reason, this article conducted in-depth research on the legal path of rural revitalization under the risk prevention of Internet of Things algorithm decision-making. The research results showed that the risk prevention of Internet of Things algorithm decision-making was introduced into the research on the legal path of rural revitalization, and a sound rural governance system that combined autonomy, rule of law, and morality is an important part of the revitalization of seven villages. It can improve the 2.67% effectiveness of risk prevention in decision-making and can also play a key role in ruling the country according to law, showing the correct direction of agricultural legal system construction and at the same time high-level rural construction and development under the framework of the rule of law. It will vigorously promote the comprehensive modernization of agriculture, the comprehensive progress of rural areas, and the revitalization and development of rural areas."

Networked social movements mobilize their efforts to foster and balance public debate in their favor. In this article, we aim to understand how the communication strategies on #UERJResiste Facebook page in defense of the State University of Rio de Janeiro – UERJ – was presented in this public arena (Cefaï, 2017a, 2017b), in the period from January to April, 2017. 266 posts were collected to outline an ethnographic description (Laplantine, 2004) of the social movement. An interview was also held with one of the page’s administrators to understand how the content is produced in order to compose a situational analysis. As a result, we identified four categories that also constitute communication strategies: media politics, discourse of resisting, educational shares, and poetics of identity. In view of the privatization discourses of education and the attacks on its autonomy and its professionals, we understand #UERJResiste as a protagonist with an important narrative to be disseminated, reflected, and discussed in the defense of the Brazilian Public University. Among the main contributions to this study are networked social movements from an ethnographic perspective of a public arena. We also highlight an understanding of strategic communication in the civic dynamics, rebounding the importance of the autonomy of universities for democratic consolidation and citizen participation."

After all, it is well-established that young people’s disclosure practices support their efforts to maintain relationships, gain autonomy, and, by large, consolidate a place in the world. What is often missing, however, is an exploration of how the specific socio-cultural contexts of ethno-religious minority youths shape and are shaped by social media appropriations. Therefore, we conducted a 15-month ethnographic study among ethno-religious minority youths in which we investigated networked gift-giving practices. We stress the notion of “networked” because the results illustrate how these young people appropriate the amplified visibility of their relational maintenance behaviors on social media in order to negotiate status and social ties. We connect these findings to the concept of a “distrustful society” as the participants hold a general distrust in society due to experiences of racism and marginalization."

However, the effectiveness of the use of ESM is inconclusive. This study aims to explore the mechanism and boundary conditions of the relationship between employee ESM use and job performance. Design/methodology/approach This study uses a 2-wave survey design, with a final sample of 481 employees from a large automobile company. Findings The results indicate that ESM use is beneficial and detrimental to job performance. On the one hand, ESM use is positively related to work overload, decreasing job performance. On the other hand, ESM use is positively associated with informational support, increasing job performance. A mediation test revealed that both work overload and informational support mediate the relationship between ESM use and job performance. Furthermore, job autonomy weakens the positive relationship between ESM use and work overload, but strengthens the positive relationship between ESM use and informational support. Originality/value This study provides a more balanced view of how ESM use influences job performance by demonstrating the opposing mediating roles of work overload and informational support. Further, this study fills a research gap by considering job characteristics when examining the boundary conditions of ESM use. Third, this study validates the generalization of the job demands-resources model in social media research."

This requires an understanding of key factors that affect the involvement of robots in eldercare and the elderly willingness to embrace the robots’ domestic use. Trust is argued to be the main foundation of an effective adult-care provider, which might be more significant if such providers are robots. Establishing, and maintaining trust usually involves two main dimensions: 1) the robot’s reliability (i.e., performance) and 2) the robot’s intrinsic attributes, including its degree of anthropomorphism and benevolence. We conducted a pilot study using a mixed methods approach to explore the extent to which these dimensions and their interaction influenced elderly trust in a humanoid social robot. Using two independent variables, type of attitude (warm, cold) and type of conduct (error, no-error), we aimed to investigate if the older adult participants would trust a purposefully faulty robot when the robot exerted a warm behaviour enhanced with non-functional touch more than a robot that did not, and in what way the robot error affected trust. Lastly, we also investigated the relationship between trust and a proxy variable of actual use of robots (i.e., intention to use robots at home). Given the volatile and context-dependent nature of trust, our close-to real-world scenario of elder-robot interaction involved the administration of health supplements, in which the severity of robot error might have a greater implication on the perceived trust."

Our sample comprised 632 users of WeRun, the fitness plugin of WeChat, the largest Chinese mobile social networking app; participants completed an online survey and provided self-tracked physical activity data, which were subjected to latent class analysis. Based on the four-class latent class model (which yielded the best model fit and the most interpretable results), 30.5%, 27.5%, 24.7%, and 17.3% of the users were categorized as light users, reward-oriented users, lifestyle-oriented users, and interaction-oriented users, respectively. Moreover, class membership was associated with gender, age, education, income, life satisfaction, autonomy, and platform-based motivations. There is a significant heterogeneity in fitness app use and exercise behaviors. Platform-based motivations and autonomy are important classification factors, as users are looking for specific kinds of gratification from their use of fitness apps. Demographics and individual characteristics are also explanatory factors for class membership. The study findings suggest that fitness app designers should segment users based on motivation and gratification."

Rapid developments in information and communication technology (ICT) are fundamentally changing the ways in which work is conducted. At the same time, workforces are becoming increasingly older and age diverse. Integrating the model of workplace ICT use and work design with socioemotional selectivity theory from the lifespan development literature, we investigate employee age as a moderator of the indirect and total effects of ICT use for task and social functions on self-rated task proficiency and job satisfaction. As potential mediators, we focus on three job-related resources: job autonomy, team cohesion, and task significance. Data were collected from 1761 employees at three measurement points across two months. The results showed that ICT use for task and social functions were not significantly associated with job autonomy, team cohesion, task significance, task proficiency, and job satisfaction, while controlling for baseline levels of these mediator and outcome variables. Job autonomy was negatively related to task proficiency, and team cohesion was positively related, whereas both job autonomy and team cohesion were positively related to job satisfaction. Contrary to expectations, age did not moderate the indirect and total effects of ICT use for task and social functions on task proficiency and job satisfaction. We discuss the implications of our findings for future research and practice regarding ICT use and age in the work context."

Sportel \nIntroduction In daily life an alert or relaps prevention plan can be a helpful tool in preventing patients with severe mental illness (SMI) from relapse. However, patients often find it hard to keep the paper version close by. A smartphone version could be a solution. “MySolutions” is a webapplication providing the possibility to add e.g. pictures or music to the alert plan, which could be helping in time of need. Objectives To describe the lived experiences of patients with (SMI) with the webapplication ‘MySolutions’ and get insight in the helping and hindering characteristics of the application. Methods Qualitative research in a fenomenological framework. Eight interviews were held with outpatients with SMI. All interviews where methodically analyzed using the steps of Colaizzi (1978). Results In general, users were enthousiastic about the look and feel of the application. Using the application was considerd easy. Lived experiences of participants displayed the following themes: Autonomy, Acceptance, Frustration, Self confidence, and Reassurance. By practicing and adding photos and music, they perceived the webapplication to be a personal aid tool for experienced problems related to mental vulnerability in daily life. Participants also reported more difficulties in using the application in times of dysregulation. Conclusions The webapplication can be a valuable addition to the alert plan for people with SMI due to the possibility of personalization and the fact it is always available on a mobile phone. The application seems particularly suiting for people in a stabile phase. Future research should focus on phase of recovery in relation to use of the application. Disclosure No significant relationships."

Janicke-Bowles \n Luca Carbone \n Bojana Lobe \n Laura Vandenbosch \nResearch has extensively studied the negative effects of digital communication on adolescents’ well-being. However, positive digital experiences and behavior in adolescence are still poorly understood. The recently developed Digital Flourishing Scale addresses this gap and focuses on the positive perceptions of a user’s experiences and behaviors in digital communication among adults. In this paper, we developed an adolescent version of this scale. Study 1 demonstrated the internal consistency of the scale and the same factor structure for adolescence as for adulthood: connectedness, civil participation, positive social comparison, authentic self-presentation, and self-control. Study 2 confirmed the identified factor structure with a second sample of adolescents and established measurement invariance across genders. The construct validity of the scale was confirmed by investigating associations with related constructs, including the basic psychological needs from self-determination theory (competence, autonomy, and relatedness), secure attachment to a close friend, Internet aggression, social media-induced inspiration, authenticity of posted positive content, and social media self-control failure. The results indicated that not all adolescents flourish equally online. Differences occurred depending on the adolescents’ gender and socioeconomic status. The paper concludes that the newly developed scale is a valid and reliable measure for assessing adolescents’ perceptions of digital thriving and digital empowerment."

To form the creativity of students, it is necessary to use innovative technologies and the peculiarities of the digital environment. The author identifies the pedagogical conditions for the formation of students’ creativity. The theoretical and empirical methods used are the analysis of key concepts, observation, a survey and the analysis of students’ outcomes. The key concepts of creativity are clarified: “creativity” and the “ability to be creative”. The essential characteristics of creativity are revealed. The pedagogical conditions to form students’ creativity are revealed. They are: to include problem-solving tasks and pedagogical situations; to use reflection; to apply innovative pedagogical technologies. The creative technologies that contribute to the formation of students’ creativity are identified. The most effective technologies that contribute to the development of students’ creative abilities are information and communication technologies, project work, gamification, module learning, and group technologies. The common features of these technologies are cooperation, student’s autonomy and reflexive activity. The identified effective technologies and creative tasks offered can be used by the academic staff that implement Bachelor’s and Master’s education programs."

Reynolds \n Chongmei Huang \n Simin Tan \n Guoli Yang \n Jin Yan \nBackground Adolescence and emerging adulthood are critical periods for an individual’s sexual identity development. The internet has become a primary avenue for gay identity exploration. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of the internet in Chinese young gay male’s sexual identity development. Methods Qualitative interviews were conducted with 37 gay males aged 16 to 29. Data were analyzed using grounded theory methods. Results Three categories of identity development in relation to use of the internet were identified: (1) Gay identity confirming , which includes verifying same-sex attraction and connecting the attraction feeling to gay identity through consumption of pornography, Tanbi (boy’s love) materials, and searching for information online. (2) Gay identity practicing , includes interacting with the gay community to gain understandings of gay subcultures and make close gay friends, engaging in same-sex sexual and romantic relationship development through online group and interpersonal interactions. The internet practice impact on an individual’s cognition and behavior by presenting same-sex sexual contact is normal and common, facilitating longing for a romantic relationship, and facilitating relationship development; and (3) Gay identity coping , includes increasing self-acceptance of gay identity, gaining a sense of belonging in the gay community, increasing autonomy in sexual and romantic relationship development, and growing consideration of coming out to parents. Young gay males’ coping efficacy was gained through the lessons learned from identity practice. Conclusion The findings indicate that an individual’s internet practice facilitates gay identity confirmation, enriches identity practice, and promotes the transition from self-identification to identity disclosure and integration. Internet practice also threatens to young gay males’ sexual risk behavior, emotional hurts from failed romantic relationships. Interventions including sexual identity education and healthy internet use strategies need to be developed tailored to the developmental characteristics."

Our exploration is largely guided by the idea of reading as a social practice. In this paper, we specifically focus on the students’ reflections of their online experience of talking around academic texts. Method – The qualitative data used in this paper were derived from students’ reflective diaries, students’ FB interactions, and informal conversations and were collected from a group of students (27) attending a master’s class in distance learning mode.Thematic analysis was conducted to examine the themes that emerged to represent their reflections.Findings – The students’ reflections were grouped into two major categories: convenience and facilitation of learning.Students’ reflection on the convenience afforded by the FB talk centered mainly on the idea of distance and time. Their reflections on the facilitation of learning were broken down into the following themes: safe environment to explore, social support, self-regulation and autonomy.A separate category, “FB entries need responding”, was assigned to students’ comments about the importance of lecturer’s and group members’ feedback.Value – This study revealed the potential of FB as a convenient, safe and an informal avenue for students to share their understandings and reading-related problems.The informal nature of their FB experience supported free exploration of ideas without the worry of having to appear “clever”."

Chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) can be avoided by, amongst other things, making prudent lifestyle changes. However, stimulating long-term behaviour change remains an important challenge for health promotion practitioners. SelfDetermination Theory (SDT) has been applied in various health care settings to facilitate long-term behaviour change with some evidence of positive outcomes. From the perspective of SDT the effectiveness of prevention programmes should not only be defined as the proportion of participants that comply with recommendations, but should also give information on the level of autonomous motivation of the compliers. SDT would suggest that to stimulate the development of autonomous motivation and long-term behaviour change, autonomy-supporting interventions should be developed. Health care professionals can enhance patient behaviour change outcomes through support of patients’ psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. However, the health promotion field, involving health practitioners with various professional backgrounds, requires a more practical and specific summary of recommendations to improve the quality of intervention design. The aim of this manuscript is to describe in detail how practical recommendations from SDT were applied to a cardiovascular prevention programme in Belgium."

To help separate the wheat from the chaff, THE Journal asked five tech-savvy principals in five different states to reveal their favorite work-related apps. And just to be clear: Candy Crush doesn’t count, even if it does relieve stress after a tough day. Augmenting (and Staying Connected With) Reality Scott D. Godshalk, principal at 400-student Tohickon Valley Elementary School in Quakertown, PA, indulges his taste for the cutting edge with a free augmented reality app called Aurasma from HP Autonomy. Aurasma’s commercial applications include holding a smartphone over a movie trailer, for example, then watching that picture come to life through the phone with full video. This is all about taking a picture, and then creating an aura for that picture, and it’s pretty wild actually, said Godshalk. was trying to come up with a way to create a virtual tour of the building. have new students coming in frequently, and I thought it would be interesting, because we have a lot of iPads here at With the help of the Aurasma app, students and parents can take a guided tour of the school. At different points in the school, Godshalk said, ’They hold their device, point it at the certain picture, and that picture kind of comes to life on their screen, and there is a teacher describing, in a video–what happens in the physical education classes, for example. call it a trigger image. As your device recognizes that trigger image, it triggers the video that’s associated with it. As people walk through the school, they can learn more about individuals in our programs through this app. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] While it’s not nearly as exotic, Godshalk said the app he uses the most is Google Drive. Located at the top of his tablet and smartphone displays, the familiar app drives what I do all day long, he said. I say it’s a basic app, I mean it is a shared document. deal a lot with online forms and documents. Having everybody with access to these documents has increased our efficiency. In the realm of classroom management, Godshalk seeks to help his teachers with the high-tech equivalent of a gold star for students. The free app ClassDojo is essentially a behavior management tool. Teachers set up this app, and it’s a mechanism to give feedback to students, he explained. They bring this up on their computers through the website, but it’s also accessible through iPads and iPhones. When a teacher sees a student doing something that is appropriate, they touch that student’s icon on the iPad, which communicates with the website with an audible sound that is positive. Kids get that feedback up on the screen. started using this in the cafeteria, the bane of every principal’s existence, continued Godshalk, who is now in his 10th year as Tohickon Valley’s principal. We had each class in the cafeteria set up with their own little icon, and as they were demonstrating the appropriate behaviors, lunch aides were using iPads and giving points to classes, and they would see and hear the positive signal. Preparing for CCSS With Interactive Conversations Kara M. Butler, principal at 1,400-student Cupertino Middle School in Sunnyvale, CA, keeps her staff on the Common Core track with Common Core Look-fors (CCL4), which is $2.99 on iTunes. The app allows Butler to go into classrooms and make notes about activities connected to the standards. Butler, now in her ninth year as Cupertino’s principal, said, can even videotape and record things that are happening in the class for posterity, then provide feedback for teachers. All of that goes into a file for me to accumulate information as to what I’m seeing in my classrooms. …"

Jensen \nThis paper investigates the relationship between campaign communications and the discursive frames articulated more generally by social media users in the context of the 2012 U.S. presidential election. It identifies campaign frames with respect to the clusters of terms produced by the campaigns themselves and identifies the extent to which these same clusters prevail over time throughout the campaign in the tweets produced by Twitter users more generally. The findings suggest that some frames fail to resonate at all while others prevail primarily with the intensification of campaign communications. These results indicate that tweets produced by the general public are neither wholly steered by elites nor wholly autonomous. Rather they appear dialogical."

    "text": "Doc 1741 :  Engaging Young Adolescents in School-Based Writing \nhttps://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1144798\n Deborah S. Yost \n Ling L. Liang \n Robert Vogel \nINTRODUCTIONHow might middle school teachers and schools more appropriately engage early adolescent students in the writing process so that they are motivated and engaged to want to write and write well? We know that education for young adolescents must be developmentally responsive, challenging, empowering, and equitable. There is also a need for strong, authentic relationships among and between the student, curriculum, community, teacher, and school. As well, the curriculum must engage students in active, purposeful learning. These essential attributes connect to the literature on student engagement and highlight a unique approach to writing that has been implemented in Philadelphia area schools over the past 10 years.The purpose of this article is to introduce Writers Matter, an approach designed to engage and motivate young adolescents in the writing process, connect this approach to the student engagement literature and provide research results from a pre-post writing survey that focuses on student engagement. Writers Matter supports literacy, equity, and excellence in middle grades through its focus on autonomy, voice, and relationship building in the context of writing tasks that connect to personal experience and other content areas (Yost «fe Vogel, 2012).RELATED RESEARCH ON STUDENT ENG A GEMENTAdolescents write all the time, through text messages, Twitter, and blogs. Why is it that so many adolescents are less motivated to complete writing tasks required in school? The literature on student engagement may provide the reader with some answers, since it is well known that engaged students are more successful in school (Fredricks, Blumenfeld, «fe Paris, 2004; Martin «fe Dowson, 2009; Osterman, 2000; Wang The school engagement literature seeks to discover ways to create environments that stimulate greater learning. According to Fredricks et al. (2004), many adolescents view school as boring or a grade game, in which students try to get by with as little effort as pos* sible (p. 60). Further, these authors state that recent studies have shown steep declines in school motivation among adolescents. The literature defines engagement in three ways (Fredricks et al., 2004):* Behavioral engagement includes involvement in academic or social/extracurricular activities.* Cognitive engagement centers on students’ motivation or drive to persist on academic tasks, thus developing and using self-regulation strategies in order to succeed.* Emotional engagement focuses on adolescents’ positive or negative reactions to teachers, classmates, academics, and the school.All contribute in different ways to increased academic learning and achievement.Cognitive EngagementCognitive engagement comprises a willingness on the part of students to expend the necessary effort to master difficult skills using strategies that support learning. Studies have found that students are strategic about their learning in settings that are socially supportive, respectful, challenging and autonomous (Fredricks et al., 2004). Cognitive engagement occurs when class members actively debate and discuss ideas, and engage in a critique of others’ work in an environment that is mutually respectful. A key concept in this research is that cognitive engagement occurs more readily in supportive, caring learning environments.Peterson and Hittie (2003) identify several attributes of a supportive learning community:* belonging (feeling a valued member of a group);* inclusion (membership in the group is open and diversity is valued);* support and care (group members receive support, mentoring, assistance, and caring they need in order to develop coping strategies; all members of the group help each other to achieve, which is a community goal);* contributions and responsibility (all members have an obligation to contribute to the common good); and* democratic problem solving (conflicts are managed by inclusive dialogue and democratic decision making; listening, understanding, and perspective taking are crucial prerequisites). …"

Partha Chat- terjee expanded on this latter point by asking Chakravarty what, in his view, would constitute change. Was not the worker-trade union leader relationship an essentially new one? The trade union leader had, in fact, a bourgeois understanding of his role as a political representative of the people. Dipesh Chakravarty replied that although there were obvious empirical differences between rural zamindar-dominated society and urban industrial society, relationships of power and authority continued to be similar. He accepted that his analysis was pessimistic, but in India there were few grounds for optimism. It was one thing to believe in the possibility of a change for the better, another to argue that it was coming in the near future. He accepted the possibility of change, but: not the immediate likelihood, and this essay was an attempt to understand why this was so. He felt that Marxists who analysed all problems in terms of structure and superstructure tended to be blind to the critical problem of culture, and he argued that there is a great need for a theory of culture in Marxist writing. In conclusion, we may say that the papers presented at this conference showed a greater awareness of the need to analyse the relationship of collaboration between subaltern and elite classes as well as that of conflict. Other elements which came out in the whole discussion were the need to combat narrow economistic explanations for subaltern actions, the need to focus strongly on political relationships, the relative autonomy which exists between the thought and actions of elite and subaltern classes, and the need to understand better the nature of the tenacious hold of culture within the Indian social formation. The study of subaltern consciousness and culture, it was brought out, was central to the whole project. In this, the authors of these papers accepted the need to approach popular beliefs and understandings through a more sophisticated analysis of texts. This is, perhaps, one of the directions in which we may expect the subaltern studies project to move in the future."

    "text": "Doc 1744 :  On Being Transhuman: Commercial BCIs and the Quest for Autonomy \nhttps://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3840840\n Argyro Karanasiou \nFacebook’s catchphrase “What’s on your mind”, prompting the user to share thoughts with their digital social circles, has gained a new, literal meaning in recent years: targeted advertising, fake news and computational propaganda all being examples of mental ma-nipulation exerted for profit or for power through harnessing AI at scale for the purposes of online profiling. In most cases, this in-volves an elaborate interpretation of one’s digital footprint: the huge amount of data that is generated by our daily online and offline in-teractions and which defines our behaviour. This chapter takes a slightly different approach and seeks to explore the use of AI to re-trieve, analyse and predict data that has not been externalised, yet which most defines us: brain data. There has never been a more promising time in history for delineating the contours of human thought: Public and privately funded projects studying the human brain have produced a high vol-ume of scientific papers and findings in the last few decades, which more often than not are sensationalised in the news. The ambitious plan to explain the mysteries of the human brain has not fully materialised, however ambition drives profit, and therefore the idea of using AI to decode the human brain has been a fast growing commercial venture for many tech giants, who have been investing heavily in corporate R & D neurotech related projects. The chapter proceeds in four parts: Part 1 offers a historical overview of “mind reading” techniques, building up some context as to how the neurotech market boomed and started employing AI to unravel the mysteries of the human brain beyond the clinical sphere. This is then followed by a techno-legal evaluation of the monitoring, collection and analysis of brain imaging data from the use of com-mercial BCIs in Part 2. Building further on this, Part 3 explores the scope for user empowerment and agency in commercial BCI. This will lead to the main argument put forth in Part 4, namely the fact that commercial BCI constitutes a special case that seems to fall through the cracks of robust data protection frameworks, such as the GDPR. In conclusion, the chapter highlights the need for data protection laws to reflect the conceptual redefinition of autonomy in the light of AI- driven pervasive neurotechnologies."

In that sense, the use of ICT for educational purposes has been positioned as a dynamic and interactive alternative that allows the application of knowledge and encourages the feedback in the learning process. This paper aims to reflect on the use of ICT in accounting education as a strategy to improve teaching and learning processes in students of the Department of Finance of Metropolitan Institute of Technology of Medellin. It is proposed a teaching method with a learning virtual object through a virtual mediator of accounting formulations. It has a pedagogical purpose of providing students with a conceptual and practical tool to interpret and analyze accounting and financial topics at the enterprise level. It is observed that the interaction between accounting graph logic and logic of dynamic perception facilitates the processes of teaching and learning in the disciplines of accounting and finance. It is reflected in greater motivation and understanding of mathematical equations in financial area that will carry out to experimentation of knowledge learned in the classroom."

However, as institutional theory suggests, it is likely that the adoption of management consultancy in China is driven more by mimetic isomorphism factors than by actual performance considerations. Using data from a survey of 219 listed Chinese firms, our results suggest that there are significant positive effects from mimetic isomorphism factors and adoption of management accounting and controls and information and communication technology. Our study provides strong evidence that the adoption of management consultancy has a positive effect on firm performance, yet we cannot conclude that management consultancy is adopted to improve firm performance. Moreover, state ownership held by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) has a significant and positive effect on management consultancy adoption, whereas state ownership held by government agencies does not. One interpretation is that firms controlled by SOEs have acquired increased autonomy and become more innovative."

These issues have motivated researchers to make a paradigm shift in the OSN architecture by proposing to replace centrally controlled OSNs with Decentralized OSNs (DOSNs) in a peer-to-peer setting. DOSNs give users more autonomy and the chance to participate in social networks without loosing control over their data. The various DOSN proposals have significant differences in their proposed services, architecture and extent of decentralization. In this survey, we study a number of proposals for peer-to-peer DOSNs, distil a set of criteria to compare them, and provide a taxonomy for their comparison."

A projective method was applied to tap into tourists’ opinions and feelings about their smartphones as intelligent agents, and how these influence their attitudes toward push recommendations they receive while experiencing tourist destinations. While smartphones have a mediating role in the tourism experience, a paradox exists in which tourists recognize an enhancement in certain aspects of a travel experience and a reduction in others. Confidence toward proactive recommendations is largely rooted in perceived proactiveness, autonomy, social ability and intelligence of smartphones, while perceived reactivity and control lead tourists to fear that they will lose control over their tourism experiences. Several managerial implications are provided."

In this the focus is on interaction within families. If a shift is made to the more modern perspective of second-order cybernetics, the emphasis changes to fall on the autonomy of various levels of system. In this paper, psychosomatic symptoms are described and illustrated as the expression of ideas aimed at the conservation of autonomy, both at an individual and a family level. The implications of such a changed perspective for the treatment of psychosomatic disorders are highlighted."

Gilson \n Carlton Cooke \nPURPOSE: We explored these issues qualitatively among sedentary university employees recruited to a 10-week randomised controlled trail. The trial compared walking routes, walking within daily tasks and controls on daily step totals, showing that, compared to controls, interventions resulted in @1000 extra steps per day. METHOD: Fifteen participants representing both trial arms contributed semi-structured interviews at post-intervention assessments, supported by six recorded peer debriefings. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and subject to inductive coding. RESULTS: Increased walking at work resulted in an overall effect of ‘Improved sense of self within the organisation’. Attention provided by pedometers, physiological monitoring and weekly e-mail motivational messages were all considered important contributors in producing this effect and were seen as an institutional investment in staff. Increased walking helped to feel healthier (‘When steps were higher, it was obvious I felt better’), generated autonomy and provided variety within normal work days. Walking within daily tasks helped to establish much-valued face-to-face contact with colleagues (‘Talking to colleagues in person was more effective than emails it was more sociable’). This also simplified completion of daily tasks, while walking together on routes helped colleagues to resolve inter-personal tensions. However, reducing time spent at desks caused concern for some supervisors who questioned employee productivity; this challenge was rarely offered to more senior employees. CONCLUSION: Extra walking at work, however it was achieved, produced a powerful effect on employee morale which was linked to improved emotional control and mental focus, better mood and increased energy. These collective effects are central to improved morale and subjective estimates of more effective work performance based on increased walking during the working day."

By means of a discussion group and an online questionnaire, our critical case examined a group of mature senior students from the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (online learning) who have used computers and the Internet in their activities. In general, the participants needed to know the function of the tool beforehand and to have continued support and confidence. In particular, they need the certainty that the future technology will allow them to maintain their independence and autonomy. Older people’s adoption of IT needs to be treated as more than merely a question of usability. Attitudes, experience of use, and perceived benefits are also key aspects that must be taken into account."

These opinions constitute a valuable resource for businesses, governments and consumers. In the last years, some researchers have proposed opinion extraction systems, mostly domain-independent ones, to automatically extract structured representations of opinions contained in those texts. In this work, we tackle this task in a domain-oriented approach, defining a set of domain-specific resources which capture valuable knowledge about how people express opinions on a given domain. These resources are automatically induced from a set of annotated documents. Some experiments were carried out on three different domains (user-generated reviews of headphones, hotels and cars), comparing our approach to other state-of-the-art, domain-independent techniques. The results confirm the importance of the domain in order to build accurate opinion extraction systems. Some experiments on the influence of the dataset size and an example of aggregation and visualization of the extracted opinions are also shown."

For more than 30 years, debates about the bi-polarity of formative and summative assessment have served as surrogates for discussions about the workings of the mind, the social implications of assessment and, as important, the role of instruction in the advancement of learning. Currently, alternative assessment lives uneasily with its classical counterpart. Classical test theory–and its conception of the summative value of the true score–came from behaviourist learning theories developed in the first three decades of the twentieth century. Formative assessment, with its conceptions of feedback and development, had a different origin. It arose from cognitive and constructivist theories of learning that emerged in the 1930s and 1940s. This paper identifies the tensions that underpin this uneasy coexistence. It suggests that different conceptions of mind lie behind these tensions and, to mark the autonomy and integrity of formative asse…"

There are many studies on flow, is intrinsic motivation, influencing satisfaction and Loyalty, but there are little studies which variables influences flow. this study is explore causality of autonomy, competence, relatedness which are major variables of self-determination theory that studied factors effecting intrinsic motivation influencing flow and satisfaction. This study developed a research model to explain the use of smartphone, and collected 670 survey responses from the office workers of seoul S company who had experiences with such smartphone. To prove the validity of the proposed research model, SEM analysis is applied with valid 670 questionnaires. The results, firstly, autonomy positively influences flow. secondly, competence significantly influences flow. thirdly, relatedness significantly influenced flow. also, upper above results shows that flow influences satisfaction."

Ho has been researching sexuality and supporting freedom for marginalised sexual minorities for ten years. In a public statement in response to the charges, she said that the work of scholarly research must not be dictated by prejudice and that differences in sexual values should not be arbitrated by law and should be open for public discussion. As the legal process began in January 2004, Ho’s supporters in Taiwan have called for the preservation of the Taiwan Constitutional decree on integrity and autonomy of academic research and freedom of expression on the internet, for the University to resist calls to dismiss Ho from her post, and for respect for freedom of speech and expression and the right to create spaces to educate people about non-normative sexualities."

Examining online social behaviors from a cross-cultural perspective \nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s00146-007-0143-0\n Hiroaki Morio \n Christopher Buchholz \nCommunication on the Internet is often described as “anonymous”, yet the usage of the term is often confusing, even in academia. Three levels of anonymity, visual anonymity, dissociation of real and online identities, and lack of identifiability, are thought to have different effects on various components of interpersonal motivation. Specifically, we propose that cross-cultural differences in interpersonal motivation (autonomy vs. affiliation) are illustrated by choices individuals make when deciding whether or not to remain anonymous while communicating online. Autonomy is often valued in Western societies, whereas Eastern societies tend to emphasize affiliation, suggesting that individuals in Western societies will gravitate toward online communities that allow lower levels of anonymity, while individuals in Eastern societies will be more likely to seek out online communities that promote higher levels of anonymity. The research presented in this article supports this notion, suggesting that we need to consider cultural differences when designing online communication systems and other communications technologies."

Torres \nExponential growing of scientific and technological knowledge of nowadays society demands new abilities and competences of theirs citizens. In the other hand, the development of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and the low cost of equipments provide a new teaching strategy, namely distance education, through intranet or internet. The familiarity with of scientific method stimulates autonomy in obtaining information, critical thinking and logical analysis of data. These are useful abilities for science students as well as for common citizens. Aiming the development of such abilities a distance course was developed in 45 hours, using mainly forum and chat in the Claroline platform with technical support of the Centro Nacional de Supercomputacao da UFRGS. All the students attending the course were from Fundacao Faculdade Federal de Ciencias Medicas de Porto Alegre. In this course the following topics were explored: (1) scientific knowledge x common sense, (2) different conceptions of science, (3) scientific method, (4) different categories of science publications, (5) principles of Logic, (6) deduction x induction (7) paper analysis simulation. Scientific project writing was taught/learned through the following items: (1) choice of a problem, (2) bibliography revision, (3) agencies for funding, (4) project presentation by videoconference and (5) analysis of results. The course was evaluated by Likert-type questionnaire and the results from students and teachers indicate a very successful outcome."

L. Yuen \n Wang On Li \nThe Internet provides an easily accessible way to meet certain needs. Over-reliance on it leads to problematic use, which studies show can be predicted by psychological distress. Self-determination theory proposes that we all have the basic need for autonomy, competency, and relatedness. This has been shown to explain the motivations behind problematic Internet use. This study hypothesizes that individuals who are psychologically disturbed because their basic needs are not being met are more vulnerable to becoming reliant on the Internet when they seek such needs satisfaction from online activities, and tests a model in which basic needs predict problematic Internet use, fully mediated by psychological distress. Problematic Internet use, psychological distress, and basic needs satisfaction were psychometrically measured in a sample of 229 Hong Kong University students and structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesized model. All indices showed the model has a good fit. Further, statistical testing supported a mediation effect for psychological distress between needs satisfaction and problematic Internet use. The results extend our understanding of the development and prevention of problematic Internet use based on the framework of self-determination theory. Psychological distress could be used as an early predictor, while preventing and treating problematic Internet use should emphasize the fulfillment of unmet needs."

The Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) business standard is an illustration of such an early adoption of the advances in computer networking. The ubiquity and the affordability of the Web has made it possible for the masses of businesses to automate their B2B interactions. However, several issues related to scale, content exchange, autonomy, heterogeneity, and other issues still need to be addressed. In this paper, we survey the main techniques, systems, products, and standards for B2B interactions. We propose a set of criteria for assessing the different B2B interaction techniques, standards, and products."

In particular, this study focuses on how students view the role of asynchronous computer-mediated communication in the development of language pedagogy through an exchange with expert teachers from secondary schools. The author gathered data from 32 students who participated in weekly discussion boards, wrote monthly reflective logs, filled out surveys, and joined group interviews. The findings demonstrated that online discussions promoted scaffolding by which expert teachers assisted students in creating reflective messages. In addition, threaded discussions fostered learners’ autonomy and accountability while supporting collaborative learning through social interaction. The study suggests three essential ingredients to maximize the potential benefits of discussion board for language teacher training: (1) use of carefully designed tasks that engage critical thinking, (2) scaffolding strategies for monitoring group discussions, and (3) inclusion of online etiquette to avoid confusion and reduce personal conflicts."

School-age learners of French and English in four countries (Belgium, England, France and Senegal) were placed in groups of about six, and encouraged to communicate both freely with each other and in response to certain stimuli. An analysis of the discourse via the online messages written by participants finds a high level of response, with learners exercising autonomy in a variety of ways. Learners use both their native tongue (L1) and the foreign language (L2) to communicate, without teacher intervention, with peers in other cultural contexts, and there is evidence to suggest that participation in E-group learning of this kind could de…"

The degree to which parents accept childrens opinions or attitudes when they engage in dialogue may be connected with consumer socialization and affect the criteria for the evaluation of character fashion products. This study examined the effects of mothers childrearing attitudes on consumer socialization and the evaluation criteria for character fashion products for children. A questionnaire was conducted via the Internet on 310 mothers with children aged between four and twelve. The results of the study showed: First, childrearing attitudes were divided into four dimensions: hostility, autonomy, acceptance, and control. Consumer socialization was divided into communication in regards to consumption, consumption control, and the awareness of social relations. The evaluation criteria for character fashion products for children were divided into educational/utilitarian values, emotional values, and social values. Second, mothers were divided into an acceptance group, a moderation group, and a hostility group based on childrearing attitudes. The group with hostile childrearing attitudes had control over their children`s consumption and were conscious of others in the process of consumption. The group with accepting childrearing attitudes considered educational/utilitarian values and emotional values when they purchased character fashion products for children. The group with hostile childrearing attitudes considered social values. Third, autonomous childrearing attitudes had the largest influence on communication in regards to consumption. Controlling childrearing attitudes had the largest influence on consumption control and the awareness of social relations. Controlling childrearing attitudes had the largest influence on social/utilitarian and emotional values; however hostile childrearing attitudes had the largest influence on social values."

CHAT views learning as a shared, social process rather than as an individual event. Participants’ experiencing and learning was mediated by the physical and social conditions of the experience and by the contributions of other participants. The concept of mediation suggests that the meaning participants make of experience is not an individual event, but instead is enacted as a creative, collaborative process using cultural and institutional tools. The recognition that people’s physical, social and reflective learning processes are mediated, challenges longstanding assumptions about the radical autonomy of learners, about ‘direct experience,’ and about the centrality of independent, cognitive reflection in experiential learning. Empirical data showing processes of mediation are presented, and the implications for research and theory are discussed."

The modules are part of a course delivered both in presence and at a distance with a dual focus: learning a content - Linguistics - through a foreign language - Italian - in an integrated dimension. The online course, inspired by constructivist and learner-centred approaches, presents a series of collaborative and communicative technology-based activities developed in a virtual classroom and structured around three main sections: thematic, social and linguistic. The first presents the contents of the course (Morphology) through a video lesson with a series of interactive multimedia activities, the second promotes interaction between teachers and students through forums and chats, the third offers a virtual self-access centre with pathways and resources that students can choose, according to their levels and needs, to learn the Italian language."

This article focuses on supervisors’ written online communication about drafts of undergraduate student dissertations. Theoretically, these utterances form part of the communicative exchanges performed in the practice of supervision. This means that supervision is an emergent phenomenon that relates to its past, current, and future states. The setting was a dissertation course within a bachelor programme in behavioural science. The data consists of 423 utterances from four supervisors. The utterances were analysed and categorised, and the results show different qualities and degrees of identifications in the supervisors’ communicated utterances. The study shows that the quality of supervisors’ utterances embraces the difference between the application of comments, points of view, instructions, and questions. This implicates the importance of supervisors’ awareness of the nature and the combination of their utterances if they want to increase the student autonomy when supervising online."

This obstruction has been described as the organisation-practice (OP) barrier. Objective To develop an inter-organisational sports safety promotion model targeted at prevention of overuse injuries by identifying initiatives that lastingly will bridge the OP barrier. Design Participatory action research with focus group interviews using the quality function deployment (QFD) technique. Setting Swedish athletics involving the Swedish Athletics Association (SAA), clubs, athletes, coaches, and other stakeholders in the sport. Participants Representatives of Swedish athletics; officials from different divisions of the SAA, coaches, athletes, medical personal, club representatives and parents to youth athletes (year 1: n=12; year 2: n=35). Qualitative data collected and analyzed Sports needs (Voice of Sports), organizational requirements, organizational changes. Main qualitative outcomes Organizational facilitators of sports safety promotion targeted at prevention of overuse injuries. Results An organic sports safety model resulted from the transformation of identified sports needs and organizational requirements into organisational changes. In this model, a dynamic and constantly active organisation-practice membrane reaches across the OP barrier. This organizational membrane consists of an infrastructure supporting continuous exchange of data and information between different actors in athletics. The central component is an Internet-based safety surveillance system covering Swedish athletics as a whole. A ‘Safety Forum’ is used for safety discussions between athletes, researchers, and SAA representatives, and a ‘Coaches’ Corner9 allows communication between experienced coaches and younger colleagues. Conclusions An inter-organizational sports safety model facilitating collaboration between sports organisations and sportspersons was developed in the setting of Swedish athletics. The principal feature in the model is an infrastructure supporting continuous exchange of data and information between different actors. Further research is warranted to prospectively evaluate the effectiveness of the novel model in overuse injury prevention."

Dutta-Bergman \nThe recent growth in consumer autonomy in health care accompanied by the surge in the use of new media for health information gathering has led to an increasing scholarly interest in understanding the consumer health information search construct. This article explores consumer health information seeking in the realm of the primary sources of health information used by consumers. Based on an analysis of the 1999 HealthStyles data, the paper demonstrates that active communication channels such as interpersonal communication, print readership, and Internet communication serve as primary health information sources for health-conscious, health-information oriented individuals with strong health beliefs, and commitment to healthy activities. On the other hand, passive consumption channels such as television and radio serve as primary health information resources for individuals who are not health-oriented. Media planning implications are drawn from the results, suggesting that broadcast outlets with an entertainment orientation are better suited for prevention campaigns. Such channels provide suitable sites for entertainment-education. On the other hand, print media, interpersonal networks, and the Internet are better suited for communicating about health issues to the health-active consumer segment."

From this perspective, developing fully autonomous military robots should be doubly desirable: the technical process of ‘teaching’ robots ethics would finally systematize just war thinking, while robots could uphold the rules of engagement even under the most emotionally trying of situations. This article addresses my doubts about both claims. I argue that truly ethical behavior requires what classical just war theorists would have called soul, or what we might today term conscience – and that the flexibility of the traditional principles reflects this understanding. In pursuit of this argument, this article proceeds in two parts. First, it argues that the apparent ‘messiness’ of just war thought is actually morally useful. Second, it argues that emotions play an important and irreplaceable role in our ethical behavior, particularly as…"

This paper utilises the Chatham redevelopment project as a basis from which to discuss recent developments in UK policy. It draws upon the methods of critical discourse analysis in order to discuss particular tensions within the project in the context of central-local government relations, partnership arrangements, project implementation and marketing. The paper’s conclusion is that, in spite of the initiatives established to devolve decision-making and establish regional autonomy, property-led development projects in the UK are likely to remain tightly controlled with only limited scope for community groups to exert influence."

It is necessary, however, to identify first the factors critical for acquiring ethical competence and later to proceed to the construction and use of such tools, in order to ensure that these tools are indeed adapted to the process and the goals of business ethics education. Based on psychological theory and research, it is argued that one such crucial factor is the psychological construct of ethical autonomy. The strengths and weaknesses of information and communication technology tools are discussed in accordance with this, and some suggestions are given on fruitful ways to incorporate these tools in business ethics education."

The aim of the current study was to explore and describe the strategies young women with Type 1 diabetes used to manage transitions in their lives. This paper will describe one aspect of the findings of how women with Type 1 diabetes used the Internet to interact with other people with diabetes and create stability in their lives. Background. Individuals living with diabetes develop a range of different strategies to create stability in their lives and enhance their well-being. Changing social and emotional conditions during life transitions have a major impact on diabetes management. Although the literature indicates that strategies enabling the individuals to cope with transitions are important, they remain under-researched. Design. Using grounded theory, interviews were conducted with 20 women with Type 1 diabetes. Constant comparative data analysis was used to analyse the data and develop an understanding of how young women with Type 1 diabetes used the Internet to create stability in their lives. Findings. The findings revealed that the women valued their autonomy and being in control of when and to whom they reveal their diabetic status, especially during life transitions and at times of uncertainty. However, during these times they also required health and social information and interacting with other people. One of the women’s main strategies in managing transitions was to use Internet chat lines as a way of obtaining information and communicating with others. This strategy gave women a sense of autonomy, enabled them to maintain their anonymity and interact with other people on their own terms. Conclusions. Having meaningful personal interactions, social support and being able to connect with others were fundamental to the women’s well being. Most importantly, preserving autonomy and anonymity during such interactions were integral to the way the women with Type 1 diabetes managed life transitions. Relevance to clinical practice. Health professionals need to explore and incorporate Internet communication process or anonymous help lines into their practice as a way to assist people manage their diabetes."

Cyberbullying is a growing phenomenon in our society with the technological advances that are occurring. This type of bullying can transpire at all hours via text message, email, or social networking sites. According to several studies, college students are being affected by cyberbullying, with prevalence rates ranging from 8% to 21%. Many psychological ramifications exist as a result of cyberbullying among victims and bullies. It is crucial to learn more about how this phenomenon is affecting the social and learning environments in college, as well as how college students view cyberbullying. First and second-year students at a southern university were recruited to participate in this qualitative study. The researchers conducted six focus groups with 54 students. The participants reported reasons for cyberbullying in the college environment, such as retaliation in relationships. Independence and autonomy were discussed as reasons why college students do not report cyberbullying to others when it occurs. Participants discussed future interventions to reduce cyberbullying that included coping strategies, utilizing university services, and engaging in legal action. The authors recommend utilizing a multi-level Socio-Ecological approach to reduce cyberbullying rates. Additionally, evaluation research needs to be conducted on what works and what does not in the prevention of cyberbullying."

To achieve this it examines two issues that have been tentatively linked to the relative decline of the power and autonomy of biomedicine - complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and the Internet-informed patient. Drawing on these two different but interconnected social phenomena, this paper reflects on the potential limitations of power-based theorisations of the medical profession and its relationship to patients and other non-biomedically situated professional groups. It is argued that power-based conceptual schemas may not adequately reflect the non-linear and complex strategic adaptations that are occurring among professional groups."

    "text": "Doc 236 :  Introduction to the special issue on agent autonomy in groups \nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/0954009021000068772\n Henry Hexmoor \nThis special issue of the Connection Science journal features ten papers on agent autonomy. The introduction describes the motivation for the special issue and briefly overviews the contributions. The papers in this volume are revised and extended version of selected papers from a workshop that was held in July 2002, in Edmonton, Canada, in conjunction with AAAI 2002 conference. This workshop followed an IJCAI 2001 workshop with the same title. Autonomy is a characterizing notion of agents but a one-size fit all definition does not exist. The desire to build agents that exhibit a satisfactory quality of autonomy has included agents that have a long life, are highly independent, can harmonize their goals and actions with humans and other agents, and are generally socially adept. In 2002, our workshop focus was not only to continue to understand salient social notions in agent interaction that involve autonomy but scaling issues of social networks on inter-group interactions. We explored theories that synthesized the inter-agent interaction into unified models as well as derived and implied attitudes that are beyond the immediate and direct inter-agent attitudes, which play a big role in balance of attitudes among agents in a group. As in 2001, we had researchers in multiagency as well as human-agent and human-robot interactions. In agent-agent interaction, the agents are designed to change their interaction in order to optimize local qualities such as cost or system qualities such as coherence. In organized groups, agents are designed to model the organizational structure and the concerns are mostly with deontic concepts. It is clearly important for agents to understand human preferences and guidance in complex systems. This involves many issues from abilities to comprehend issues related to delegation in natural language to understanding human emotions. Presentations covered several space systems and a large naval application. Discussions of applied research motivated the need for agents to explicitly reason about autonomy and delegation. Although there is a need for increased autonomy on the part of agents, there are times when autonomy is harmful. For instance, when agents are fully autonomous and their actions are un-interruptible. Humans in the loop of such agents may come to harm if they cannot interrupt actions of agents. Also, if agents have negative influence on one another, their independence may detract from harmonious interaction. When tasks among agents are coupled, cooperating agents need to take one another’s actions into account and not be self-interested. This workshop has contributed to understanding of social agent interactions. Jean-Claude Martin (2002, this issue) introduces TYCOON as a framework for the analysis of human verbal and non verbal behaviour. This system is used in making sense of multimodal human-computer interaction and human-human communication. This work is similar to digital Ethnography that allows study of intensely interactive collaboration at the level of both language and physical coordination in time and space (Hutchins, 1995). This is an ongoing project and agents could be endowed with more autonomy by spontaneously volunteering information to participants. Jean-Michel Hoc (2000, this issue) presents issues of dynamic allocation of activities in cooperation between human operators and autonomous machines in complex environments. He suggests that a different consideration of decomposition of the overall task into subtasks is needed for humans and automated agents. He gives examples from a series of studies on human-machine cooperation in air traffic control in order to illustrate his argument. Among his main points are (a) tasks be defined with intentions, (b) mutual monitoring of humans and agents is needed, and (c) knowledge and plans should be shared among humans and agents. Connection Science 2003 2 McCauley and Franklin (2002, this issue) approach present a real world massive MAS with approximately 350,000 individual agents that addresses a problem in the US Navy for assigning jobs to sailors at the end of each sailor’s tour of duty. They have developed a cognitive agent capable of reasoning about autonomy of sailors and navy human detailers. They go on to discuss major issues regarding the design, interaction, and autonomy of the various agents involved. Castelfranchi and Falcone (2002 this issue) suggest relationships between trust and control in agents. They claim that the basic form of dyadic trust between two agents is the opposite of the notion of dyadic control between those agents. However, the more general notion of trust relies on control between agents. Several other nuances of interaction between control and trust are explained. Barber and MacMahon (2002, this issue) consider group formation that specifies and optimizes the allocation of decisionmaking and action-execution responsibilities for a set of goals among agents within the MAS. They present an analysis of space of decision-making and adaptations in decision-making. This work helps us reason about improvements in organizational capabilities for decision-making and suggests changes in the structure of the organization. Schillo (2002, this issue) explores the relationship between self-organization of multiagent systems and adjustable autonomy in intelligent agents. His analysis pivots on the notion of delegation in order to define organizational relationships. He distinguishes task delegation from social delegation. He draws several organizational models where with increased structure autonomy is diminished. Schreckenghost, Martin, Bonasso, Kortenkamp, Milam, and Thronesbery (2002, this issue) present another real world MAS from a NASA mission. This system supports collaboration among these heterogeneous agents while they operate remotely and communicate asynchronously with multiple humans in the control loop. They identify research issues in groups where members have non-overlapping roles and guided by high level plans. We have made a radical observation that in the space-based operations dynamically reconfiguration of team is not common. This author (Hexmoor 2002, this volume) presents a model that relates autonomy and power. He then goes on to discuss group effects that amplify the individual notions of power and autonomy. An algorithm for task allocation was discussed that showed a use of grouping agents into power groups. This work is step in the direction of defining autonomy and power that applies to a group, i.e., collective autonomy and collective power. Kar, Dutta and Sen (2002, this issue) illustrate effectiveness of probabilistic reciprocity for promoting cooperation among agents. This is an extension of their work on reciprocity between individual agents. In this extension, group members offer opinions about the balance of their past interactions with individuals in other groups. The group must decide based on collective opinions of its members. Group interactions are diminished when agents lie about their balance. However, in certain pattern of group selection lying is ineffective. O’Hare (2002, this issue) explores virtual agent communities and identifies issues that underpin social cohesion. Among other points, he points out the importance of awareness and presence in collaboration. Several domains are examined in robotics, mobile/wearable platforms, and tour guide avatars."

The success of the Zapatistas in mobilising Mexican and international ‘civil society’, particularly through the Internet, in a common struggle against the disastrous human and environmental consequences of neoliberalism, globalisation and “free trade” and for increased autonomy for indigenous peoples has forced the PRI regime, under the instigation of the US government and World Bank, to adopt a more violent and politically riskier strategy of repression through state terror.

However, this paper argues that the official discursive construction of the NGfL in this way, as a ‘panacea’ to educational problems, obscures vital issues of power and control that may only become apparent once the initiative is fully integrated at the classroom level. Drawing initially on the work of Foucault, and then Poster’s more recent conception of the electronic ‘SuperPanopticon’, this paper re-examines the basis of the NGfL and its role in extending and reinforcing existing power configurations in education. The paper concludes by considering directions for future research into the NGfL, and educational use of the Internet in the light of this analysis."

This article looks at the technology that allows for the sharing of TM databases over the internet to find out how it shapes the translator’s working environment. It shows that so-called pre-translation–until now the standard way for clients to manage translation tasks with freelancers–is giving way to web-interactive translation. Thus, rather than interacting with their own desktop databases as before, translators now interface with each other through server-based translation memories, so that a newly entered term or segment can be retrieved moments later by another translator working at a remote site. The study finds that, while the interests of most stakeholders in the localisation process are well served by this web-based arrangement, it can involve drawbacks for freelancers. Once an added value, technical expertise becomes less of a determining factor in employability, while translators lose autonomy through an inability to retain the linguistic assets they generate. Web-based TM is, therefore, seen to risk disempowering and de-skilling freelancers, relegating them from valued localisation partners to mere servants of the new technology."

Moreover, most of the applications have used the robot as an end or a passive tool of the learning activity, where the robot has been constructed or programmed. In this paper, we present a novel application of robotic technologies to education, where we use the real world situatedness of a robot to teach non-robotic related subjects, such as math and physics. Furthermore, we also provide the robot with a suitable degree of autonomy to actively guide and mediate in the development of the educational activity. We present our approach as an educational framework based on a collaborative and constructivist learning environment, where the robot is able to act as an interaction mediator capable of managing the interactions occurring among the working students. We illustrate the use of this framework by a 4-step methodology that is used to implement two educational activities. These activities were tested at local schools with encouraging results. Accordingly, the main contributions of this work are: i) A novel use of a mobile robot to illustrate and teach relevant concepts and properties of the real world; ii) A novel use of robots as mediators that autonomously guide an educational activity using a collaborative and constructivist learning approach; iii) The implementation and testing of these ideas in a real scenario, working with students at local schools."

The questions were analyzed according to their topic, thinking level, motivation for and level of autonomy in raising the question, the object of interest and its magnitude, and psychological distance of the object in question from the asker. Characteristics of the asker, such as gender, grade level, and country of origin were also considered, alongside characteristics of the data source, such as language, setting (Internet, school, TV), and the potential science-attentiveness of the users. Six meta-clusters of children’s and adolescents’ interest in science were identified using cluster analysis of their self-generated science questions. A developmental shift in interest from non-classical to classical school science subjects was noted. Other age-related developments, such as an increase in thinking level as reflected by the questions, a decrease in organization level and the psychological distance of the object in question with age were also explored. Advantages and shortcomings of web-based data collection for educational research are discussed, as are the implications of the results obtained using this methodology for formal science education. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci Teach 46: 999–1022, 2009"

Charland \nPsychiatric labeling has been the subject of considerable ethical debate. Much of it has centered on issues associated with the application of psychiatric labels. In comparison, far less attention has been paid to issues associated with the removal of psychiatric labels. Ethical problems of this last sort tend to revolve around identity. Many sufferers are reticent to relinquish their iatrogenic identity in the face of official label change; some actively resist it. New forms of this resistance are taking place in the private chat rooms and virtual communities of the Internet, a domain where consumer autonomy reigns supreme. Medical sociology, psychiatry, and bioethics have paid little attention to these developments. Yet these new consumer-driven initiatives actually pose considerable risks to consumers. They also present complex ethical challenges for researchers. Clinically, there is even sufficient evidence to wonder whether the Internet may be the nesting ground for a new kind of identity disturbance. The purpose of the present discussion is to survey these developments and identify potential issues and problems for future research. Taken as a whole, the entire episode suggests that we may have reached a turning point in the history of psychiatry where consumer autonomy and the Internet are now powerful new forces in the manufacture of madness"

Specifically, it increased student autonomy, due to factors including increased student access to external resources, technical difficulties arising when students all tried to do the exact same thing on the Internet, and a reversal of the usual knowledge disparity between teachers and students. Internet use also frequently resulted unexpectedly in warmer and less ad-versarial teacher-student relations, due to factors including the tendency for Internet use to lead to small group work which in turn personalized student-teacher relations, increased student enjoyment and motivation, teachers’ discovery of unexpected Internet skills on the part of students who had not otherwise impressed them, and increased autonomy, which influenced the affective tone of student-teac…"

The analysis uses cultural dimensions adopted from both the works of Hofstede and Schwartz, while controlling for country e-readiness and median population age. The findings suggest that culture’s influence may be moderated by the media richness and type of network focus of each SNS. Overall, in rich-media SNSs, egalitarianism positively impacts ATS. Individualism and masculinity only impact ATS on friendship-oriented SNSs. Additionally, uncertainty avoidance and intellectual autonomy only impact ATS on professional-oriented SNSs."

In this paper, I will argue, not surprisingly, that it is both. Our own research at the Centre for Language and Communication Studies at Trinity College Dublin over the past 4 years has provided us with valuable insights on the relationship between pedagogy and technology. On the one hand, our centre has for years been actively involved in shaping the concept of learner autonomy, not least through the writings of the centre’s founder, David Little. On the other hand, our involvement in the tandem network and tandem learning as an implementation of learner autonomy principles has given us first-hand experience in various computer-mediated forms of language learning, especially e-mail and object-oriented multi-user domains (MOOs). This paper will first look at three different approaches to learner autonomy: an individual-cognitive, a social-interactive, and an experimental-partici…"

In this conceptual paper, we explore the effect of ICT on employees in the context of the software services industry in India. We unpack the role of characteristics of service interaction in determining whether the use of ICT leads to improved or deterioration in work–family balance by investigating factors such as frequency and duration of interaction, and the temporal and cultural distance between the service provider employees and client. We argue that while the ICT media, geographical and temporal distance may enhance the need for longer customer interaction and work time, employee autonomy can potentially help harness the flexibility of the ICT advances to mitigate the detrimental impact on employ…"

The extensive use of personal data in digital networks poses a serious threat to the user’s right of privacy not only at the level of a user’s data integrity and security but also at the level of a user’s identity and freedom. In normative ethical theory the need for an informational self-deterministic approach of privacy is stressed with greater emphasis on the control over personal data. However, scant attention has been paid on a virtue ethics approach of information privacy. Plotinus’ discussion of self-determination is related to ethical virtue, human freedom and intellectual autonomy. The Plotinian virtue ethics approach of self-determination is not primarily related to the sphere of moral action, but to the quality of the self prior to moral practice. In this paper, it is argued that the problem of information privacy should be reconsidered in the light of Plotinus’ virtue ethics and his notion of self-determination."

The single representative case study method was applied, by analysing a Brazilian company within the pharmaceutical sector, which has a policy of providing smartphones to its senior executives. Data were collected from: questionnaires filled out by fourteen executives of the company in question; in-depth interviews conducted with five of these executives and e-mails sent by them via smartphones over a given period of time. After consolidation and analysis of the data obtained, it was seen that two paradoxes were strongly related to the use of smartphones by the executives in question, namely: continuity vs. asynchronicity and autonomy vs. addiction. Furthermore, three other paradoxes were moderately associated with the use of smartphones by the executives in question, namely freedom vs. enslavement, dependence vs. independence, and planning vs. improvisation. Lastly, the implications and limitations of the research are set forth."

Typical execution behavior in this type of converged schemes comprises a network of autonomous peers interacting with each other. Modeling and analyzing the interactions among different services is a crucial problem in this domain. It is a particularly challenging task since no single party has access to the internal states of all the participants. Desired behaviors have to be specified as constraints on the interactions among different peers since the interactions are the only observable global behavior. Besides, it might be meaningful to specify the interactions among different parties before the services are implemented. Undeniably, one of the main requirements is preserving the autonomy of each participating partner during the interaction, without restricting the overall goals of the common process. Thus, mechanisms orchestrating distributed service workflows are needed. The scenario-based framework for perceiving crossbreed service interactions examined in this paper efforts to meet these requirements."

It gives a general overview of the social consequences and ethical issues arising from technologies that can currently be reasonably expected. This overview is used to present recommendations and integrate these in a framework of responsible innovation. Design/methodology/approach The identification of emerging ICTs and their ethical consequences is based on the review and analysis if several different bodies of literature. The individual features of the ICTs and the ethical issues identified this way are then aggregated and analysed. Findings The paper outlines the 11 ICTs identified. Some of the shared features that are likely to have social relevance include an increase in natural interaction, the invisibility of technology, direct links between humans and technology, detailed models and data of humans and an increasing autonomy of technology that may lead to power over the user. Ethical issues include several current topics such as privacy, data protection, intellectual property and digital divides. New problems may include changes to the way humans are perceived and the role of humans and technology in society. This includes changing power structures and different ways of treating humans. Research limitations/implications The paper presents a piece of foresight research which cannot claim exact knowledge of the future. However, by developing a detailed understanding of possible futures it provides an important basis for current decisions relating to future technology development and governance. Practical implications The paper spells out a range of recommendations for both policy makers and researchers/industry. These refer to the framework within which technology is developed and how such a framework could be designed to allow the development of ethical reflexivity. Social implications The work described here is likely to influence EU policy on ICT research and technology research and innovation more broadly. This may have implications for the type of technologies funded and broad implications for the social use of emerging technologies. Originality/value The paper presents a novel and important broad view of the future of ICTs that is required in order to inform current policy decisions."

This study applied a conceptual framework derived from family development and human ecology theory to investigate family characteristics related to the likelihood of such conflicts. A secondary analysis was conducted of a special survey of 754 children aged 12 to 17 who used the Internet, and of their parents, performed by Pew Internet and the American Life project. Adolescent–parent conflicts over Internet use proved strongly related to the perception that the adolescent was a computer expert. Families in which adolescents were considered experts in new technologies were more likely to experience conflicts. Parents’ attempt to reduce adolescent autonomy by regulating the time of Internet use increased the likelihood of family arguments over the Internet. Intergenerational conflicts over th…"

Our research focuses on how to blend these elements efficiently with the different theoretical and practical content layers of an introductory course “Teaching English as a Foreign Language” to foster the development of critical, reflective thinking of prospective teachers of English and to empower the learners. In this paper we discuss the concept of autonomy as a course strategy and argue that enabling a student to take responsibility and to make informed choices is the main route to an autonomous learner. We introduce and analyze learning activities such as working with multimedia-based case stories that include video episodes as situational anchors and conducting an einterview. These learning activities are two formats that integrate elearning and contact learning in a directed, interactive way to foster the learner’s autonomy. The study is a follow-up of a pilot study on blended learning in a teacher training course and was conducted as action research in the 2004/05 winter semester. It combines qualitative and quantitative research methods and integrates multiple perspectives on the teaching and learning scenarios."

Minutolo \nA review of the academic research in corporate social responsibility shows little work on small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in the U.S. whereas considerable work in this domain has been conducted in the European context. This study seeks to make a contribution to the research void by addressing one particular area of social responsibility in the U.S. context. Specifically, we employ Ajzen’s reasoned action approach to begin to build an understanding of what promotes leaders of SMEs to reduce waste. This study addresses several questions: What are the attitudes of owners and managers of SMEs toward waste reduction practices for their organizations? How are stakeholder interests toward waste reduction perceived? And, are leaders of SMEs influenced by their industrial environment? The authors utilized an email survey directed to owners and managers of SMEs with greater than 5, but less than 500 employees in the telephony, construction, pulp and paper products, textiles, and agriculture industries. 377 emails were opened and 104 completed surveys were obtained. The survey instrument was developed from the theoretical perspective of Isaac Ajzen’s (1991) Theory of Planned Behavior in Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, p. 179-211. Results from a partial least squares analysis of the data suggest that there is a strong and significant relationship between the normative, attitudinal, and control constructs with an individual’s intention to be a socially responsible SME. This finding suggests that efforts to influence SME owners and managers to implement waste reduction activities need focus on changing individual attitudes."

    "text": "Doc 258 :  Human Autonomy, Law, and Technology \nhttps://doi.org/10.1177/0270467609355050\n Jennifer D. Chandler \nScholars of technology have long puzzled over the question of the relationship between human societies and their technologies. Technological determinism suggests that the technologies present in a society have a determining effect on the structure of that society. Critics of this idea point out that the technologies are themselves developed by people within societies and so are themselves determined by the characteristics of those societies. It may be that the influence flows in both directions. The concept of the autonomy of technology suggests that human societies do not have very effective mechanisms to control and direct their technologies. Instead, those societies are more apt to adapt their structures and values to accommodate any efficient technologies that develop. The themes of autonomy and control thus arise in various ways in the consideration of the place of technology in human societies. While the ideas of technological determinism and the autonomy of technology tend to focus on the effects of technology at the social level, it is possible to consider the questions of control and autonomy at the individual level as well. At the level of the individual, it seems clear that many technologies support human autonomy and promote freedom by expanding human capacities for action. At the same time, individual human beings paradoxically come to feel obliged to adopt particular technologies in a manner that undermines their autonomy and freedom. This series of short articles addresses the theme of human autonomy, law, and technology. In the winter of 2009, Arthur Cockfield invited a group of scholars of law and technology to continue their joint conversation on the Law and Technology Theory Blog (http://techtheory.blogspot.com/). Each of us wrote a short piece containing reflections on this theme. The short articles have been revised for inclusion here in the Bulletin and are presented in the order in which they appeared on the Blog. In the rest of this short introduction, I provide a sketch of the main themes emerging from each article. Arthur Cockfield describes the competing views, first, that technologies are merely neutral instruments that humans choose or not and, second, that technologies have pervasive and unintended effects that undermine human autonomy. He explores how these two competing views might tend to lead legal policy makers in different directions in the context of the government deployment of surveillance technologies. Frank Pasquale explores the extent to which “neurocosmetic” pharmaceuticals challenge our understanding of human liberty and autonomy. He considers the external pressures that may limit a person’s freedom to reject cognitive enhancement. More fundamentally though, he points out that to the extent that these drugs interfere with the recognition of difficult truths and feelings, they may undermine the foundation of personal autonomy. Jennifer Chandler looks at the effect of technology on human autonomy through two lenses. First, she looks at collective self-determination, as expressed in the laws that we choose for self-governance. Here, the question is whether technological ideology tends to determine legal doctrines and outcomes rather than that the law controls technology. Second, she suggests various mechanisms to explain the sense that individuals may feel constrained to adopt specific technologies whether they wish to or not. Kieran Tranter approaches the relationship between human autonomy, law, and technology using three stories. The technological story of “human as tool user” suggests that technology is the essence of humanity and emancipates humans from natural limits. The legal story tells a tale of anarchy overcome through a social contract that enabled, among other things, the flowering of technology. He proposes a critique of both these stories—the autonomy story—and argues that we have choice and responsibility for the cultural narratives that we adopt to understand our technologies. Lyria Bennett Moses turns her gaze upon legal scholars and how they have responded to technological innovation as a field of legal study. She speculates about the reasons that lawyers may rush to publish on the legal implications of the latest technology. Lawyers may be dazzled by an exciting technology, but they may also be rushing to assert the continuing relevance and importance of the law (and themselves) in a rapidly changing technological society. Lisa Austin traces the evolution of the philosophy of technology and identifies the mutual enrichment that the philosophy of technology and legal scholarship might draw from one another. She discusses a recent skirmish in the “control wars” over personal information on the Internet and proposes a reimagining of the value of privacy that is inspired by the approach of the early philosophers of technology. Sam Trosow argues that it is essential to consider economics in seeking to understand the relationship between law, technology, and other social phenomena. He addresses the important role of economic analysis in the field of intellectual property law—a field that is central to the interaction of law and technology."

Murray \nInformation and communication technology (ICT) has been used in language classrooms for more than two decades. Over this time, classroom use has moved from drill, text manipulation, and word processing to more interactive and communicative applications such as e-mail, chat, and web-based programs, requiring learners to acquire computer literacies. This chapter will begin by discussing both the parameters of ICT and the scope of literacies. It is then organized around discussion of the two types of literacies at the intersection of ICT and L2 learning: how new technologies facilitate acquisition of L2 literacies and what L2 literacies are needed for learners to participate in an increasingly digital world. Although research has mostly been limited to small-scale context-dependent case studies of individual classrooms, it has identified a number of issues that need to be considered as teachers (and learners) use ICT for language learning. Although ICT provides a natural context for learner autonomy, that autonomy needs to be developed systematically. In addition, ICT provides a context for learner identity formation through hybrid uses of language(s), in ways unexpected by teachers and learners. These new ways of using language may empower and motivate learners. Similarly, whereas ICT provides opportunities for collaboration and interaction, they are not automatic, and instruction needs to be skillfully scaffolded for learners to benefit from such opportunities."

The famine has been compounded in recent years as local newsrooms produce content for two-screen and three-screen audiences. Chaos theory says that even during chaotic times there are constants, such as deadlines and breaking news obligations. This study of 877 broadcast journalists examines their perceptions of work quality in light of organizational support, job satisfaction, work overload and autonomy. Results indicate that organizational support, job satisfaction and autonomy are significant, positive predictors of work quality. Additionally, 81% of news workers said they work differently from a few years ago, with social media/online obligations and doing-more-with-less consuming much of their time. In the meantime, diminished quality is a rising concern."

Each character perceives the surrounding world, decides how to behave and acts on the environment according to its personality and to its goals. The chief idea explored by the proposed approach is that personality has a probabilistic influence on behavior selection instead of a deterministic one. Different behavior sequences available to achieve a goal are modeled using probabilistic automata and making probability dependent on character personality. This leads to non-repetitive behaviors, whose evolution is not foreseeable. The paper first motivates the approach in the context of cybertherapy. Then, it summarizes related work and illustrates in detail the proposed approach. Finally, it presents obtained results and discusses the main limitations of the implemented system.

Greenberg \nAbstract New communication technologies are offering organizations options that were not previously available. These new opportunities have the potential to impact many aspects of the organization, including coordination and control efforts. Despite a growing literature concerning computer-mediated communication, the basic question of whether the simple switch from written to computer-mediated communication changes behavior still remains unanswered. We argue that advanced information technology has created a frame with enabling and limiting impacts that exists even when the major characteristics are not present. This paper reports the results of a laboratory experiment concerning the effects of communication medium on the process and outcomes of negotiations in a transfer pricing situation. An organizational coordination mechanism and its interactions with communication medium were also examined. Structured negotiations were communicated through written exchanges and through computerized networks where the media richness and technical system capabilities were the same in both media. The negotiation process and outcomes were both measured. The results show that communication medium does effect both the process and outcomes of negotiations, even when media richness and system capabilities are the same in both media. Computer-mediated communication took fewer rounds of negotiation to reach an agreement, leading to an improved process, but had lower outcomes with lower firm profit and lower perceived autonomy. Thus, these results support our argument that medium provides a frame that affects behavior even when the major characteristics of the medium are absent. Further, medium interacts with arbitration, demonstrating the importance of considering other coordination and control mechanisms when examining the impact of medium."

Specifically, advancements in video capturing and social media have made public events into spectacles that are observed and shared online by the public. Public protest and discourse loosens itself from the bounds of state authority and enters the arena of the public. This phenomenon reconsiders Foucault’s conception of the panopticon. Foucault’s panopticon is useful as a tool for understanding the way power operates through surveillance in a state-to-public direction, but technological advancements have allowed for a reversal of this surveillance. With real examples like the pepper spraying of student protesters at UC Davis, the public now has surveillance over the state (in this example police officers) from its multitude of citizen perspectives that can be shared and disseminated online. This is an important development because it increases the autonomy and safe power of individuals who wish to speak out against excessive use of power by the state over the public. People can do so without fear of greater police suppression of real events. Issues with this development are discussed, like the chance for the state, or other sites of power (like corporations) to develop the copyrighting of public pace, making any event the property of power structures. This would be a problem, as it would lessen the autonomy of individuals in public"

Respondents indicated that the electronic and online nature of these survey data challenges traditional research ethics principles such as consent, risk, privacy, anonymity, confidentiality, and autonomy, and adds new methodological complexities surrounding data storage, security, sampling, and survey design. Interesting discrepancies surfaced among respondents regarding strengths and weaknesses within extant guidelines, which are highlighted throughout the paper. The paper concludes with considerations and suggestions towards consistent protocol review of online surveys to ensure appropriate human subjects protections in the face of emergent electronic tools and methodologies."

The summary of articles gathered here leads to a larger collective account of personal identity that highlights embodiment and thereby the continuities between online and offline senses and experiences of selfhood. I connect this collective account with other contemporary works at the intersections between philosophy and IS, such as on trust and virtual worlds, thereby entailing further questions and debates. I close by exploring how these collective insights illuminate larger themes regarding technology—specifically, the debate between a distinctively modern Augustinian–Cartesian account emphasizing control, liberation, and immortality by way of escape from the body, vs. more contemporary alternatives in feminist, environmental, and information philosophies that highlight autonomy through, rather than against, embodiment."

The rate of adoption of cell phones in the country has been remarkably fast, and not gradual as in other nations. Yet, examination of the developmental impact of mobile phones has drawn surprisingly little attention in Sri Lanka. Therefore, this article attempts to investigate the empowering effect of mobile phones on dependent housewives in poor households of the country by using a mixed research method. Our research found that access to mobile phones was certainly empowering for these women: mobile phones unequivocally strengthened and expanded their social circle and support networks; they led them to domesticate technology, thus challenging negative societal attitudes toward women as technologically incompetent and timid; they reduced women’s information poverty; and opened them up to a newer, non-traditional fun space, which was a clear manifestation of choice and power. However, the women’s use of mobile phones was largely controlled within the household, mainly because they did not have their own income to maintain the phones, thus underlining the need for their financial autonomy. Those women who owned their mobile phones had more control over them than those who lacked legal ownership. To conclude, mobile phones can play a significant role in empowering poor women in Sri Lanka, and can be considered as a tool in the policy agenda for women’s empowerment by the government.

Much research shows great progress has been made in the multimedia environment. However, it does not necessarily follow that there exist no problems in multimedia-based teaching. In order to further improve teaching, the application of Internet technology has begun to gain more and more attention in recent years.This paper probes into the application of web in teaching. A 16-week experiment between the experimental group and the control group is conducted. Based on the comparison of the two tests that the two groups had before and after the experiment and an face-to-face interview, the author finds out that the web-based model can not only help the learners perform better but also enhance their autonomy and independent thinking in learning, and so is their learning interest."

Operating in an environment characterized by the conditions of globalization and late modernity, the movement strives to be a collective that accommodates individual difference. Focusing on the organizing process of the European Social Forum, this article examines the role of email lists and physical meetings in realizing this ‘unity in diversity’. Based on interviews with movement activists and a content analysis of three email lists, this article examines how online and face-to-face communication practices engender different dynamics in terms of individuality and collectiveness. While communication on email lists tends to afford divergence, diversity, and individual autonomy, face-to-face contact enables convergence, unity and the affirmation of the collective. Thus, it is the combination of those two modes of communication that helps the movement to fuse seemingly opposing dynamics."

Whilst informatics and telemedicine are important developments, the potential for adverse organisational and societal effects should be recognised and anticipated. Health organisations are frequently seen as circumscribed networks, and these in turn form local alliances with related organisations. Information technologies are frequently construed as relating to operational systems within organisations, not least electronic patient record systems and diagnostic systems. These can then be linked to new generation health business systems, to provide accurate management information at low additional cost. However, this pair of assumptions is now seriously flawed, due to the effects of the latest developments in health informatics and telemedicine. In particular, telecommunications and Internet technologies render ineffectual previous external barriers of distance and national boundaries, whilst within the organisation the combination of knowledge bases with information technologies creates tendencies towards internal autonomy. Organisational and national policy control of health care face direct and radical challenges through perverse effects of otherwise beneficial developments, and early action is needed."

Castells (2009) contended that social networking sites offer a form of mass communication of the self wherein individuals can acquire a new creative autonomy. Stiegler (2009) and the Ars Industrialis collective believe that the processes of individuation, and of speaking out, hold the key to empowerment, agency, and resistance. In this article the authors offer a critical reflection on the logic of mediated participation promoted by social media through a consideration of the differences between individual and collective forms of mediated political participation. Drawing on ethnographic research on alternative media within the Trade Union Movement in Britain and recent research on the political culture of social networking sites, the authors argue that far from being empowering, the logic of self-centered participation promoted by social media can represent a threat for political groups rather than an opportunity."

O’Connor \n Sheryl O. Hughes \n Cassandra S. Diep \n Janice Baranowski \nThis study reports the modeling of three categories of ineffective vegetable parenting practices (IVPP) separately (responsive, structure, and control vegetable parenting practices). An internet survey was employed for a cross sectional assessment of parenting practices and cognitive-emotional variables. Parents (n=307) of preschool children (3-5 years old) were recruited through announcements and postings. Models were analyzed with block regression and backward deletion procedures using a composite IVPP scale as the dependent variable. The independent variables included validated scales from a Model of Goal Directed Vegetable Parenting Practices (MGDVPP), including: intention, habit, perceived barriers, desire, competence, autonomy, relatedness, attitudes, norms, perceived behavioral control, and anticipated emotions. The available scales accounted for 26.5%, 16.7% and 44.6% of the variance in the IVPP responsive, structure and control subscales, respectively. Different sets of diverse variables predicted the three IVPP constructs. Intentions, Habits and Perceived Behavioral Control were strong predictors for each of the IVPP constructs, but the subscales were specific to each IVPP construct. Parent emotional responses, an infrequently investigated variable, was an important predictor of ineffective responsive vegetable parenting practices and ineffective structure vegetable parenting practices, but not ineffective control vegetable parenting practices. An Attitude subscale and a Norms subscale predicted ineffective responsive vegetable parenting practices alone. This was the first report of psychometrically tested scales to predict use of IVPP subscales. Further research is needed to verify these findings in larger longitudinal cohorts. Interventions to increase child vegetable intake may have to reduce IVPP."

The analysis argues that the Internet provides the resources and environment necessary for cohesive organized resistance to corporate culture across the domains of production (labor issues) and consumption issues (marketing).

However, the query how absorptive capacity transforms R&D investment into firm innovation, in the context of autonomous R&D climate remains unclear. Using 165 firms in the Taiwan’s information and communication technology industry, the results indicate that absorptive capacity partially mediates the relationship between R&D investment and firm innovation. Absorptive capacity accounts for 36% effects of R&D investment on firm innovation. The result also shows a negative moderating effect of R&D autonomy on the relationship between absorptive capacity and firm innovation."

Focusing on the context of this technology’s development, and the strategic issues behind its design, implementation and operation, control devolution as a design strategy is explored. This analysis draws on insights presented by Claudio Ciborra’s in his study of the change from alignment to loose coupling in the Swiss multinational Hoffmann-La Roche. This paper illustrates how control is played out on different levels, and balanced against autonomy. The theoretical implications of this paper highlight how the differences and transformations between information systems and information infrastructures are conceptualised, with the development of the latter better understood in light of a balance between control and autonomy. Consequently, it is suggested that control devolution as a design approach should be based on a deep understanding of the existing control/autonomy balance as well as the distribution of resources, risks and the ability and willingness to innovate."

For this purpose a self‐access centre (SAC) was set up where students themselves decide on the kinds of learning activities they wish to participate in at the centre. This weekly 1 hour session is built into the curriculum so that all students, regardless of their English proficiency, have the opportunity to develop autonomy in their learning. Unlike traditional self‐access centres, where worksheets usually form the core resource, the SAC at NIE taps resources from the Internet.

It seeks to focus attention on the idea of autonomy and the questioning of this idea that rests within the practice and to demonstrate how this questioning ultimately resolves into a concern with epistemology and with the question of how we can describe the world around us without any point of reference external to ourselves. This article will also suggest an alternative perspective on the principles which govern archival description, namely that they should be seen as an injunction to account for the point of view in points of view. Moreover, that such principles should be seen as governing archival description, not in the sense of directing archivists how to describe archives, but rather in the sense of being an archival expression of the check that governs, the epistemological question inherent in, all our descriptions."

Machiel Van der Loos \nIntroduction: As applications of robotics extend to areas that directly impact human life, such as the military and eldercare, the deployment of autonomous and semi-autonomous robots increasingly requires the input of stakeholder opinions. Up to now, technological deployment has been relying on the guidance of government/military policy and the healthcare system without specific incorporation of professional and lay opinion. Methods: This paper presents results from a roboethics study that uses the unique N-Reasons scenario-based survey instrument. The instrument collected Yes, No, Neutral responses from more than 250 expert and lay responders via the Internet along with their ethics-content reasons for the answers, allowing the respondents to agree to previously-provided reasons or to write their own. Data from three questions relating to military and eldercare robots are analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Results: The survey reveals that respondents weigh the appropriateness of robotics technology deployment in concert with the level of autonomy conferred upon it. The accepted level of robot autonomy does not appear to be solely dependent on the perceived efficiency and effectiveness of the technology, but is subject to the robot’s relationship with the public’s principle-based reasons and the application field in focus. Conclusion: The N-Reasons instrument was effective in eliciting ethical commentary in a simple, on-line survey format and provides insights into the interactions between the issues that respondents consider across application and technology boundaries."

This requires a radical departure from traditional language teaching practices. Japanese students need to develop learner autonomy and the skills to use authentic language texts in a cooperative learning context so that they can develop the intellectual and social skills to use English as an authentic global language among Japanese language speakers. Students at a women’s college in western Japan used an Australian junior high school social science text and personal and internet resources to put these principles into practice. Small permanent groups of students chose their own areas of study in designated topic areas, engaged in collaborative research, and presented their group findings in posters supported by oral and written reports. Diaries provided students with an effective means of reporting their understanding of the learning strategies employed to the teacher. The group discussions of the collected strategies helped students expand their working knowledge of English."

Two key issues are explored. The first concerns the politics of the alter-globalisation movements—what they demand and how they practise their aims. The second concerns the potential of information and communication technologies (ICTs) to provide a space within which to build a radical politics. Several dilemmas facing Indymedia and alter-globalisation movements emerge from this analysis. First, there remain many limitations of using ICTs as a space for the constitution of a radical politics. Second, Indymedia collectives have had success in aligning their aims to their practices; however, informal hierarchies did form around editorial decisions and technical skills. Third, there is continued potential for these movements to appear exclusive. In this respect, simply being ‘open’ is not enough to widen these spaces of resistance.

It is a necessity to achieve new knowledge, information and skills via appropriate retraining. A training system is the method which gives chances of retraining to public librarians. After examining some of the problems with the existing training system, it is apparent that the direction of training system needs to be decentralized. That is each local branch should be autonomous in terms of new training for librarians. For the method of training system, each autonomous unit would integrate the different theories to apply to the community-at-large and invite practical specialists from the local community to lecture. The training classes would be elective in that the each librarian could choose the classes he/she wants to take and give them credits for that, but the certificate for the class would also go towards completion for the required technical training. Finally, the utilization of cyber-education should be introduced, and the library association`s role strengthened, to help public librarians cultivate their specialties."

Opposing to this idea, we believe that such autonomy lies not in technology, but in communication as a human creation, mediated by technology. It about analyzed communication, not as a systemic view, but from the point of view of complexity as Morin (2007) and Bar-Yam (2004) defined. This is another understanding of cyberculture that makes us realize the existence of a subjective interaction network, whose main characteristic is the constant negotiation between personal expression and collective conceptions, transiting on the web and generating vectors of change and transformation in the information society. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate how communication generates vectors of change from large unpredictable information flows, like the subjective interaction networks.

Using unique data from 6,009 Russian-language internet freelancers, who are typically both autonomous contractors and teleworkers, we make two key contributions. We found evidence to support the demand-resource model among self-employed professionals who typically have autonomy and control over their time, although these processes differ somewhat by gender. We also argue that overall life satisfaction is a significant influence on satisfaction with work-life balance and also acts as a mediator for the influence of some demands and resources on both male and female freelancers’ satisfaction with work-life balance. Implications for future research and social policy are discussed."

Qualitative analysis of in-depth interview data from 49 users suggests that Cyworld users routinely negotiate multiple dialectical tensions that are created within the online world, transferred from face-to-face contexts, or imposed by interpersonal principles that relate to Korea’s collectivistic culture. The interviewees experienced a new relational dialectic of interpersonal relations versus self-relation, analogous to Baxter and Montgomery’s 1996 connection-autonomy contradiction. Their responses suggest that Cyworld’s design features and functions encourage users to transcend the high-context communication of Korean culture by offering an alternative channel for elaborate and emotional communication, which fosters the reframing of relational issues offline. Cy-Ilchons online buddies virtually extend the Korean cultural concept of blood ties, called yons, in ways that intensify the openness-closedness contradiction at early stages of relationship formation."

For this reason the aim of the present study was to investigate the association between psychological well-being dimensions and problematic use of Internet communicative services. In the current study 495 undergraduate students were recruited. The Italian adaptations of the Psychological Well-being Scales and the Generalized Problematic Internet Use Scale 2 (GPIUS2) were used to assess psychological well-being dimensions and generalized problematic Internet use, respectively. Psychological well-being dimensions explained a significant portion of variance for the GPIUS2 total score levels, after controlling for sex, age, and occupational status. The levels of Autonomy, Environmental Mastery, and Positive Relations with Others acted as significant negative predictors of the tendency to use the web for regulating negative feelings, compulsive use of the web, and the negative outcomes that can arise as a result. The overall findings of the present study provide preliminary evidence that low psychological well-being is associated with problematic use of Internet communicative services."

This study examines the association between job characteristics and a particular form of personal Internet use at work, personal online communication (POC). The study analyzes data of the 2008 Networked Workers Survey sponsored by the Pew Internet & American Life Project. The results demonstrate that job characteristics explain a large, significant portion of the variance of POC at work. The findings suggest that for jobs with high knowledge intensity, managing POC could be approached from a work–life balance perspective. The study also suggests that changes in work structure, job variety, and autonomy could have significant implications for managing POC activities in the wired workplace."

At issue for this study is to what extent these ‘technological classrooms’ are providing a positive learning environment for students. To investigate this issue, this study involved an evaluation of the physical and psychosocial environments in computerized school settings through a combination of questionnaires and inventories that were later cross-referenced to case studies on a subset of these classrooms. Data were obtained from a series of physical evaluations of 43 settings in 24 school locations in British Columbia, Canada and Western Australia. Evaluations consisted of detailed inventories of the physical environment using the Computerised Classroom Environment Inventory (CCEI): an instrument developed specifically for this study. Data on psychosocial aspects of the environment were obtained with the What is Happening in this Class? (WIHIC) questionnaire administered to 1404 high school students making routine use of these computerized classrooms. Potential deficiencies in the physical environment of these locations included problems with individual workspaces, lighting and air quality, whereas deficiencies in the psychosocial environment were confined to the dimension of Autonomy. Further analysis of these classroom environment data indicated that student Autonomy and Task orientation were independently associated with students’ Satisfaction with learning and that many physical (e.g. lighting and workspace dimensions) and psychosocial factors (e.g. students’ perceptions of Co-operation and Collaboration) were also associated. The results provide a descriptive account of the learning environment in ‘technology-rich’ classrooms and, further, indicate that ergonomic guidelines used in the implementation of IT in classrooms may have a positive influence on the learning environment."

Many researchers claim that Smartphones can have negative consequences in the workplace such as lowering productivity, separating people from their realities, bringing stress from personal issues to work, and creating bad manners. Companies, however, have a difficult time mandating a policy in regards to prohibiting the use of Smartphones. Therefore, CEOs and corporate leaders should encourage their employees to use their Smartphones as tools for increasing their company’s efficiency. This research aims to examine the results of the use of Smartphones in the workplace as integrated internal connection tools. Using Smartphones in the workplace can be valuable in three ways: promoting autonomy, strengthening relationships with peers as well as superiors, and improving knowledge-sharing. Moreover, these three main factors can increase employee job satisfaction, which leads to better efficiency in the workplace. Organizations will be better able to successfully adapt with changes that are occurring every day by integrating the use of Smartphones in the workplace."

This effort has been strengthened by the capacities of computers to draw upon the tools of artificial intelligence (AI) and operations research. However, work on AI and the law entails crucial ethical issues concerning both values and modalities of design. On one hand, design choices might result in conflicts of values and, vice versa , values may affect design features. On the other hand, the modalities of design cannot only limit the impact of harm-generating behavior but also prevent such behavior from occurring via self-enforcement technologies. In order to address some of the most relevant issues of data protection today, the paper suggests we adopt a stricter, yet more effective version of “privacy by design.” The goal should be to reinforce people‟s pre-existing autonomy, rather than having to build it from scratch."

Using nationally representative data from the 2008 Networked Worker Survey, we examine how teamwork, telework, and information and communication technology use are associated with, and positively and significantly predict, job decision latitude (autonomy and skill development). The results imply that networked work helps enhance job decision latitude partly through greater network connectivity (social capital). Furthermore, the contribution of information and communication technology use to job decision latitude is contingent on its perceived benefits and on the organization of work into teams. These findings therefore help deepen our understanding of how the changing character of work affects worker control in contemporary workplaces."

Lasome \n Janice B. Agazio \nComputer-mediated communication, or email, has become a common workplace practice. Interviews with Army nurse managers (n = 9) and their staff nurses (n = 13) revealed that nurses incorporate the ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice into their computer-mediated communication use, but to varying degrees. Without clearly defined policies to guide computer-mediated communication practices, informal norms evolve that have an impact on both individual and corporate communication. The authors provide insight into the ethical considerations that have an impact on computer-mediated communication use. The spectrum of participant interpretation of appropriate use of this type of communication suggests the need for policies to establish clear boundaries for workplace usage. Policy recommendations are included."

Kommers \n Bert F. Lenting \n G.C. van der Veer \nCSCL (Computer Supported Co‐operative Learning), better called TSCL, Telematic (and IT) Supported Co‐operative Learning, seems to be driven by both social dynamics (like the tendency to reduce the formal training component in industrial settings, and have it replaced by training on the job, handling EPSS, etc) and technological facilities like Internet‐based communication tools. This paper reports a recent research plan that anticipates the situation where individual learners, all having their individual learning agendas, look for partners in their learning process. TSCL, then, can assist those learners to announce them to the learning community, and also find appropriate partners to co‐operate with. As far as educational institutes are concerned, we expect them to increase the level of autonomy for the learner. Teaching in this case becomes ‘facilitating the information access to the learner’ and ‘facilitating the communication between actors in the learning process’."

It is hoped officials and advocates recognize IT related certification programs (NSSB Recognizes First IT Certification Program 2002). The Internet and Computing Core Certification (IC3®) certification program is designed for individuals to develop digital literacy skills, including fundamental computer and Internet use. The particular interest of the study is to explore the relative contributions of the Certification Recognition Program (CRP) and associated autonomy of participation and achieved literacy for internet computing & technology (ICT), as well as the interactive influences of the degree programs and grade levels. Five hundred and ninety six male undergraduates majoring in IT were invited to participate in the Certification Recognition Program for a calendar year. The certification recognition program covers a set of three standardized tests based on the IC3® by CertiportTM. The study found ICT literacy is predicated by the students’ autonomy of participation (AP) in the Certification Recognition Program (CRP), and SP was related to the grade level (GL) and the enrolled degree program (DP), indirectly affecting ICT literacy as a result of the transiting effect of AP."

The analyzed materials were eight discussions promoted by students, professors, and monitors in the chat session of TelEduc LMS. The software NVivo was used to categorize data and Content Analysis for the analysis of information. Data analysis used Freire as a reference point, revealing that nursing students need to develop their autonomy by acknowledging their incompleteness. Professors can aid this process by problematizing and developing critical dialogical relations. The potential of the educational chat as a pedagogical tool is highlighted because it encourages students to autonomously seek knowledge."

Powell \nOne of the most contentious issues involving federal, state, and local relations today is Internet taxation. Internet taxation is a significant battleground because it involves issues of great import to federalism, including state and local autonomy and revenue adequacy. Since the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1992 decision in Quill v. North Dakota, the taxability of online transactions has been governed by the court’s physical presence nexus rule. This nexus rule has recently been called into question by various organizations, corporations, and elected officials. Proposals to alter the nexus rule abound from various sources. This article examines the roles played by these various actors in the Internet taxation debate and explores the potential implications of changes to the nexus forfederalism and intergovernmental relations."

Information on the internet has in fact a ubiquitous nature that transcends political borders and questions the notion of the law as made of commands enforced through physical sanctions. Whereas many of today’s impasses on jurisdiction, international conflicts of law and diverging interpretations of statutes can be addressed by embedding legal safeguards in ICT and other kinds of technology, to overcome the ineffectiveness of state action by design entails its own risks, e.g., threats of paternalism hinging on the regulatory tools of technology. Rather than modelling people’s behaviour by design, the article suggests that design policies should respect individual and collective autonomy by decreasing the impact of harm-generating behaviour (e.g., security measures and default settings for data protection), or by widening the range of people’s choices (e.g., user friendly interfaces)."

As a result, parents may paradoxically be viewed as passive victims and therefore reduced to be the spectators of what is supposed to be their ‘problem’. The present study analyses dominant parent advice texts in the Flemish community of Belgium, as well as the voices of parents on the Internet. The study confirms the tendencies noticed in critical literature: the tendency to individualize responsibilities and the focus on autonomy in the neoliberal era. In addition it unveils the double bind nature of autonomy in expert discourse. It also illustrates the performative agency of parents, as co-constructors of dominant discourse as well as contesting this discourse. In so doing, the study complements the existing vein of literature with the way in which parents think of and experience the dominant parenting discourse."

Moss-Racusin \n Julie E. Phelan \n Jennifer Crocker \nDeriving self-worth from romantic relationships (relationship contingency) may have implications for women’s sexual motives in relationships. Because relationship contingency enhances motivation to sustain relationships to maintain positive self-worth, relationship contingent women may engage in sex to maintain and enhance their relationships (relational sex motives). Using structural equation modeling on Internet survey data from a convenience sample of 462 women in heterosexual and lesbian relationships, we found that greater relationship contingency predicted greater relational sex motives, which simultaneously predicted both sexual satisfaction and dissatisfaction via two distinct motivational states. Having sex to improve intimacy with one’s partner was associated with greater sexual satisfaction and autonomy, while having sex to earn partner’s approval was associated with sexual dissatisfaction and inhibition. While some differences exist between lesbian and heterosexual relationships, relationship contingency had sexual costs and benefits, regardless of relationship type."

It suggests that anonymity and deindividuation are facets of opportunity and means of reducing the likelihood that normal constraints will interfere and questions their position as causative elements of computer mediated crime. It suggests that the control balance theory can help to understand why there may be high levels of computer crime and why individuals who might refrain from deviance in the real world may participate in deviant behaviour on-line. Finally, there are tentative suggestions for policy initiatives as well as a recognition that both these and the application of control balance in this area would benefit from further analysis."

In an effort to address this important question, this article suggests three mentorship modes that educators can employ in order to effectively engage with today’s interactive learners. Lecture-based instruction is a single mode form of teaching in which information is disseminated by a lone authority-figure. In contrast, learning-centered mentorship is a three-mode process in which autonomy is shared and authority flows in multiple directions at once: bottom-up (modeling), laterally (collaborating), and topdown (organizing and supervising). This work draws on research and theories related to student-centered pedagogy, as well as the trial and error experimentation of the author and interviews with successful participatory educators working at Tribeca Flashpoint Media Arts Academy in Chicago, a school devoted almost exclusively to problem-based and project-based learning."

We urgently need new strategies for large scale physical and cognitive rehabilitation in our aging societies. The size of the need, however, contrasts with the scarcity of resources of the existing health systems. The degree of dependence on the activities of the daily living (ADLs) and the measure of cognitive impairment are good health indicators. Computation and cooperative networking can be extremely instrumental to help meet the demands of daily life. Health promotion might be well supported by interactive devices like personal computers, cell phones, global positioning devices, and electronic banking. These technologies can be reached by the Internet, ubiquitous computation, artificial intelligence, and telecommunications and they can be fundamental to maintain autonomy and independence of cognitively impaired people, helping them through their ADLs. Digital inclusion of the aged and cognitively impaired is a promising challenge, and should be based on the sound principles of human-computer interaction, networking, neuroscience and gerontology. The core objective is to construct environments that could empower cognitively impaired people and Alzheimer´s patients, enabling them to exercise their citizenship, participate and share with their community their life experiences and aspirations."

In-depth, semi-structured interviews are conducted with the staff of the organization. Results show that the key values that guide the operations include independence from government, journalistic objectivity and balance as well as reader education. The perceived effectiveness of NGO international news service is much higher than government-sponsored news programs in terms of reaching audiences, affecting elite groups and return of investment. The factors that affect the effectiveness include use of local journalists and editors as decision-makers, the Internet, censorship by governments of the target region, vision of the NGO leaders, dialogue approach, non-governmental funding, and target elite niche audience."

Ajit \nPaulo Freire’s classical book Pedagogy of the Oppressed (1968), written in Portuguese, calls for a pedagogy that would assume a new relationship between student, teacher and society. Freire christens traditional peda- gogy a banking system, for it considers the student an empty shell waiting to be filled with knowledge, like a piggy bank. He argues strongly for education to treat the student a co-creator of knowledge. The younger generation need not meekly accept society’s status quo and education should help them to deal with reality critically and creatively so that they can transform their worlds. This paper explores how a tech savvy student can learn a new language, based on the dictum of Friere, using smartphone apps such as Mango and Mosalingua. It explains how a gadget like smartphone can offer learner autonomy which guarantees vocabulary enrichment, pronunciation models, visualization, and comprehension of cultural complexities in respect of a new language. Smartphones and Tablets have revolutionized our way of living. Initially, we were only aware of such applications as emails and search engines. But with the advent of new breeds of smart- phones, thousands of new applications are being uploaded into the Android and the iOS markets. Only the creme de la creme of the population knows about the benefits and the usage of these applications. A majority of students are unaware of the existence of these applications, which can be used as part of cus- tomized learning pedagogy where the learner can learn at his/ her own pace and convenience. In this context, the relationship between the power of smartphone applications and a theory of pedagogy meant for the support of the oppressed needs our keen attention. Pedagogy of the Oppressed Paulo Freire’s Pedagogy of the Oppressed was written at the time of decolonization when former colonies like Africa, Asia, and Latin America became autonomous countries. Decoloniza- tion is an important subject of the book. This book is not about nation’s transformation but about individual and collective hu- man development. The discussion is about the internal colo- nization which is nothing but being oppressed even after the colonial forces and the military forces have left the state. The colonization discourses still remain. Still there are such ques- tions around as, which culture, caste, or language is superior to other? Freire’s book is about healing the self. The important issue in it is how the pedagogy of the oppressed helps people to coun- ter the internal oppression. It tells us about a pedagogy which can help people, especially students, from oppression. There are two propositions. The first one is to identify the subject dis- courses like the economic and social ties that keep people down. The second proposition is that transformation of the oppressed is possible when such people can liberate themselves from op- pression."

Acquisitions are a means of complementing and renewing the knowledge base of the firm. In this study we analyse different variables of the implementation process (autonomy, retention, interaction, cultural similarity) in three acquisitions. We observe that the degree of autonomy granted to the acquired firm is influenced by the nature of the knowledge to be transferred, whereas retention and the means of interaction are not. The results with regard to cultural similarity are not conclusive."

Vallerand \n Emmanuel Paty \n Lucie Gobancé \n Sophie Berjot \nAbstract Recently, Hagger, Chatzisarantis, Hein, Pihu, Soos, and Karsai (2007) presented a new questionnaire, the Perceived Autonomy Support Scale for Exercise Settings (PASSES), designed to evaluate perceived autonomy support toward exercise. The present research investigated the psychometric properties of a French adaptation of this scale to the sport setting in two studies. In Study 1, the French version of the PASSES (i.e., I’Echelle des Perceptions du Soutien a I’Autonomie en Sport; EPSAS) was adapted for sport and completed by 134 athletes. Results of an exploratory factor analysis revealed a unidimensional structure with factor loadings ranging from .63 to .85. Results also showed satisfactory internal consistency (qc = .91). In Study 2 (N = 203), a confirmatory factor analysis provided further support for the unidimensional structure of the questionnaire. Convergent validity of the instrument was also obtained through correlations with meaningful constructs, namely intrinsic motivation and identif…"

The investigated student was 14 years old and attended the 7th grade of elementary school in 2012. The guiding question of this research was: can a person with a mild level of Intellective Special Educational Needs overcome cognitive difficulties in Mathematics involving an electronic didactic sequence? We emphasize the importance of neuroscience advances in educational process of people with Intellective Special Educational Needs, the multimodality of stimuli offered by Information and Communication Technology and the frameworks from the experiment results carried out between 2010 and 2012, with weekly meetings between researchers and the student, which indicate an evolution related to mathematical concepts such as cardinality, ordinality, place value, additive structure, comprehension of units of time, Brazilian monetary system and resolution of problems involving these concepts, especially those related to the additive field."

This paper discusses the essential elements of accountability identified by the Galway Accountability Project, with scholarship from the Centre for Information Policy Leadership at Hunton & Williams LLP. Conceptual Privacy by Design principles are offered as criteria for building privacy and accountability into organizational information management practices. The authors then provide an example of an organizational control process that uses the principles to implement the essential elements. Initially developed in the ’90s to advance privacy-enhancing information and communication technologies, Dr. Ann Cavoukian has since expanded the application of Privacy by Design principles to include business processes."

Specifically, it investigates (1) the extent to which these students start their courses both functionally competent in the use of IT and digitally literate, and (2) the relationship between students’ engagement with digital technologies and their experience of transition to postgraduate study in five areas: knowledge and skills, autonomy, ‘deeper’ learning, enculturation into an academic community, and self-concept.

Di Paolo \nTo say that artificial life is a young discipline in name only is to exaggerate, but it would be mistaken to think that its goals are new. The marriage of synthetic scientific aims with computational techniques makes artificial life a product of the last fifteen years, but its motivations have much deeper roots in cybernetics, theoretical biology, and the age-old drive to comprehend the mysteries of life and mind. Little wonder that a good part of the work in this field has been one of rediscovery and renewal of hard questions. Other disciplines have sidestepped such questions, often for very valid reasons, or have put them out of the focus of everyday research; yet these questions are particularly amenable to be treated with novel techniques such as computational modeling and other synthetic methodologies. What is an organism? What is cognition? Where do purposes come from? To rediscover and reinvent can be a pleasurable but difficult job. As historians of science know very well, concepts and methods evolve, disfavored theories get buried under successful ones (and not necessarily because they are any less valuable), metaphors and languages change, and social perception and pressures influence the directions of research. In view of this, how fortunate that an exceptional and multifaceted scientist like Francisco Varela has not only provided us with a rich legacy of ideas that, both in content and in perspective, are worthy of serious and active (re-)discovery and exploration, but has also himself been a predecessor and supporter of the field. Concrete examples of his work follow the methods of artificial life, both from when the label did not exist and from afterwards. We also have direct collaborators, many of whom are contributors to this special issue, who worry about many of the same problems as Varela did and whose work is directly connected to research lines in this field. Varela’s key scientific worry was the understanding of biological systems in their full autonomy—neither as a collection of inert components nor as something magical, but as introducing into the universe of physical interactions a special kind of novelty: an autonomously organized system with a formal identity and a point of view. This central worry led him in the 1970s to formulate, together with Humberto Maturana, the theory of autopoiesis, which radically alters the perspective on many biological phenomena by taking seriously (actually by founding itself on) the self-producing nature of bounded metabolic activity. The organism provides us with our primary biological unity, not only as an ontological foundation for biology but, more importantly, from an everyday pragmatic and scientific perspective. Dobzhansky’s famous motto could well be paraphrased as: “Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of the organism.” The obviousness in the new version is apparent, for understanding what makes an organism remains our problem and is what separates biology from physics. Following the principle of biological autonomy has allowed Varela to formulate radically novel theoretical proposals for key unsolved problems such as the origin of life, the artificial synthesis of minimal cells, the somatic ecology of the extra-cellular"

This loss of autonomy is accentuated with digital convergence, which integrates texts and images, the factories that produce them and the habitus of readers, spectators, and Internet users. This process gives rise to new conceptual and political challenges, such as the question of whether new televisual cultures can exist or the autonomy of media which are now resituated in an intermedia communication framework, or immersed in globalized or intercultural contexts."

Solitude in Cyberspace: the Individuality of an Author and the Autonomy of a Text \nhttps://doi.org/10.7592/methis.v6i8.552\n Virve Sarapik \n Piret Viires \nThe keywords in analyses of digital literature and cybertexts (literature that has been created by and is read on a computer) mostly derive from the vocabulary of increasing collectivism: shared authorship, readerviewer interaction, their active participation in creating text etc. However, this article focuses on the opposite phenomenon: the essence of individualism in the process of digital text creation, that is, solitude. At the same time, the paradoxes related to collectivism and solitude are also addressed. In this article, solitude is regarded as a technical term, indicating the number of different agents in a creative process. This primarily means: whether the text can be associated with one author and his intention, or whether authorship is distributed between several people who have participated in the creation of the text, as well as if and how much texts presume activity on the part of the reader. We can claim that when writers write their texts they are usually on their own. A text is born in the writer’s head and he or she needs some kind of form to present it. When the form of literature was mostly what was recorded on paper, we could say that the author formalised his text in solitude – writing alone on pieces of paper. Only after the manuscript was handed in were other participants added, such as the editor, designer and printer, who took part in the completion process of the literary work. However, when the end result of production is not a printed book, but a cyber- or hypertext, we can assume that these relationships change significantly in the case of digital literature. In addition to the author of the text, cybertexts and hypertexts need active co-authors: programmers, designers etc. Creating a cybertext is, therefore, basically a collective act (although there are of course exceptions). The author of a cybertext is no longer the only and unique creator. At the same time, the solitude of a creative work in cyberspace disappears. After publishing a book in print, the text is left alone; it begins living its own life. In cyberspace, on the contrary, connections in various forms between the author, the work and the reader are retained. Alan Kirby has launched the concept of digimodernism, which marks the cultural stage connected with the spread of Web 2.0. The “digimodernist turn”, in the form of blogs, Facebook and Twitter, has also brought about a change for authors of digital literature. The technological simplicity of the new software means that authors no longer need any urgent technical assistance. This again raises the problem of the author’s solitude: he formalises his work in his blog on his own, alone. It might thus seem paradoxical that in the printed world both the author and his work are solitary, whereas in the cyberworld the solitude of creative work vanishes, because it requires interaction between authors and readers. At the same time, the author’s solitude in cyberspace is twofold – creating cybertexts mostly requires assistance, whereas digimodernist blog literature can be produced in solitude, independently. Very few cybertexts in Estonia have been produced as teamwork, with technical assistance. In this article, two showcases have been studied: the hypertextual poem “Trepp” (“Staircase”, 1996) by Hasso Krull and the grand team project Sonetimasin (Sonnet Machine, 2000) by Mart Valjataga, which consists of a book, an Internet text generator and an enormous electromechanical sonnet machine, which was displayed in an art gallery. Considering the technological experimentation of Estonian writers, these two examples are exceptional rather than normal. Estonian authors have traditionally been reluctant to try out computer-technological experiments. However, the digimodernist turn has altered this situation. Many Estonian writers are active bloggers and Facebook users. Estonian writers who were earlier afraid of technology have become very keen on it in the digimodernist world. We think that the reason for this significant change is that Estonian writers wish to be independent. We can claim that Estonian writers want to be solitary in cyberspace, to avoid participating in technological teamwork, and the new and easy technological platforms make it possible. Literature in Estonia therefore, in a way, continues the tradition of the modernist author who does not wish to give up the position of being an individual author. Digimodernist technological simplicity has indeed made possible the organic transfer from printed text to digital literature, which does not endanger the authorial position."

This article deals with the use of EPRs among general practitioners in Britain. It examines two ways in which GPs use the EPR for accountability purposes. One way is to generate audit reports on the basis of the information that has been entered into the record. The other is to let the computer intervene in the clinical process through prompts. The article argues that GPs’ ambivalence toward using the EPR makes them active in finding ways that turn the EPR into a meaningful tool for them, that is, a tool that helps them provide what they see as good care. The article’s main contribution is to show how accountability and autonomy are coproduced; less professional autonomy does not follow from more requests to document one’s work. Instead, new forms of autonomy are produced in the sociotechnical network that is made up b…"

Although we found no improvement in the ability of the children to write sentences and only a marginal improvement in their ability to write for composition and effect, we did find a significant improvement in their ability to write about the ecology of an animal that they had encountered firsthand when compared to an animal that they had not encountered in life."

This study is based on a pre-service language teacher education programme in Patagonia, a southern Argentinian region with no face-to-face training offers, limited Internet access and a large number of unqualified teachers. Our goal is to broaden the understanding of online teacher education programmes at undergraduate level in contexts where most trainees are practicing teachers and where online education is the only possibility for holding a teaching qualification. We focused on the motivating factors that led 71 trainees to enrol and to remain in this online teacher training course. Through a mixed methods approach, the trainees completed an online survey ( n  = 71) and participated in a follow-up interview ( n  = 24). Results showed that obtaining a teaching degree, autonomy, and individual activities were key factors in initial and sustaining motivation. Participants’ experiences challenged collaborative learning in an online environment."

This paper explores one method for practicing anticipatory ethics in order to understand how a new infrastructure for the Internet might impact these social debates. This paper systematically examines values expressed by an Internet architecture engineering team-the Named Data Networking project-based on data gathered from publications and internal documents. Networking engineers making technical choices also weigh non-technical values when working on Internet infrastructure. Analysis of the team’s documents reveals both values invoked in response to technical constraints and possibilities, such as efficiency and dynamism, as well as values, including privacy, security and anonymity, which stem from a concern for personal liberties. More peripheral communitarian values espoused by the engineers include democratization and trust. The paper considers the contextual and social origins of these values, and then uses them as a method of practicing anticipatory ethics: considering the impact such priorities may have on a future Internet."

A sample of 418 persons with schizophrenia from 10 sites was used. The results of a final multiple regression analysis, explaining 52.3% of the variance, showed that five subjective factors were significantly associated with global subjective quality of life, together with one objective indicator, to have a close friend. No clinical characteristics were associated with global subjective quality of life. The largest part of the variance was explained by satisfaction with health, 36.3% of the variance, and self-esteem, 7.3% of the variance. It is concluded that the actual relationship between objective life conditions and subjectively experienced quality of life still remains unclear. Furthermore, it seems obvious that personality related factors such as self-esteem, mastery and sense of autonomy also play a role in the appraisal of subjective quality of life, which implies that factors like these are important to consider in clinical and social interventions for patients with schizophrenia in order to improve quality of life for these persons."

Drawing on 50 semi-structured interviews and some related email correspondence, the project investigates this cohort’s view of teachers’ professional autonomy. It takes as its starting point the hegemony of neoliberal policy and the adoption and reinforcement of this by UK political parties of all persuasions. The outcomes of the project demonstrate that notwithstanding the thrust of such policy -manifested most obviously by the current conversion of increasing numbers of schools to semi-privatised academy status -teachers acknowledge, explicitly or otherwise, the prevalence of performativity and survivalism yet often retain loyalty to the concept of education as a liberal humanist project as opposed to that of a provider of human capital. In short, they manage to cling to a notion of teaching that transcends the demands of the pursuit of measurable standards. They also recognize the central paradox of the current policy ensemble embodied in the inconsistency of rhetoric from government about professional autonomy alongside strong central control and scrutiny. The article goes on to ask whether, given the expressed antipathy on the part of this government and its predecessors towards research informed policy in general, and to qualitative research in particular, it is possible that such voices will be heeded by power. There are clear implications here for teacher education at initial and post-qualification"

Having finally shed the concerns related to the computer graphics medium, developers will concentrate on the message. Content will be key-no longer will users accept nonsensical, artistically vacant environments simply because they’re presented in a head-mounted display. This will also mean that static worlds, no matter how aesthetically pleasing, will come second to environments offering interactive content. The development and provision of dynamic content lie at the heart of the problem we face. For an environment to attract significant and regular participation, it must react in an intelligent and unpredictable fashion. Today, that intelligence can come from only two sources: live human collaboration and computer-generated autonomy. Collaborative VE research combines graphics, networking, human perception, and distributed computing issues. However, these facets betray a disappointing lack of coordination. Computer-generated autonomy (CGA) will certainly become inextricably melded with computer graphics. While this article focuses on other aspects of CVEs, the National Research Council’s report on Modeling and Simulation provides excellent recommendations for future avenues of research in CGA, such as behavior adaptability and human representation. Many of the infrastructure requirements for CGA-enhanced systems with a large number of synthetic actors are the same as those needed for large-scale CVEs."

Results showed youth in the three contexts were similar on romantic desire. Yet those in increasingly Westernized contexts reported more romantic activities and greater perceived autonomy from parents in partner choice. They were also more likely to consume Western and social media, and possess friends fostering permissive expectations, greater cross-sex network composition, and intimate communication. Involvement with the global media and friends explained the link between the cultural spectrum and romantic experiences. Implications of global restructuring on romantic experiences, media usage, and friendships are discussed, in consideration of gender."

Using an essay-based study of 258 youth (mean age 15.4 years, 56% female), we examined youth narratives concerning the effects of Internet anonymity on youth behavior online. Narratives were written anonymously to maximize disclosure. The needs categories of self-determination theory (SDT) for autonomy, relatedness, and competence were used to identify risks and opportunities in youth narratives. The analysis of the data was thematic, using both quantitative and qualitative methods with SDT providing an effective descriptive framework. Quantitative thematic analysis showed that 17% of the narratives included a notion of competence, 32% autonomy and 30% relatedness. Risks were also prevalent in the narratives, with primary themes of 74% cyberbullying and insults, 27% identity theft and risky false identity, and 18% sexual harassment or exploitation.

Parle avec Moi was based on a wiki platform (PBworks). The aims of the course were manifold: linguistic, metalinguistic (since conversational analysis was the main theoretical topic of the course), and methodological. The virtual context created using Web 2.0 tools helped the students consolidate and widen their active role and autonomy, fostering many of the key competences for lifelong learning outlined by the European Parliament and the Council framework (European Union, 2008), and above all, to develop their digital competence (2006/962/EC). In particular, students experimented with the three dimensions of the concept of digital competence outlined by Calvani et al . (2009) in their research project for assessing digital competence. Besides these introductory materials, which led to a certain savoir faire, to a sound understanding of the opportunities and potential risks of internet-based communication, students were successfully instructed in becoming ( savoir etre ) good builders of common knowledge in a wiki community."

What appears to be emerging is a contested space that has the potential to simultaneously enhance the power of organizations, whilst also acting as an enabling technology for the empowerment of grass-root networks. In this struggle, organizations are fighting for the retention of “old economy” positions, as well as the development of “new economy” power-bases. In realizing these positions, organizations and institutions are strategizing and manoeuvering in order to shape on-line networks and communications. For example, the on-line activities of individuals can be contained through various technological means, such as surveillance, and the structuring of the virtual world through the use of portals and “walled gardens”. However, loose groupings of individuals are also strategizing to ensure there is a liberation of their communication paths and practices, and to maintain the potential for mobilization within and across traditional boundaries. In this article, the unique nature and potential of the Internet are evaluated, and the struggle over this contested virtual space is explored."

Bruni \nIntroduction The Internet provides adolescents the chance to experience autonomy through the collection of information and contact with peers with whom to share experiences, emotions and thoughts. A misuse of the Internet can occur if a teenager avoids real relationships and surfing the web turns into a psychological defense, in contrast with a healthy mental development. Objectives and Aims The research investigates forms and motivations of misuse of the internet among a group of Italian teenagers. Objective of the work is the hypothesis of a correlation between massive use of internet and behaviours of social retreat. Methods The research used a questionnaire. The areas of investigation were: school performance, hours of internet surfing, activity on the Internet (social networks, games, information research, gambling online), psychological reasons of the Internet use, behaviours of social retreat. 583 adolescents (45% males and 54% females, mean age 17 years) responded to the questionnaire. Results The 6% of adolescents sample responded to always think the Internet even when not on the computer or gets irritated and reacts impulsively if someone bothers him while it is connected. The 5% prefer surfing rather then going out with friends. Hours of internet sulfing and responses of social retreat were correlated. Conclusions The social retreat can be one of consequences of the Internet misuse, with difficulties in socializing and use of the Internet as a psychological defense."

The investigation showed that, as a result of the possibilities both information technology and communication technology create to people, the evaluation process can not be limited to the logic of a post-procedural and definitive examination, it should rather be applied all time long, in all ways and for all activities and practices in a course environment. This approach has a multidimensional nature and is able to handle with the complexity of the related knowledge, taking into account many possibilities of interaction, different timing and spaces to learn and teach, the related interfaces as well as interdisciplinary approaches in the analyzed collaborative environment. The theoretical references have explored the evaluation concepts and its predominant practice, and examine several aspects of information and communication technology which apply to the education. Based on these two main fronts, other concepts have been considered in the theoretical field such as complexity, collaboration, time, space, interdisciplinary aspects, among others, which have allowed the research to have its basis on a framework of ideas from which the analysis have been brought to light in order to show the broad scope of the multidimensional learning evaluation in on-line collaborative environment, considering that such evaluation allows to set individual goals of students and teachers according to a pedagogical strategy that dialectically focuses the autonomy and the collective construction of knowledge. Another important point demonstrated in this investigation is that people are much more important than technologies, and that the collaboration between people is also important for an assessment of all moments, even considering the history of each participant as an individual who has a personal history and knowledge gathered from multiple sources and being continuously processed."

In 2006, Australia became the first country to criminalize such sites, sparking heated debate. Concerns were expressed that the law casts the criminal net too widely; inappropriately interferes with the autonomy of those who wish to die; and has jurisdictional limitations, with off-shore web sites remaining largely immune. Conversely, proponents point out that the law may limit access to domestic pro-suicide web sites, raise awareness of Internet-related suicide, mobilize community efforts to combat it, and serve as a powerful expression of societal norms about the promotion of suicidal behavior."

While in the early years of robotics our main focus of interest was restricted to designing robot sensors (and sensor-based man-machine interfaces) and closing smart sensory feedback loops, in recent years the activities have widened up considerably. Presently the general goal is the design of a new generation of multisensory light-weight robots for space applications which are operable by astronauts as well as from groundstations, based on powerful telerobotic concepts and man-machine interfaces. This goal is characterized by a high degree of interdisciplinarity and consists of a few major task areas, such as mechatronics (sensory and actuator developments), telerobotics (remote control concepts for space robots), and learning (and self-improvement). In the early years of our robotic activities cooperation with terrestrial industry was predominant, however the last five years were characterized by close cooperation and contracts with space industry. The space robot technology experiment ROTEX — Europe’s first active step into space robotics — was massively based on the concepts and systems developed here (multisensory gripper, local autonomy, telerobotic station); nevertheless in the future there will be considerable effort to transfer technology developed for space (e.g. light-weight concepts) back into terrestrial applications."

Moore’s (1972) theory of transactional distance was used to interpret the data. The results revealed that as university instructors in distance education programs gain experience, they find it is possible to translate many face-to-face instructional strategies to the online classroom and learn the technical aspects necessary for effective use of asynchronous text-based Internet communication tools. However, most instructors continue to experience a tension between structure, dialogue, and autonomy."

Grenz’s Templeton Lecture, “Why Do Theologians Need to Be Scientists?” published in the June 2000 issue of Zygon (Grenz 2000). In the first part I outline my reasons for finding the kind of theological reflections in which Grenz engages worthy of attention by noting my disagreement with the view that a sufficient response to theological issues can be formulated on the basis of an examination of our biological nature. I assert, in that connection, the autonomy of reason as a way of investigating and understanding the world. In the second part I respond directly to Grenz by explaining my disagreement with the postmodern critique of science upon which he relies and his adherence to Christian eschatology as an answer to the conundrums into which, he posits, we are drawn as a result of that critique. I note that I agree with Grenz, however, that the activity of valuing is necessarily a forward-looking Godlike endeavor that is not derivable from science. In the third part I suggest that we must be open to the investigation of the possible existence of an objective realm of value and that, in any case, rejection of the postmodern critique of science in many cases pro-vides a sound basis for the disciplined resolution of factual questions that frequently lie at the base of disagreements about values."

One option is through internet based learning or online learning. Internet has provided people with unlimited access to information. Online learning enables lifelong learning become more accessible. The development of online learning offer opportunities for teachers to create mentor online as to support student engagement in learning. Online learning provides multimedia and instructional information. Therefore e-mentoring becomes a viable tool to help student engage in online learning. By using electronic communications, e-mentoring intends to develop and grow the skills, knowledge, confidence, and cultural understanding of the lesser skilled individual. E-mentoring enables teachers interacting with students through email, online chat and online bulletin board regardless of geographic location. Consequently, learners are capable to build their own knowledge when they feel connected by the activity in which their engage. The purpose of this research is to investigate learner’s factor toward e mentoring. The study aims to identify learner’s attitudes toward e- mentoring. In fact understanding learner’s attitude toward e-mentoring is essential to ensure learners can reap the benefits of mentoring. A survey analysis was carried out. A total of 205 participants were asked to answer a questionnaire. A factor analysis and multiple regression technique were carried out. Factor analysis result indicated there are two groups of learner’s attitude that is learner autonomy and teacher as assisted tutors. Finding shows that learner’s attitudes play a role in predicting e-mentoring. To ascertain the successful of e-mentoring program, this research provide evidence learner’s attitude are critical factors to ensure students would stay involve with their mentor."

In this article, the authors argue that the affordances of RSS and content syndication can be used to deliver rich, active, social learning experiences that promote a high degree of learner personalisation, choice and autonomy. They describe a number of ways in which the potential of RSS can be exploited to transform pedagogy in ways that are congruent with emerging theories and models of learning, and that are consistent with the philosophy and ethos of Web 2.0 and networked society at large.

Information and communication technologies (ICT) hold great potential to significantly improve mental health outcomes for hard-to-reach and traditionally underserved groups. Internet-based programs and mobile phone applications may be particularly appealing to young men due to their convenience, accessibility and privacy and they also address the strong desire for independence and autonomy held by most men.

Given concerns that learning on these sites may happen at a surface level, we adopted self-determination theory for designing a social networking experience that aspired to offer a ‘community of inquiry’. A case study of a Mandarin class is reported, in which seven children voluntarily attended afterschool lessons and used a SNS for 12 weeks. Pedagogical strategies to create a sense of relatedness and competence and to offer autonomy support were used in order to steer their informal communication and exploration towards deep and meaningful learning.

Faisal \n Md. Niaz Morshed \nThe Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord, signed on December 2, 1997 between the government of Bangladesh and the Parbattya Chattagram Jana Samhiti Samiti(PCJSS—Chittagong Hill People’s Solidarity Association) ended a long-standing armed conflict between the Bangladesh Army and the tribal people of the Chittagong Hill Tracts in the south-eastern region of Bangladesh. The treaty promised to bring stability in the region. But 15 years into the signing of the Accord, it has yet to bear fruit. The region is still the most unstable region of the country and resentment among the tribal people is increasing day by day due to delays in the full implementation of the Accord. The Accord has also produced a new conflict: after its signing, a group emerged from within the PCJSS movement and formed the United People’s Democratic Front (UPDF) a political party aiming at “full autonomy” rather than implementation of the Accord. The frequent clashes between PCJSS and UPDF and between the tribal and the ‘Bengali Settlers’ pose serious threat to the security of the country. In this situation this paper argues that the government of Bangladesh should take immediate and meaningful steps toward full implementation for the Accord. The costs of failure are high: disrupting activities, armed warfare, violations of human rights, losses of lives and resources, exposing the border regions to external threats—all of these are costs that the nation can hardly bear if lasting peace is not achieved.

Once having achieved these goals, and with a conviction that the achieved must be defended and maintained by knowledge and education, the state authorities founded a seminary for education of priests and teachers capable to carry out national and spiritual reformation. The accord between the state and the Church regarding the strategic aims enabled the very first vocational school in Serbia to develop continuously its curricula and hire better and better teaching staff each year. However, due to the change of circumstances, the state passed the laws by which it enforced its dominance and showed a clear intent to subordinate theological education to its control. Yet, by its continuous activity during two crucial centuries, the Seminary became a part of collective consciousness, and its cadres contributed actively to the creation of original cultural and value patterns and preservation of national identity of the Serbian nation. The brilliant history of this school and its precious experience can be of great encouragement not only to the researchers of our pedagogical inheritance but also to all those who are engaged in reforming and adjusting education in Serbia to the European standards. ."

With age, the risk of frailty increases, including dementia and reduced mobility, and with it, functional dependence to perform activities of daily living. Ambient assisted living (AAL) aims at seamlessly integrating information and communication technologies (ICT) within homes and residences to increase the quality of life and autonomy of older adults. This special issue focuses on developments in AAL to address mobility challenges among frail older adults, due to physical and cognitive impairments. Among these challenges are an increase risk of falls, inability to independently perform daily activities and difficulties navigating the environment. Ambient technologies can assist automatically detecting falls or relevant activities performed by the older adult, providing augmented cues to assist in mobility and motivating older adults to remain active and autonomous. Ten papers have been selected to be included in this special issue. The first two papers deal directly with the problem of frailty and the risk of falls. The paper by Planinc and Kampel entitled ‘Introducing the use of path data for fall detection’ presents an approach based on a depth sensor to detect falls, which are becoming pervasive as their cost decreases. The approach is compared to the use of audio and 2D video exhibiting better performance. In ‘Elderly frailty detection by using accelerometerenabled smartphones and clinical information record’, Fontecha et al. describe the use of accelerometer data captured by a mobile phone for gait analysis and frailty estimation. The approach was evaluated with 15 elders, and they identified the strong and weak points of the approach to be used for the design of future systems. The next two papers are closely related with the former: an important aspect of AAL technologies aimed at assisting in activities of daily living is the recognition of the activity being performed by the user. In ‘Activity Recognition with Hand-worn Magnetic Sensors’, Maekawa et al. propose the use of magnetic sensors worn in the hand to detect the presence of electrical devices and infer the activity performed by the user. The evaluation performed with real data sets achieved high accuracies even with a small number of sensors. Bravo et al. present in ‘RFID breadcrumbs for enhanced care data management and dissemination’ an approach that uses RFID and NFC technologies to gather information in data-intensive working environments such as assisted living facilities. They introduce the RFID breadcurmbing interaction metaphor for efficient data management and dissemination. Once AAL systems are able to recognize the current activities of users, the task is now to help them in performing them. For this reason, one of the more active areas in ambient assisted living is the support for activities of daily living of the cognitive impaired. Two papers deal with this topic. People with Alzheimer’s have difficulties recognizing objects in their environment and navigating trough it. In ‘Augmented reality annotations to assist persons with Alzheimer’s and their caregivers’, Quintana and Favela describe the use of computer vision to create digital tags in J.

This paper fills this research gap through a questionnaire survey of 165 firms together with a number of interviews drawn from the Taiwan’s information and communication technology (ICT) industry. The results suggest that capabilities of exploring or exploiting technological opportunities, core technology capability, and autonomy of R&D decisions are particularly important to firm innovation in a highly competitive environment, whereas over commitments to existing technologies may constrain a firm’s innovation especially in such environment. Moreover, different types of competitive environment require different types of technological competencies to enhance firm innovativeness. This paper contributes to the existing theory by examining the joint effect of technology competency and competitive environment on a firm’s innovation."

The problem of pilotism in e-health and telemedicine is a growing concern, both in medical literature and among policy makers, who now ask for large-scale implementation of ICT in routine health service delivery. In this article, we turn the question of failing projects upside down. Instead of investigating the obstacles to implementing ICT and realising permanent changes in health care routines, we ask what makes the temporary ICT project survive, despite an apparent lack of success. Our empirical material is based on Norwegian telemedicine. Through a case study, we take an in-depth look into the history of one particular telemedical initiative and highlight how ICT projects matter on a managerial level. Our analysis reveals how management tasks were delegated to the ICT project, which thus contributed to four processes of organisational control: allocating resources, generating and managing enthusiasm, system correction and aligning local practice and national policies. We argue that the innovation project in itself can be considered an innovation that has become normalised in health care, not in clinical, but in management work. In everyday management, the ICT project appears to be a convenient tool suited to ease the tensions between state regulatory practices and claims of professional autonomy that arise in the wake of new public management reforms. Separating project management and funding from routine practice handles the conceptualised heterogeneity between innovation and routine within contemporary health care delivery. Whilst this separation eases the execution of both normal routines and innovative projects, it also delays expected diffusion of technology."

The rise of distributed work places and networked labour coincides with a privileging of individualised professional learning. Alongside this focus on the individual has been a growth in informal online learning communities and networks for professional learning and professional identity development. An example of these learning communities can be seen in the synchronous discussion events held on Twitter. This article examines a sample of these events where the interplay of personal learning and the collaborative components of professional learning and practice are seen, and discusses how facilitation is performed through a distributed assemblage of technologies and the collective of event participants. These Twitter based events demonstrate competing forces of newer technologies and related practices of social and collaborative learning against a rhetoric of learner autonomy and control found in the advocacy of the personalisation of learning."

Four dimensions of expressive individualism (autonomy, setting oneself apart from others, personal development, and the expression of emotions) and four types of prayer (petitionary, religious, meditative, and psychological) were distinguished. Data were collected from participants in internet forums on Christian religiosity (N = 158); they were asked to complete questionnaires about expressive individualism and prayer. The relationship between expressive individualism and prayer was found to be an ambivalent one, and one that is negatively dominated by autonomy. After eliminating the effect of autonomy, two patterns remain visible, both of them characterised by a positive connection to religiosity. Setting oneself apart from others is associated with petitionary and religious prayer; personal development with meditative and psych…"

    "text": "Doc 355 :  Governing and governance in education: Introduction \nhttps://doi.org/10.1177/0892020613493596\n Victoria Showunmi \nThe theme of this special edition is ‘Governing and Governance in Education’. The way the education system is governed is important for society. However, despite its importance, educational governance is substantially underresearched in comparison with other aspects of the management in educational settings. Furthermore, governing does not have the same profile as other aspects of management in education, such as the work of the headteacher or leadership in educational settings. Policy changes in train in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, such as the increased autonomy of educational institutions, reduced funding for schools and colleges, the continual emphasis on enhancing student attainment and achievement, and the emphasis on inter-organisational collaboration are likely to enhance the importance of governing and governance. In addition, new approaches to governing and governance are needed in order to engage with diversity and to encompass a range of styles from different societies and contexts. This issue is of particular importance to me and my own research interests (Showunmi, 2012). Equality and diversity inhabit difficult and sometimes sensitive territory, reflecting the difficulties and sensitivities inherent in society. In that sense they are an inevitable – and welcome – part of the wider education landscape. Surely a 21st century school, college or university, with values of collaboration, free speech and the expression of all views, is exactly the place to embrace these issues through good governing and appropriate governance. This special edition includes a range of very varied perspectives on aspects of governing and governance. Each of the author’s articles has significant things to say. The James, et al. article identifies features of the context for school governance generally in England and within each aspect reviews the constellation of current challenges confronting school governing bodies. This article is followed by a fascinating contribution from Poultney that is seeking to investigate how a small independent girls school has, over the last four years, shaped and defined its governing body to support a new headteacher and uphold its Moravian roots through a Board of Trustees who oversee and delegate governor responsibilities to the governing committee. The next article, written by Fitzgerald and Drake, draws on a study that investigated the responsibility of primary school governors in the financial management of schools in the UK and the way these responsibilities are discharged. Baxter and Wise, the authors of the next article, examine the ways in which being a member of a federation governing body impacts upon the governor identities. Using a case study based upon a single academy federation, the investigation employs a framework for identity analysis to analyse qualitative in-depth interviews with members within governing organizations in the federation. In the following paper, Hill and James report on the findings from a research study that sought to gain a greater understanding of the ways in which senior staff contribute to further education college governance. They analyse how senior staff experience their role and how they contribute to college governance. The final paper by Cutajar, et al. focuses on the history and background of the reforms to the Maltese education system and the way that governing has developed as part of those reforms. It argues that the reforms, which were intended to promote collaboration between schools, have missed an opportunity to bring about distributed governance. This special edition has come about through the BELMAS Governing and Governance Research Interest Group. If you have an interest in governing and governance in education and would like to find out more about the Group, please contact the convenor, Dr Ron Hill (ronandjennyhill@ btinternet.com). Finally, I would like to thank all the authors for their excellent contributions to what I consider to be an important and timely edition of the journal."

The main features of the original site geared towards the language learner were the creation of a virtual environment for tandem language learning and the provision of tools and data intended to help foster the development of learner autonomy. The new teacher interface supports the integration of tandem language learning activities in the foreign language classroom and addresses the difficult issue of performance assessment and task evaluation. Computer-mediated communication activities between students in different countries are notoriously difficult for teachers to monitor. Nevertheless, there is evidence that in certain situations it is beneficial for the teacher to be able to monitor these activities. The teacher interface of the ETR site offers a user-friendly interface which requires only basic computer skills, and gives teachers access to data such as the date of the most recently sent messages, the number of words sent by students and the percentages of text written by each student in their respective L1 and L2, without giving teachers access to the content of the messages, thus preserving students’ privacy. Furthermore, a slightly different version has also been designed for evaluation of the learning by the researcher investigating second language learning in an electronic tandem environment. This interface has been designed for setting up experiments and some of its features allow for control over variables related to the experiment. The interface records time stamps for sent and received messages."

Some expect that intelligent search agents could solve these problems. But most of these applications are not yet on the market, and the few that are: do they really perform? One of the few commercially available search agents is Autonomy, from Autonomy Corporation. Its concept is promising to professional users: the natural language processing of the query, the take‐over of repetitive jobs, an integrated interface for searching and managing information, and the sharing of knowledge with other users. The test in this article, however, reveals that the product is not yet ready to challenge the Internet search indexes which, in the test cases, perform better than Autonomy does with regard to recall and precision of information retrieval. Moreover, Autonomy does not give enough feedback to control the search action."

In order for NPs to be effectively used, barriers to independent practice must be eliminated.

The concept of informal learning is presented and related to current areas of interest in the literature such as incidental learning, and dynamic systems theory. Our research investigates how non-specialist language learners use the Internet in their spare time to read and listen to English, and also communicate in English, notably in online communities through social networking websites. The study looks particularly at the dynamics of these phenomena by studying a small number of non-native users of English over a period of two months. The results of this research will be used to question the relevance of the learner autonomy paradigm, which has been a cornerstone of language learning policy in Europe for the past thirty years."

This paper explores the potential of cultural-historical activity theory to study this relationship. Starting from the complex and multidimensional nature of learner autonomy, it highlights some of the weaknesses in the CALL literature addressing some aspects of this relationship. Following a presentation of the main tenets of cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT), including the notion of contradiction which is at the core of CHAT, it then seeks to demonstrate how activity theory can assist us in rethinking our understanding of learner autonomy in the context of technology-rich language learning environments and in formulating suitable criteria and questions, which can guide judgemental and empirical analyses. The paper concludes by illustrating some of the principles explored through examples drawn from an activity-theoretical judgemental analysis of a French module delivered to first year students in Dublin City University."

These individual creators are increasingly harnessing copyright law to insist on ownership of the rights to control their musical works, scholarly research, and even Facebook musings.When individual creators claim, retain, and manage their own copyrights, they exercise a degree of authorial autonomy that befits the Internet Age. But they simultaneously contribute to a troubling phenomenon I call “copyright atomism” - the proliferation, distribution, and fragmentation of the exclusive rights bestowed by copyright law. An atomistic copyright system is crowded with protected works and rights, owned by rights-holders who are numerous and far-flung. This situation can raise information and transaction costs for participants in the creative marketplace, hampering future generations of creativity and thus undermining the very purpose of copyright: to encourage the creation and dissemination of works of authorship for the ultimate benefit of the public.This article introduces and articulates the copyright atomism concept. It then places atomism in historical and doctrinal context by documenting copyright law’s encounters with proliferated, distributed, and fragmented copyright ownership from medieval monasteries to the Internet age. This history demonstrates the enduring relevance of anxiety about atomism within copyright policy, highlights countervailing concerns, and provides a framework for thinking about how to alleviate the unfortunate contemporary consequences of atomism - and how not to."

It also investigated the platform problems and teachers’ main concerns towards integrating these tools. Accordingly, 263 EFL teachers who were randomly selected from different institutes in three Iranian provinces were asked to answer the researchers-made questionnaire. The results revealed that EFL teachers 1) are highly familiar with most of the internet tools; 2) have highly positive attitudes towards using and integrating internet tools in their classrooms; 3) are willing to use these technologies for developing certain language skills competency; and 4) are highly concerned about culturally inappropriate materials and students’ internet dependability and autonomy. Furthermore, it was found that the results were affected by variables such as teachers’ age and educational degree. Finally, it was concluded that in spite of the EFL teachers’ positive attitudes and willingness towards these tools, still they are facing some challenging concerns about the application of the given tools due to some cultural and platform problems.

It shows how the design process is facilitated by autonomy, how autonomy is enhanced through the design process and how the emergence of anticipatory and future‐oriented representational content in an autonomous cognitive system provides the functionality needed for the strengthening of both its autonomy and the design process, in which the autonomous cognitive system purposefully engages.Design/methodology/approach – Initially, the essential characteristics of the design process and of the cognitive systems participating in it will be identified. Then, an attempt to demonstrate the ability of an enhanced second‐order cybernetic framework to satisfy these characteristics will be made. Next, an analytic description of the design process under this framework is presented and the respective implications are critically discussed.Findings – The role of autonomy is crucial for the design process, as it seems that a…"

Ninety-two interviews were conducted with midwives, coordinators, doctors, and village representatives. This study applies a dialectical perspective to supplement the analytical frame of the ICT for healthcare development model (Chib et al., 2008), by addressing the multi-dimensionality of benefits and barriers. The theory of dialectical tension (Baxter and Montgomery, 1996) situates the conceptual discussion around the struggles between autonomy and subordination within gender roles, personal growth versus technological competency, and issues of economic and resource control in traditional hierarchies. We find that midwives engage in legitimization strategies, develop peer support, and focus on strategic issues to develop the capacity for agency and autonomy, despite socio-organizational barriers.

Social media is integrated in schools and higher learning institutions for communication and reflection of learning which enhance teachers’ performance in leadership quality and effective teaching. This study was designed in a qualitative approach mainly to explore the extent of interest and enjoyment students experienced during an intensive ICT course. Blog was used as a medium for reflection during the class where students posted their creations of videos, posters and other ICT materials. The three needs investigated were namely autonomy, competence, and relatedness support. The researcher further examined on students’ awareness of the usefulness of the ICT skill they learned and how much they can use the blog for teaching and learning. Based on the Basic Psychological Needs Theory framework (BPNT), this study has adopted the direct observation, journal entry, and interviews as a triangulation approach."

Singh \nOpen environments such as the Internet— and even corporate intranets— enable a large number of interested parties to use and enhance vast quantities of information. These environments support modern applications, such as manufacturing, virtual enterprises, and ubiquitous information access, which involve a number of information sources and component activities. However, without principled techniques to coordinate the various activities, any solutions would yield disjointed and error-prone behavior, while consuming excessive effort to build and maintain. The agent metaphor, long in study in artificial intelligence, has recently become popular in mainstream computing, largely due to its suitability for open environments. Agents can be thought of as active objects with some special properties tailored to open environments. For our purposes, the key aspects of agents are their autonomy and abilities to perceive, reason, and act in their environment, as well as to socially interact and communicate with other agents [7]. When agents interact with one another they form a multiagent system. As part of a multiagent system, agents can capture and apply the semantic constraints among heterogeneous components in order to enact distributed workflows. Autonomy is critical in open environments. Consider a manufacturing scenario requiring supply-chain coordination. It is natural to model independent companies in a supply chain as represented by autonomous agents. But, at first sight, autonomy is a mixed blessing if the companies behaved arbitrarily, the supply chain would break. Consequently, our main technical challenge is to manage autonomy that is, how to maximize freedom without letting it devolve into chaos. We propose that the main basis for managing autonomy lies in the notion of commitments. A flexible formulation of commitments can provide a natural means through which autonomous agents may voluntarily constrain their behavior. By flexible, we mean that it should be possible to cancel or otherwise modify the commitments. Consider a situation where a purchaser is trying to obtain some parts from a vendor. We would like the vendor to commit to delivering the parts of the right quality to the purchaser. However, it is important that the supply chain be able to survive exceptions such as when the manufacturing plant goes down in an earthquake, or when the purchaser decides that it needs the parts to be of a lower error tolerance than initially ordered. Information cannot be understood independently of the processes that create or consume it. The desired flexibility of behavior and the ability to recover from failures require an approach that is sensitive to how those processes interact. We show that when agents are associated with each independent process, our flexible notion of commitments can capture the desired interactions among those processes"

Firdaus M. Sharifuddin \nIn this paper, we present the concept of a node which consists of a human actor, one or more agents, and their combined functions to represent a collective intelligent entity. Basically, the instantiation of nodes with diverse pre-defined functions in a workflow process could represent a domain in which humans interact with other humans via software agents in a collaborative environment to achieve some common goal. Here, the agents‟ functions supplement the demands of the corresponding human‟s pre-defined functions. As a part of this research, a survey is conducted to determine generalized functions of humans and agents in a node. The aim is to solicit information pertaining to humans‟ daily tasks and the kind of assistance they would prefer to have to ease those tasks. The tasks entail communicating with people, using several devices and/or media such as Document, Email, Phone, and SMS. This paper proposes a Nodal Approach (NA) to simplified modeling of humans and software agents with their predefined functions for collaboration. An example user application is developed and tested involving several academician functions assisted by their corresponding software agents.

Serious gaming interfaces provide opportunities to optimize user adherence and impact. Health interventions based in theory and evidence and tailored to psychological constructs have been found to be more effective to promote behavior change. Defining the design elements which engage users and help them to meet their goals can contribute to better informed serious games. Objective: To elucidate design elements important in SPARX, a serious game for adolescents with depression, from a user-centered perspective. Methods: We proposed a model based on an established theory of health behavior change and practical features of serious game design to organize ideas and rationale. We analyzed data from 5 studies comprising a total of 22 focus groups and 66 semistructured interviews conducted with youth and families in New Zealand and Australia who had viewed or used SPARX. User perceptions of the game were applied to this framework. Results: A coherent framework was established using the three constructs of self-determination theory (SDT), autonomy, competence, and relatedness, to organize user perceptions and design elements within four areas important in design: computer game, accessibility, working alliance, and learning in immersion. User perceptions mapped well to the framework, which may assist developers in understanding the context of user needs. By mapping these elements against the constructs of SDT, we were able to propose a sound theoretical base for the model. Conclusions: This study’s method allowed for the articulation of design elements in a serious game from a user-centered perspective within a coherent overarching framework. The framework can be used to deliberately incorporate serious game design elements that support a user’s sense of autonomy, competence, and relatedness, key constructs which have been found to mediate motivation at all stages of the change process. The resulting model introduces promising avenues for future exploration. Involving users in program design remains an imperative if serious games are to be fit for purpose."

This article suggests an avenue to empower women in the North and South (who already have Internet access) by building virtual international communities as one of the tools for women to participate in and benefit from international exchange. It describes the social and technical aspects of building an enabling environment for women called the Virtual International Womens University (vifu). A development procedure characterized by inclusion participation user-developer-interaction and transparency with the aim of enabling sociability and the transfer of technological know-how is discussed.

Accordingly, they have implemented various forms of top-down monitoring, in which an authority controls employees’ online behavior. The efficacy of this “vertical” control system, however, is less clear than its unintended consequence: demotivated employees. Drawing from research on self-determination and control systems, the current research examined whether two “horizontal” control systems—peer monitoring and peer communication—would mitigate internet abuse with fewer motivational consequences. Using a new virtual environment and a survey, three studies compared the systems’ objective and subjective effects, documenting an underlying psychological mechanism: autonomy. Consistent with predictions, the results suggested that both horizontal systems can reduce abuse as readily as the vertical system, but they exact fewer motivational costs by supporting a…"

Methods: The sample of 237 (75% women) first year university students completed questionnaires on generalized problematic internet use (GPIU), perceived stress (PS) and BPN (autonomy, competence, relatedness) on two occasions over a one year period. Linear regression models were built to explore the relationship between PS, BPN and GPIU as well as to test the potential moderating role of BPN. Findings: The BPN relatedness at T2 was negatively associated with GPIU (?=-0.156; p?0.05). Further, PS at the baseline and its increase during the year served as significant predictors of GPIU at T2 (?=0.310 p?0.001; ?=0.153 p?0.05). However, evidence for the moderating effect of BSN was not detected. Discussion: In line with the assumptions, PS and low satisfaction with relationships was found to be directly related to GPIU although further research is needed to identify moderating protective factors."

The study first analyses the diverse components of the instructional approach and the extent to which this approach interrelates with technologies within the context of what we have defined as a holistic experience, since it also aims to develop a set of generic competences or transferable skills. Second, an example of a course project framed in this holistic approach is described in order to exemplify the specific actions suggested for learner autonomy and CLIL. The approach provides both an adequate framework as well as the conditions needed to carry out a lifelong learning experience within our context, a Spanish School of Engineering. In addition to specialized language and content, the approach integrates the learning of skills and capacities required by the new plans that have been established following the Bologna Declaration in 1999."

In 2002, “Medical Professionalism in the New Millennium: A Physician Charter” was published in the Annals of Internal Medicine and elsewhere (1). This document stressed the primacy of patient welfare, patient autonomy, and social justice. The charter is discussed in Dr. Kirk’s excellent Kitchens Lecture given at Baylor University Medical Center (2). Dr. Lloyd Kitchens was an exemplary clinician who personified the finest qualities of a physician. His article on medical etiquette published in these Proceedings several years ago still rings true (3).\nWhat role does professionalism have in the current medical arena? Certainly patient welfare, autonomy, and social justice are core principles. Paradoxically, the challenges of delivering health care are becoming ever greater at the same time that scientific medicine is advancing as never before. How can we provide appropriate care for our patients in a universal, comprehensive, and equitable manner (4–6)? How can medicine fulfill its social contract with society?\nWilliam Osler, the great clinician and educator who lived between 1849 and 1919, represents one exemplar of medicine as a noble profession and a calling (7, 8). His many aphorisms and essays speak eloquently to the heart of the doctor-patient relationship. His observation that “the old art can not possibly be replaced by, but must be incorporated in, the new science” is as true today as it was 100 years ago (9). Osler welcomed scientific advances in medicine because he knew they would enable him to take better care of his patients. He was at the forefront of medical science and no doubt would still be if he were alive today. In addition to his focus on science, he emphasized that doctors should pay special attention to the patient, not just the disease. His friendliness, generosity, and respect for others have had an enduring influence on generations of students and physicians. In an essay entitled “The Reserves of Life” he likened a medical career to a race through London and told students at St. Mary’s Hospital Medical School that “in ordinary training you run the course over, but life’s race is run but once; and, though the course may seem long to you, it really is very short, but very hard to learn. Fortunately, you are not alone on the track, as your brothers are ahead, and if you are willing there is always help at hand” (9). We should heed this counsel. Guidance from trusted colleagues is a valuable but sometimes underutilized asset. Many of William Osler’s precepts remain applicable today.\nPerhaps the central pillar of professionalism is competence (6, 10, 11). Unless a physician is competent, he or she cannot be either professional or ethical. Kindness and compassion are other qualities which, though not mentioned in the physician charter, are fundamental to the care of ill people. Patients are cared for individually; whether in an office, clinic, hospital, or on a battlefield, the doctor-patient relationship is a one-on-one encounter. A physician must obtain a history, elicit pertinent positive and negative physical findings, and order selected laboratory tests. He or she must analyze these data in the context of an ever-expanding galaxy of scientific knowledge. What is the diagnosis? What constitutes the best treatment for this patient? What can be done to return this individual to as close to normal daily activities for him or her as possible? The answers to these challenging questions are sought every time a doctor sees a patient (7). In our current competitive and costly environment, finding these answers becomes daunting. We need help in responding appropriately and effectively (12, 13). This is our responsibility, and we must be accountable.\nSo who is a true professional? Dr. Michael LaCombe describes a physician who represents the consummate example:\nI knew a doctor once who was honest, but gentle with his honesty, and was loving, but careful with his love, who was disciplined without being rigid, and right without the stain of arrogance, who was self-questioning without self-doubt, introspective and reflective and in the same moment, decisive, who was strong, hard, adamant, but all these things laced with tenderness and understanding, a doctor who worshipped his calling without worshipping himself, who was busy beyond belief, but who had time—time to smile, to chat, to touch the shoulder and take the hand, and who had time enough for Death as well as Life (14).\nProfessionalism and being professional are core competencies now adopted by accredited residency and fellowship training programs. Their impact extends far beyond training, however. Dr. Kirk’s fine address and the wisdom of role models such as William Osler, Lloyd Kitchens, and Michael LaCombe will help us follow the right path (15)."

    "text": "Doc 375 :  Using Contradictions to Ravel Teaching and Learning Challenges in a Blended Is Course in an African University \nhttps://doi.org/10.28945/1324\n Patient Rambe \nIntroduction As university student interaction and sharing of electronic resources in Web-enabled environments are becoming an embedded practice (Ng’ambi & Rambe, 2008), educators are under pressure to evolve pedagogical approaches (Salmon, 2007) that could support and leverage these forms of interactions. However, educators’ implementation of Web-enabled courses for first year university students is often constrained by varying student academic underpreparedness, large classes, and inadequate curriculum design (Jaffer, Ng’ambi, & Czerniewicz, 2007) and student incapacity to learn when confronted with a learning environment that requires an unfamiliar degree of initiative and autonomy (Tan & Chan, 1997). The latter is the case for Social Media-enhanced learning environments that often put additional cognitive demands on learners to generate, share, and meaningfully engage with Web content, notwithstanding their underdeveloped self-regulation and learning abilities. Social Media denotes an aggregate of Web 2.0 based tools, applications, business models, and social networking that allows people to collaborate in novel ways at a large scale (Leadbeater, 2007). Instances of Social Media encapsulate social networking sites, blogs, podcasts, multimedia sharing sites, and aggregation tools. Pargetter et al. (1998) suggest that students consistently identify independent learning and self-iscipline as basic goals of their university education, although many are unsure about how to achieve those goals. In Social Media where there is limited lecturer-student direct interaction, not only are students challenged by using social networking applications for meaningful learning, but rather how self-directed learning can be fostered in these quasi-formal learning spaces. As Dabbagh and Kitsantas (2005) suggest, in Web-based learning environments, the physical absence of the instructor and the increased responsibility demanded of learners to effectively engage with learning tasks may present difficulties for learners, particularly those with low self-regulatory skills. The challenge, therefore, is grasping how Social Media like Facebook could impact student conceptual and practical understanding of Information Systems (IS) if it was appropriated for teaching and learning. Mindful of the uptake of these technologies in South African universities for sharing academic information, responding to student queries and building trust among academic communities (Moore, 2010), exploring the implications of implementing them in university is essential to effective pedagogical delivery. The South African government expects Information Systems (IS) education to produce technically competent graduates who not only know how to effectively apply Web-based technology for their lifelong learning, but also understand how to appropriate it to solve complex work-elated problems. Emphasising the social relevance of higher education training to nation development, the South African White Paper on Higher Education (Republic of South Africa, 1997) reiterates the need to develop professionals and knowledge workers with globally equivalent skills and who are conscious of their role in contributing to national development. As Shen, Lee, and Tsai (2007) comment, a vocational education system constantly involves meeting the needs and the new demand for highly skilled manpower, the continued progress of modern technology, the worldwide economic development, and the changing industrial structure. The above points out the central role that technological skills play in the structural dynamics of national development in addition to psychological development. The challenge however for IS practitioners is designing learning environments that afford the acquisition and development of sophisticated IS skills and respond to the learning needs of university learners. Graetz (2006) argues that the migration of content which lecturers traditionally delivered in lecture format to the Web is helping shift the function served by brick and mortar classrooms from information delivery to collaboration and discussion. …"

In this paper, I claim that parents ought not to follow this advice, because to do so would violate children’s right to privacy over their on-line information exchanges. In defense of this claim, I argue that children have a right to privacy from their parents, because such a right respects their current capacities and fosters their future capacities for autonomy and relationships."

Based on an online-survey (N = 230), this study tested the effects of intrinsic need satisfaction and perceived social pressure on the enjoyment of Facebook use with structural equation modeling. The results reveal complex effects of extrinsic motivation: While social pressure negatively affected autonomy need satisfaction, it was positively related to competence and relatedness need satisfaction.

The study involves 16 American undergraduate students who participated in blogs to develop their intercultural competence over the course of one-semester study abroad. The results show that blogs afforded students the opportunity to work independently (e.g., content creation) and reflect upon cross-cultural issues. Critical reflection, however, relied on the teacher’s guidance and feedback, as most of the students were cognitively challenged by not being able to clearly articulate different points of view. It is likely that students were not accustomed to reflecting. The findings also indicate that task type fostered autonomy in different ways. While free topics gave students more control of their own learning, teacher-assigned topics required them to critically think about the readings. Lack of access to Internet at the host institution and family also contributed to a limited level of social interaction. The study concludes that well-designed tasks, effective metacognitive and cognitive skills, and the accessibility to Internet are essential to maximize the potentials of blogs for learner autonomy and intercultural communication."

ICMC can be expected to evolve into the mainstream of existing communications infrastructure, but this evolution is not occurring uniformly across organizations. ICMC infrastructure appears to be most strongly supported, at least in this early stage, among organizations dependent on the maintenance of external weak social ties among employees who are members of professional, dispersed occupational communities. This can be seen in the experience of research-oriented organizations. Two strong forces—the professionalism of key occupational communities seeking autonomy, and a persistent desire by organizations to reduce fixed costs and organizational size—are posited as encouraging growth of ICMC infrastructure. Such growth might provide an important “bootstrapping mechanism” of long-predicted shifts from hierarchical to market forms of organization, at least in professionalized sectors of the economy."

More recently still, a number of universities have published policy or guidance documents on the use of social media for a range of universityrelated purposes including learning, teaching and assessment. This study considers the social media policies of 14 universities in the United Kingdom (UK) that are currently in the public domain. It addresses some of the ways in which Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are responding to both the positive potential of social media as well as its perceived threats. Drawing inspiration, if not actual method, from critical discourse analysis, this study argues that marketisation has been the main policy driver with many social media policies being developed to promote university ‘‘brands’’ as well as protect institutional reputation. The creation and implementation of social media policies are therefore playing a role in helping universities manage both the risks and the benefits of social media in the context of an increasingly marketised Higher Education (HE) environment in which protecting institutional reputation has become a priority. However, in the defence of the metaphorical institutional ‘‘share price’’, some policies constrain both academic autonomy and the possibilities for innovation and risk-taking.

The term EBM first appeared in the biomedical literature in 1991 in an article written by a prominent member of this group-Gordon Guyatt from McMaster University. The inventors of EBM have also created the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) working group, which is a prominent international organisation whose main purpose is to develop evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). CPGs that are based on the GRADE approach are becoming increasingly adopted worldwide, in particular by many professional or governmental organisations. This group of thinkers being thus identified, we have retrieved and read many of their publications in order to try and understand how they intend to incorporate bioethical values into their concept. The author of this little essay did also spend a few years on the internet as an active member of the GRADE group discussion list. The observations thus gathered suggest that although some of the inventors of EBM, at least Gordon Guyatt, wish to incorporate core principles of biomedical ethics into their concept (ie, non-malevolence, beneficence and maybe to a lesser extent respect for autonomy, and justice), some clarifications are still necessary in order to better understand how they intend to more explicitly incorporate bioethical values into their concept and, perhaps more importantly, into evidence-based CPGs."

Definitions have traditionally emphasised respect for autonomy and the right to self-determination of the individual. However, the meaning of informed consent and the values on which it is based are grounded in society and the practicalities of social relationships. As society changes, so too do the meaning and practice of informed consent. In this paper, we trace the ways in which the meaning and practice of informed consent has changed over the last 35 years with reference to four qualitative studies of parenting and children in the UK which we have undertaken at different points in our research careers. We focus in particular on the shifting boundaries between the professional and personal, and changing expressions of agency and power in a context of heightened perceptions of risk in everyday life. We also discuss developments in information and communication technologies as a factor in changing both the formal requirements for and the situated practicalities of obtaining informed consent. We conclude by considering the implications for informed consent of both increasing bureaucratic regulation and increasingly sophisticated information and communication technologies and suggest strategies for rethinking and managing ‘consent’ in qualitative research practice."

Background: The US Task Force on Organ Transplantation recommended that considerations of justice, autonomy and medical outcome be part of all organ allocation decisions. Justice in this context may be modeled as a function of three types of need, related to age, clinical urgency, and quality of life. Methods: A web-based survey was conducted in which respondents were asked to choose between two hypothetical patients who differed in clinical urgency (time to death Results: A pool of 1600 people were notified via email about the survey; 623 (39%) responded.

Guidelines are needed to ensure ethical conduct. In this article, the authors examine how a youth-focused research program negotiated ethical practices in the creation of its comprehensive health site and online message board. They address three situations in which ethical predicaments arose: (a) enrolling research participants, (b) protecting participants from risk or harm, and (c) linking public and private data. Drawing on the ethical principles of autonomy, nonmaleficence, justice, and beneficence, the authors present practical guidelines for resolving ethical dilemmas in research on Internet communities."

Individuals cannot be treated as objects, or be instructed how to take part in an experiment, without the recognition of the autonomy of each person and the invitation to participate jointly in co-operative exploration of the nature of man. An individual can be seen as a personal scientist who forms theories about the world and tests these theories against his personal experience of reality, adapting his theories for a more effective anticipation of events and hence a more competent interaction with his environment. A suite of computer programs (PEGASUS, FOCUS, MINUS, CORE, ARGUS and SOCIOGRIDS) has been developed, each one acting as a cybernetic tool to enhance man’s capabilities to understand both himself and his relationships with other perspectives of the world. PEGASUS is described, including PEGASUS-BANK which can be used to explore the relationship of an individual with another individual (or group). The CORE program can be used to chart change in a person over time, and to find the level of understanding and agreement between two people. Shared understanding within small groups can be investigated using the SOCIOGRIDS program which produces a mapping of the intra-group relationships, and the subject content which shows the extent of agreement in the group. A study involving the exchange of subjective standards in human judgement is briefly described, and an analogy drawn to the understanding of different perspectives in the treatment of a medical or clinical patient."

While some theorists celebrate possibilities for autonomy, others are concerned that the increased reliance on mobile-based communication leads to disparities in digital skill and status replication. We examined how mobile-mediated behavior among teens interacted with the characteristics of socio-demographics and mobile access to predict (1) levels of diverse use and skill and (2) consequences of skill/use differences ( n = 552). Findings revealed that skill/use disparities were manifested based on race, and such variations were associated with status of parents in interaction with mobile phone ownership. Instrumental use and content/creation-based skill had significant impacts on public involvement among teens. Our data have implications for understanding how social backgrounds incubate mobile-based disparities in light of enabling teens’ life chances."

In fact, tendencies for bureaucratization of human relations in the workplace are the result of externalized interpersonal defense mechanisms to avoid personalization of the workplace and face-a-face interactions. Self-systems are learned defensive activities against anxiety and fear caused by the loss of security of self-esteem. A threatening (potentially anxiety ridden) environment, perceived by the person or group of people, will activate security operations of self-systems, resulting in some distortion of reality and cognition. The psychoanalysis of organizations highlights the frequently paradoxical behavior of managers and workers. We conceptualize paradox as the simultaneous existence in the organization of two inconsistent states, such as empowerment and conformance: old and new. We show that in the organizational context, there are the intended consequences of the action, which are directed toward improving performance and profit. On the other hand, there are the unintended consequences of the same action, which may actually undermine performance, profit and cancel out the intended positive consequences. In our case study, we analyze the paradox produced by the implementation of an Internet Security System at a Brazilian High Tech Company. We exemplify a paradox between the dimensions bureaucratic control X autonomy. This paradox increased the organization´ stress level and social actors self defense mechanisms. We will describe and analyze some of de unintended consequences produced by social actors self defense mechanisms and resistance-to-change phenomenon in this case.

EI software architectures, or frameworks, are often built on top of standard middleware and typically lack the ability to function in dynamic environments where flexibility, adaptability, and knowledge management are crucial. Furthermore, they do not scale well to wide-area enterprises that extend across organizational boundaries. These frameworks nevertheless offer a cost-effective basis for resource management, user coordination, knowledge exchange, and information extraction in a virtual enterprise. The paper considers how, by incorporating agents with their inherently distributed characteristics of autonomy, reasoning or intelligence, and goal-driven behavior, existing EI frameworks can be enhanced to support adaptive virtual enterprises."

This opens many new possibilities, opportunities, and challenges in electronic trading. Electronic trading lowers cost of trading and improves trading efficiency. Marketplaces typically consist of autonomous parties that interact with each other in several ways. Examples are product advising, sales negotiation, information providing, etc. In daily life, the number of parties and products is limited, due to space and time constraints. In E-trading, such constraints do not need to exist, and a wide variety of suppliers, products, and clients become readily available. Agent technology can enhance electronic market places by using the autonomy and flexibility features of the software agents: a software agent is a piece of software that is autonomous, and that is owned by some party. In this paper we review the uses of agent technology in Electronic trading. The agent technology offers following advantages:servicecustomization, adaptability and supports Component Based Software Engineering (CBSE)."

Review boards provide an independent assessment of research proposals. This additional level of scrutiny is meant to provide an additional level of protection for human subjects. However, oversight of human subject research, as currently carried out in the bureaucratic, rule‐based, clinically‐biased American system, is too cumbersome with regard to online research. In addition, it is not conducive to the training of ethical Internet researchers. Internet research differs from traditional human subject research in many ways, and the oversight rules governing traditional research do not easily relate to the complexities of conducting research online. Online researchers do not oppose the foundational principles of non‐maleficence (avoiding harm) and autonomy, nor do they reject the ideals of informed consent and confidentiality, nevertheless, they face practical dilemmas in attempting to follow these principles and apply these ideals in the various Internet domains. The current oversight system is ill‐equipped to assist. A conservative response to this problem of fit might entail adjustments to the oversight system that, in the case of the American system, would entail modifications to the Common Rule and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs). I will argue in this paper, instead, that re‐structuring is needed to allow more oversight authority for Internet researchers. I will utilize Consequentialism and Virtue Ethics in making this case."

Activities, jobs, skills, cultures, needs etc. have been impressed and transformed by this technology. Undoubtedly, entrepreneurship has a major role in the development of these technologies; however, these technologies also influence the entrepreneurship and in other words, have created a modern entrepreneurship. In this regard, information and communications are two basic required tools for every entrepreneurial activity. Today, information technology has spread widely in the community and has integrated into all aspects of life. Entrepreneurship is the process of creating something new by spending a lot of time and effort and accepting financial, emotional and social risks to gain financial resources, job satisfaction and autonomy. In fact, information technology is considered as the driving force by which, in addition to mobilizing the job and employment wheels, leads to the economic growth and dynamics of community and the creation of a new kind of economy, that is called knowledge-based economy. This article has tried to analyze the concepts of information and communication technology and entrepreneurship and also has considered the interaction of information technology and entrepreneurship.

Based on interviews and participant-observation in New York City, we trace how entrepreneurial labor becomes intertwined with work identities in cultural industries both on and off the job. While workers are drawn to the autonomy, creativity and excitement that jobs in these media industries can provide, they have also come to accept as normal the high risks associated with this work. Diffused through media images, this normalization of risk serves as a model for how workers in other industries should behave under flexible employment conditions. Using interview data from within the fashion media and the dot-com world, we discuss eight forces that give rise to the phenomenon of entrepreneurial labor: the cultural quality of cool, creativity, autonomy, self-investment, comp…"

To do this, we carried out a survey study based on a purposely designed questionnaire answered by 478 women from rural areas of Andalusia aged 18 to 65. From an analysis of the responses, we identified two profiles based on the use motives of social networking sites. The results indicate that women, who use social networks with a higher diversity of uses, also express higher level of intensity, ability and autonomy of use. In contrast, women who use only social networks with a relational purpose, also express lower level of intensity, ability and autonomy in the use of social networks. These findings suggest that use motives is a predictor variable of rural women’s digital inclusion in the social networks. The findings allow us to rethink the educational proposals of digital literacy."

This paper considers the use of social media platform Padlet as an alternative educational interface through evaluation of an intervention-based case-study. Focus groups were conducted with the student cohort, identifying a number of recurring themes that form the main body of this paper: visuality and clarity of the interface, autonomy over learning, students as co-producers and critical reflection. These themes address the intervention itself, and acknowledge the limitations of the research by proposing potential developments. The paper concludes by drawing together questions for further research, and notably reflects on whether it is more pertinent to address the way we use educational interfaces, rather than the interfaces themselves, in considering ‘the way forward’ for blended learning in Higher Education 2018."

In the development, the major difficulties included sensing human behaviors, conversation in a noisy daily environment, and the needs of unexpected miscellaneous knowledge in the conversation. We chose a network-robot system approach, where a single robot’s poor sensing capability and knowledge are supplemented by ubiquitous sensors and a human operator. The developed robot system detects a person with floor sensors to initiate interaction, identifies individuals with radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, gives shopping information while chatting, and provides route guidance with deictic gestures. The robot was partially teleoperated to avoid the difficulty of speech recognition as well as to furnish a new kind of knowledge that only humans can flexibly provide. The information supplied by a human operator was later used to increase the robot’s autonomy. For 25 days in a shopping mall, we conducted a field trial and gathered 2642 interactions. A total of 235 participants signed up to use RFID tags and, later, provided questionnaire responses. The questionnaire results are promising in terms of the visitors’ perceived acceptability as well as the encouragement of their shopping activities. The results of the teleoperation analysis revealed that the amount of teleoperation gradually decreased, which is also promising."

Falkenburg \n David H. Hill \nSeeing beyond corporate cultural boundaries is a necessary first step toward effective process integration and corporate transformation. But to ignore national culture is to invite failure. OVERVIEW: Culture creates barriers to business process reengineering. Three distinctive levels of culture must be recognized in process redesign-national, corporate and work group culture. American national culture has the most profound influence. Individualism and autonomy are key features of American culture that work against the logic of process integration and commonization by rewarding individuals for pursuing their own self-interests. This tendency also generates a lack of trust, which in turn creates barriers to sharing electronic data. Reengineering difficulties are exacerbated by an American fascination with technological solutions, and a view of new technology as a silver bullet that yields benefits automatically. Often, process redesign cannot be implemented without culture change. Culture can be influenced by exposing internal groups to external pressures, ensuring employee participation in reengineering, recognizing that training alone does not achieve culture change, redefining group boundaries, managing anti-champions, building trust, and leveraging the strengths of national and corporate culture. To compete effectively in world markets, many American corporations are attempting to redesign basic processes in ways that enable closer collaboration or integration of Marietta Baba is professor and chair of the Department of Anthropology at Wayne State University, in Detroit, Michigan.

Integration of business processes often is equated with the introduction of new information technology (IT). Investing in IT, however, does not guarantee benefits. In a review of several recent studies, Majchrzak reported failure rates for the implementation of computer-automated technology in American industry that ranged from 30 to 75 percent (1). One explanation for these difficulties is that IT is only an enabler of better business processes; as an enabler, it cannot of itself achieve process improvement. Adler and others have reviewed in detail changes in workforce skills, work procedures, organizational structure, strategy, and culture that must accompany the introduction of advanced computer-automation if corporations are to realize the full benefits of IT (2). Culture in particular is mentioned frequently as an important factor affecting redesign efforts, but its nature and implications typically are not understood sufficiently to provide a base of knowledge for planned culture change. In this article, we address this need by exploring the role of culture in business process-redesign, and by providing suggestions for managers who are engaged in implementing new information technology aimed at process change. Although cultural factors may affect virtually any element of a process redesign initiation (e. …"

I situate the press in terms of neo-institutional sociology, seeing its autonomy as a distributed, field-level phenomenon involving boundary work among distributed actors. I then trace press-audience relations through two historical examples letters to the editor and ombudsmen, showing how the press has historically both separated itself from and relied upon audiences. Examining eight news organizations’ social media policies, I analyze the inside-out and outside-in forces through which the press distinguishes itself from audiences, concluding with a discussion of how such guidelines structure the types of control that news organizations have, or might have, as they use social network sites in their news work."

Mrayyan \nBackground.  Autonomy plays an important part in nurses’ job satisfaction and retention, but the literature shows that they are often dissatisfied with this aspect and want better working conditions and greater autonomy in decision-making.\nAims.  The aim of this study was to examine the role that nurse managers have in enhancing hospital staff nurses’ autonomy.\nMethods.  The study used a comparative descriptive survey design. Data collection took place over the Internet through the use of selective listservs in the United States of America (USA), Canada, and the United Kingdom. Of the 317 hospital nurses participating, 264 (83·3%) were from the USA. Differences relating to nurses, nurse managers, and hospital settings were controlled in the analysis.\nResults.  Nurses were more autonomous in making patient care decisions than unit operational decisions, and they perceived their autonomy to be at a moderate level. Those who were autonomous in patient care decision-making were also likely to be autonomous in unit operation decision-making. Nurse managers’ actions had a strong relationship with nurses’ autonomy in deciding on patient care and unit operation decisions, and with total autonomy. The three important variables that were reported by staff nurses to increase their autonomy were supportive management, education and experience. The three most important factors that were reported to decrease nurses’ autonomy were autocratic management, doctors and workload.\nDiscussion.  Technical issues such as the availability of listservs, valid e-mails, viruses, and familiarity with the Internet and its applications were the major limitations of this study. Nurses’ autonomy over patient care and unit operations decisions needs to be enhanced, and nurse managers should promote this. Similarly, there is a role for nurse education, both in preregistration programmes and in continuing education for managers. Further research needs to explore the barriers that nurses face in autonomous decision-making and how nurses’ participation in unit operational decisions can be promoted.\nConclusions.  Hospital staff nurses have moderate autonomy which could be increased by more effective support from nurse managers. The use of electronic questionnaires is a promising data collection method."

Global society can be seen as an autopoietic network of self-producing components, and therefore as a living system or ‘superorganism’. Miller’s living systems theory suggests a list of functional components for society’s metabolism and nervous system. Powers’ perceptual control theory suggests a model for a distributed control system implemented through the market mechanism. An analysis of the evolution of complex, networked systems points to the general trends of increasing efficiency, differentiation and integration. In society these trends are realized as increasing productivity, decreasing friction, increasing division of labor and outsourcing, and increasing cooperativity, transnational mergers and global institutions. This is accompanied by increasing functional autonomy of individuals and organisations and the decline of hierarchies. The increasing complexity of interactions and instability of certain processes caused by reduced friction necessitate a strengthening of society’s capacity for information processing and control, i.e. its nervous system. This is realized by the creation of an intelligent global computer network, capable of sensing, interpreting, learning, thinking, deciding and initiating actions: the ‘global brain’. Individuals are being integrated ever more tightly into this collective intelligence. Although this image may raise worries about a totalitarian system that restricts individual initia"

Changes in the division of labour result from reduced production time and improved communication possibilities. The first shifts the division of labour towards generic structures, while the latter enhances specialisation. Our estimates for a sample of Dutch establishments in the period 1990‐6 suggest that productivity gains have been the main determinant for shifts in the division of labour. These productivity gains induced skill upgrading, while in firms gaining from improved communication possibilities specialisation increased and skill requirements have fallen. The rapid spread of computer technology has led to substantial changes in the division of labour and a shift in the demand for labour in favour of skilled workers. Mostly these changes have been accompanied by flatter organisational structures, larger autonomy for workers or workgroups, the application of innovative human resource management practices and so on. There are also less typical examples where computerisation is associated with increased specialisation (e.g., the rapid increase of call-centres), scripting of communication with clients and stricter procedures. Although the empirical relationship between information and communication technology (ICT) adoption and organisational change has been well-documented, disagreement remains about the reasons why computerisation provides firms with incentives to change the structure of their organisation and the skill requirements of their workforce."

This changes the way students work and communicate, altering their relationship with knowledge, and generating new objectives for media literacy in the digital society. Thus, schools face new challenges and this paper aims at highlighting four of them. A first challenge relates to trust. Web 2.0 opens the classroom to the world and educators have to face new dangers and irrelevant uses, while bringing their students to gain better access to information and culture. The second challenge relates to teachers’ professional identities. The role of teachers is changing as Web 2.0 tools are being used by students, and policymakers should take this into account. A third challenge relates to a growing need to control working time, timetable organization and rhythm in schools. The fourth challenge that we underline is the need for common rules that allow students to benefit from the opportunities offered by Web 2.0 to develop their autonomy and to foster ethical practices."

There have been changes in the composition of both the region and its component municipios,1 and these have led to a loss of political unity, the transformation of the dominant role of the comon or community,2 the incorporation of new actors at the local level, and local participation in universally shared discourses. My interest in these changes dates to January 1994, when the EZLN and the Mexican government became involved in a political and armed confrontation. On February 16, 1996, the two sides signed their first agreement (known as the San Andres Accords), in which indigenous autonomy occupies a central role and is presented as inextricably linked to the concepts of democracy, justice, and pluralism.3 These are, however, very general postulates that need to be examined in the light of regionally distinct realities and the particular histories of the various indigenous communities living in Chiapas and in Mexico more broadly. Unfortunately, negotiations between the EZLN and the government came to a halt at the end of 1996, when it had become clear to the EZLN that the government was not honoring its promise to respect the concessions it had negotiated. From that time until the present (spring 2000), the national and international media have strongly emphasized the necessity of reinitiating formal negotiations and dialogue on the national level-that is, between the major parties, the EZLN and the federal government. However, this focus on high-level talks has obscured the fact that on a regional level local actors have been engaged in dialogue all along.4 Not surprisingly, these negotiations are neither documented on the Internet"

Aram Donabedian \n John Carey \nBecause the new processes of domination to which people react are embedded in information flows, the building of autonomy has to rely on reverse information flows. –Manuel Castells, The Power of Identity Introduction In recent decades, advances in information technology have vastly increased the channels by which librarians and educators can connect patrons or students with relevant resources. Certainly, it is difficult for librarians today–whether in reference or technical services–to imagine doing their jobs without access to online databases, internet resources, cataloging or circulation software, and the many other tools we now take for granted. Similarly, it is difficult to imagine contemporary patrons voluntarily relinquishing the ability to search OPACs, export bibliographic citations, retrieve full-text articles from thousands of journals, or contact a librarian at all hours via e-mail, chat, or text messaging. These new information-seeking habits of patrons drive libraries–and librarians–to keep up with new applications of technology, whether by using blogs and social networking sites to help promote the services we offer or by ensuring remote access to library resources on mobile devices. Given this centrality of technology to the evolving practice of contemporary librarianship–especially academic librarianship–it is difficult to remember that not all librarians welcomed the appearance of computers in libraries during the transformative era of the 1990s. Yet if we agree with Ranganathan’s most basic principles that books are for use and that librarians should save the time of the reader, why would any librarian object to new tools that help connect more users with more resources, more quickly than ever (Ranganathan, 1963)? Some, perhaps, felt threatened by the new skill sets required or the uncertainty of a transitional period. However, this paper will argue that the deeper answer points to a fundamental question of how librarians view our profession, its mission, and its role in fostering the values essential to liberal education and democracy. The technology that has enabled libraries to expand their roles has also led them to depend increasingly upon powerful commercial publishers, even as governments surrender more and more oversight to these corporate interests. Increasing consolidation of major media channels–including sources of scholarly communication–has allowed a shrinking number of corporations to control distribution and access to the materials libraries offer, through licensing fees, copyright restrictions, and digital rights management. If left unchecked, this trend threatens to stifle access to the information students need to construct knowledge, thereby undermining information literacy, critical pedagogy, and the development of those critical thinking skills so crucial to the mission of liberal education. I. Critical Pedagogy and the Threat to Liberal Education In order to understand how libraries arrived at this crossroads, it is instructive to assess the traditionally agreed upon values of libraries and liberal education, and to examine why some librarians felt those values to be under attack when technology took a larger role in libraries. Within the larger world of higher education, advocates for liberal education in the humanities argue that the critical thinking skills engendered in these fields can fortify an open society against domination by corporate or political elites. In her recently released book Why Democracy Needs the Humanities, the philosopher Martha Nussbaum argues that [a]s the critical thinking taught by the humanities is replaced by the unexamined life of the job-seekers, our ability to argue rights and wrongs is silenced. In a society of unreflective, undiscerning yes-men and yes-women, politics becomes meaner and business can invite disasters such as the economic meltdown or the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico (Allemang, 2010, p. …"

This article aims to explain differences between a group learning English on a Facebook page and a face-to-face group in terms of Self-Determination Theory (SDT). SDT focuses on three main variables, which improve self-determination and motivation outside but also inside the classroom: autonomy, competence and relatedness. The main research question was: how can we explain differences between a face-to-face group (FTF) and a Facebook group learning a foreign language in terms of autonomy, competence and relatedness? The results indicate that there was a significant difference between the two groups in terms of learning outcomes as well as in the three SDT variables. Students in the Facebook group felt more autonomous, competent and related. All three SDT variables correlated with learning outcomes. There was, however, almost no relationship among the SDT variables with learning outcomes within the two groups. The strongest predictor of the difference in learning outcomes proved to be relatedness, followed by competence."

In this context, the location of female subjectivity posits an interesting field of enquiry, primarily because women have often been projected as epitomizing these new economic spaces in the visual images and corporate billboards that dot the urban cityscape.

Weblog (blog or web log) can be one of the instructional and integral components for ESL instructors. By applying interview and observation, this study reports on ESL students’ experience and perceptions in applying weblog throughout a semester in a writing class in Malaysia. Besides, this study examined the effect of using Weblog on students’ writing autonomy. The findings revealed that students enjoyed the process of publishing their writings, and exchanging their experience in the weblog. Students also acknowledged weblog as a tool which provides more opportunities to publish their writing freely, extend their interaction with their peers outside the class setting, be able to publish and share interesting videos, have the chance to look for the appropriate materials in the World Wide Web (WWW) and check their sentences in the Google simultaneously. Students enjoyed some features in weblog which cannot be found in conventional modes of teaching and learning, such as experiencing unlimited time and place, more independency and freedom in publishing and exchanging comments. With the empirical data presented in this study, weblog can be applied as a suitable instructional tool to promote autonomy among language learners."

Durowoju \nHigher Education is the climax of the process of providing knowledge, changing learners attitude and inculcating specialized skills in individuals preparatory to taking a life-long employment with intent to earning a living and equally contributing to national economic growth and development. The Teaching and learning process is cardinal to the realization of the educational objectives of any nation. The advent of information and communication technology has made teaching and learning easier and beyond the traditional face to face interaction between the teacher and the learner. E-learning basically involving the transfer of skills and knowledge through an electronic device aims at improving the teaching/learning process. In spite of the benefits of e-learning to both regular students and distance learners, e-learning has been fraught with some challenges in Africa. Therefore, this paper discusses some of the challenges facing e-learning in Africa particularly in the Nigerian higher education system. These among others are epileptic power supply, high cost of procurement of computer hardware, inadequate infrastructure, and resistance to change on the part of the instructors, inability of learners to make use of ICT infrastructure, inadequate skilled manpower ICT, and corruption of computer storage device through viruses. Effectively managing the identified challenges means that the government would have to ensure regular power supply, lecturers and learners should be trained in the use of ICT infrastructure, and the government should evolve viable ICT policy as well as control or subsidise the price of the s of ICT infrastructure to make it affordable for both lecturers and learners.

However, this study showed that Facebook, as a nonymous platform in which people are in contact with their already-made social ties, didn’t seem to be liberating from the existing norms and rules within society. Facebook was a stage that became restricted with the involvement of social ties. The study’s analysis of interviews with six young Iranians showed that social meanings and norms of self-presentation on Facebook are defined to a large degree in terms of gender. The informants used a variety of strategies when presenting themselves on Facebook. They used Facebook simply for gaining personal autonomy. Strategies were adopted especially when one’s personal and community needs were in conflict. Efforts made to apply strategies were gendered and were used mainly by females. Males conformed to and women resisted societal norms and expectations."

We analysed one blended and one virtual case from two different universities. The study aimed at identifying specific patterns of educational support intended to foster two interaction processes: (1) the promotion of greater autonomy in the students and (2) the construction of more appropriate meanings by them. The analysis showed that these two processes were achieved with different attainment levels in each of the two study cases. Specific patterns of support mediated by technology were found underlying these different results. This led us to identify ‘suitable’ and ‘undesirable’ patterns of support in e-assessment practices."

The study explores both global and specific factors of personality using Eysenck’s EPQ-R short form extraversion, neuroticism and psychoticism and Beck’s SAS sociotropy and autonomy. Principal component analysis identified ten distinct motivational components, which were then successfully predicted by individual differences through regression analyses.

The Impact of Funding Agencies in Formulating Research Questions \nhttps://doi.org/10.46743/2160-3715/2013.1426\n Massimiliano Tarozzi \nIt is a well-known post-positivist myth that the empirical researcher can be neutral politically and ethically with his/her field, and even many qualitative researchers somehow agree with this statement, since neutrality seems to guarantee inquiry’s rigor, trustworthiness, and legitimacy (Diebel, 2008). The researcher is supposed to be politically independent in designing the research project and ethically detached from the participants. The paradigm turn (Lincoln & Guba, 1985; Denzin & Lincoln, 2005) and especially the critical theory paradigm has powerfully criticized this assumption from a political perspective (Kincheloe & McLaren, 2005). In particular, many scholars have argued that locating funding for qualitative research is a political process (Cheek, 2005; Roth, 2002). However, what I would like to illustrate here is that the funding body has also a methodological impact of which the researcher should be aware and should learn to deal with. Few years ago, I was funded by a broadcasting company associated with the former Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi. This circumstance made me very concerned and unsettled for many reasons. But this was also the reason for taking very seriously the problem of the ethical (and political) underpinnings of funded qualitative research. Doing research under these circumstances made me understandably worried about the possibility to carry out my research with the autonomy I wanted. The research topic–television experience of 3-6 years old children–was very controversial and a heated debate divided, and still is dividing, professionals, academics, NGOs in two opposite perspectives on the role of TV viewing for little children. And I actually realized that the impact of funding agencies also has methodological consequences on the research practice. After a brief review of some main positions about the issue of the development of the research topic and the research question, I will examine the sources from where a topic or a general problem comes about, and then how it can be shaped into a workable research question. In this passage, I identify four specific constraints. In this paper, however, I will deepen only one of them: the funder-related constraints. I will illustrate the methodological impact of funding agencies by presenting a case of a research on the use of television in families, funded by a mixed board of television industries and children’s advocate groups. Then, I will show four possible solutions to the methodological problem of funding related to four different paradigms, and, finally, I will present what we actually did in our research to deal with this issue. 1. Choosing a Topic Choosing a research topic (or problem) in qualitative inquiry and establishing a workable research question are two different, but interrelated processes, and it is difficult to define which one comes first or after (Miles & Huberman, 1994). Researchers are always embodied in the world they wish to explore and their stance is never neutral or separate from the world in which they live. So the research question that one cuts off from the whole topic is difficult to isolate like a figure on the background. However, in the practice of research the passage from the first step to the second step is necessary, and represents one of the most difficult processes, especially (but not only) for novices (Silverman, 2000). Traditionally, every research comes from a topic that then requires to be transformed (or reduced) into an experimental hypothesis or a focused research question. Quantitative research calls this delicate passage operationalization–the transformation of abstract concept in something measurable. By the way at the beginning of the 1970s even some qualitative methodologists talked about operationalization too (Schatzman & Strauss, 1973, p. 101; see also Denzin, 1971). Before examining the problems in qualitative research that are also related to the transformation/reduction of a concept into a workable research question, it is interesting to see how a research theme emerges and how one considers a research area as relevant. …"

Orlikowski \n JoAnne Yates \nOur research examines how knowledge professionals use mobile email devices to get their work done and the implications of such use for their autonomy to control the location, timing, and performance of work. We found that knowledge professionals using mobile email devices to manage their communication were enacting a norm of continual connectivity and accessibility that produced a number of contradictory outcomes. Although individual use of mobile email devices offered these professionals flexibility, peace of mind, and control over interactions in the short term, it also intensified collective expectations of their availability, escalating their engagement and thus reducing their ability to disconnect from work. Choosing to use their mobile email devices to work anywhere/anytime—actions they framed as evidence of their personal autonomy—the professionals were ending up using it everywhere/all the time, thus diminishing their autonomy in practice. This autonomy paradox reflected professionals’ ongoing navigation of the tension between their interests in personal autonomy on the one hand and their professional commitment to colleagues and clients on the other. We further found that this dynamic has important unintended consequences—reaffirming and challenging workers’ sense of themselves as autonomous and responsible professionals while also collectively shifting the norms of how work is and should be performed in the contemporary workplace."

    "text": "Doc 423 :  Health and psychosocial effects of flexible working hours \nhttps://doi.org/10.1590/s0034-89102004000700003\n Daniela Janssen \n Friedhelm Nachreiner \nOBJECTIVE: To examine whether any impairments in health and social lives can be found under different kinds of flexible working hours, and whether such effects are related to specific characteristics of these working hours. METHODS: Two studies - a company based survey (N=660) and an internet survey (N=528) - have been conducted. The first one was a questionnaire study (paper and pencil) on employees working under some ‘typical’ kinds of different flexible working time arrangements in different companies and different occupational fields (health care, manufacturing, retail, administration, call centres). The second study was an internet-based survey, using an adaptation of the questionnaire from the first study. RESULTS: The results of both studies consistently show that high variability of working hours is associated with increased impairments in health and well-being and this is especially true if this variability is company controlled. These effects are less pronounced if variability is self-controlled; however, autonomy does not compensate the effects of variability. CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations for an appropriate design of flexible working hours should be developed in order to minimize any impairing effects on health and psychosocial well-being; these recommendations should include - besides allowing for discretion in controlling one’s (flexible) working hours - that variability in flexible working hours should be kept low (or at least moderate), even if this variability is self-controlled."

Observation of real - effective - functioning of that legal tool reveals in a paradigmatic way the identity of the social post-modern individual whose freedom is both immense and insignificant, an unlimited source of power and servile subjection to directives by public and private organizations which establish what we should want in order to want effectively. Exercising that prerogative means adhering to norms that really impose themselves regardless of their sources, but at a degree that can be determined. Such degree - sociologically interesting and politically useful - implies a broad definition of normative and legal pluralism, as Gurvitch proposed. That definition, without exclusions and quite inaccurate, has the advantage (as well as the inconvenience) of warranting men of Law as the new professionals of certain domains that recently used to be strange to them. To those who question the opportunity of such interventions, it could be answered that in practice they are often effective guarantees against arbitrariness. Therefore, this work presents examples of that recent development within the field of sports Law and the protection of privacy (especially on the Internet). In any case, those new spaces have been conquered by literate people and thus Legal sociologists have no other option than taking an interest in them if they want to be professionally faithful to phenomena within their field."

Recent developments, which include the growing role of English as a lingua franca and computer-mediated communication (CMC), give rise to fluid and emergent contexts in which speakers from a variety of language and cultural backgrounds interact. It is argued that the current training-oriented view of learner autonomy in ELT, with its focus on learning processes, should be amended to enable learners to cope with the challenges of communication in the twenty-first century. In this article, an approach that shifts the attention to language use is suggested, where autonomy is developed through tasks and activities that engage learners on their own terms and allow them to effectively exploit their linguistic resources in online negotiation of meaning."

Thus, we have adapted the technology adoption model (TAM) to evaluate the perceptions of the members of virtual communities of professionals hosted inside social networking sites regarding their autonomy, the openness of the sites, the diversity of the members of the networks and the interactivity when using these sites. Social networking sites are beneficial for knowledge exchange since their openness influences diversity of members and ideas. Usefulness increases when users feel to have more autonomy in managing their activity in the sites. Autonomy and diversity of the members are key factors because they influence the level of interactivity inside the network."

There is an increasing need for caregivers, who are well-trained, experienced and can pay special attention to the needs of people with dementia. Technology can play an important role in helping such people and their caregivers. A lack of mutual understanding between caregivers and researchers regarding the appropriate uses of assistive technologies is another problem. A vision of person-centred care based on the use of information and communication technology to maintain residents’ autonomy and continuity in their lives is presented. Based on this vision, a roadmap and a list of challenges to realizing assistive technologies have been developed. The roadmap facilitates mutual understanding between caregivers and researchers, resulting in appropriate technologies to enhance the quality of life of people with dementia."

    "text": "Doc 428 :  Some Factors to Consider when Designing Semi-Autonomous Learning Environments. \nhttps://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ867106.pdf\n Paul Bouchard \nThis research aims to answer the question, what ways do mediated learning environments support or hinder learner autonomy? Learner autonomy has been identified as one important factor in the success of mediated learning environments. The central aspect of learner autonomy is the control that the learner exercises over the various aspects of learning, beginning with the decision to learn or not to learn. But as Candy (1995) points out, there are several areas where learner-control can be exercised. The first are the motivational-intentional forces that drive the learner to apply some determination (or vigour) to the act of learning. They are the conative functions of learning and include learner intiative, motivation and personal involvement. They are often associated with life goals that are independent of the actual learning goals pursued within the strict confines of the learning environment (Long, 1994). The second area of learner-control is the one comprising the nuts-and-bolts of the act of learning, such as defining learning goals, deciding on a learning sequence, choosing a workable pacing of learning activities, and selecting learning resources (Hrimech & Bouchard, 1998). These are the algorithmic aspects of learning, and in traditional schooling, they are the sole responsibility of the teacher. In mediated learning environments, it can be shared between the platform and the actual learner. Just a few years ago, learner control was necessarily limited to these two sets of features, conative and algorithmic. Today however, with the proliferation of educational offerings in both the private and public sector, as well as the developments in educational technology, two other aspects of the learning environment emerge as important areas where learner-control can be exercised. The semiotic dimension of learner-control includes the symbolic platforms used to convey information and meaning, for example web pages, hypertext, video/audio multimedia, animation, each of these bringing with them their own specific set of possibilities and limitations for autonomy in learning. And then again, all learning environments exist in their own distinct economic sphere where decisions about whether, what and how to learn are made on the basis of cost-benefit, opportunity cost, and extrinsic market value. We will examine the implications of each of these areas of learner-control, and share our analysis of a series of interviews with cyber-learners, based on this framework of conative, algorithmic, semiotic and economic factors."

It is argued that the routinisation of informed consent poses a threat to the protection of the personal autonomy of a patient through the negotiation of informed consent. On the basis of a large survey, we provide evidence of the routinisation of informed consent in various types of interaction on the internet; among these, the routinisation of consent to the exchange of health related information. We also provide evidence that the extent of the routinisation of informed consent is dependent on the character of the information exchanged, and we uncover a range of causes of routinisation. Finally, the article discusses possible ways of countering the problem of routinisation of informed consent."

These are resources they must use carefully if they wish to protect their autonomy as well as their influence. The interaction of science, technology, and public policy is emerging again as an important sub ject of action and analysis given today’s public agenda.

Neoliberalism is marked by innovations that amplify and accelerate contradictions, unfolding the false utopia of finance capitalism. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) helped hyper-financialize the economy, enrich banksters and extend inequalities. Conversely, high-tech developments allow for decentralized decision-making and more direct democracy, paralleling the ethics of OWS. New ICTs compress TimeSpace, opening doors for empathic connections, generating conditions for elevation of collective superstructural consciousness. This paper explores how these conditions create – and are recreated by – heterotopic spaces. Drawing on Foucault’s method of heterotopology we throw light on the potential of OWS to prefigure another world, analyzing endeavors to promote cooperative autonomy, and raise consciousness in and through mediated environments, always contested, ever in flux, and inevitably over-(but never pre-)determined."

While candidates have proven to be adept at gaming news coverage of their campaign advertisements, journalists have maintained their autonomy by curtailing coverage of the candidates’ stump speeches. The advent of online media, however, advantages the candidates by permitting direct communication between candidates and voters. Author Notes: Shanto Iyengar holds the Chandler Chair in Communication at Stanford University, where he is also a professor of political science. Ever since primary elections replaced conventions as the principal means of nominating candidates, the relationship between journalists and candidates has been critical to understanding the conduct of American political campaigns. Each side has clearly defined and conflicting objectives. Candidates covet the free and “objective” publicity provided by news reports. Reporters, for their part, are motivated to maintain their autonomy by debunking campaign rhetoric and “spin.” In the ensuing tussle over whose voice is to be heard, which side comes out ahead? Writing in 1993, well before the dawn of modern, technology-driven campaigns, Ansolabehere, Iyengar, and Behr gave the nod to the candidates and their handlers. The relationship between political figures and the media has changed dramatically since the advent of television. Politicians have been much quicker to adjust to these changes than the media. Elected officials, candidates, and their consultants have developed intricate strategies for using or evading the media to their advantage. The media, on the other hand, have only just begun to develop counterstrategies for protecting their independence. Elected officials are adept at inducing reporters to cover their activities in the best possible light. Reporters don’t always know how they’re being manipulated, and if they do, they don’t always know how to stop it. (234) If candidates had the superior game in the 1980s, there is a compelling case to be made that recent changes in the campaign environment have only strengthened their hand. In this essay, I update the strategic dance between candidates and the press in the area of the two main forms of campaign communication: paid advertising and “free” news coverage."

An empirical study \nhttps://doi.org/10.3917/grhu.090.0035\n Stéphanie Arnaud \n Jean-Louis Chandon \nThe use of monitoring devices (data collection) in business organizations is facilitated through New Information and Communication Technologies (NICT) such as fingerprint, facial or eyes biometric, time clocks, cyber surveillance, remote tracking of employees via GPS, and others. While standard economic theory advocates the use of incentive systems and surveillance to increase performance at work, some empirical studies show a fall in the level and quality of effort after the introduction of monitoring. Using self-determination theory (SDT), we explain this phenomenon by the negative impact of “monitoring systems extensiveness” on employees’ intrinsic motivation (IM). We hypothesize the mediation of this impact by the degree to which employees perceive their supervisors as being “autonomy supportive”. We also investigate the possibility of a moderating effect of “employees’ beliefs about the purposes of devices for monitoring” on the relationships between “monitoring systems extensiveness”, “perception of supervision” and “intrinsic motivation”. We test these hypotheses using a questionnaire, collected in France, from 579 employees having at least one supervisor. Developing a structural equation model, we find: firstly, a significant crowding out effect of IM by monitoring; secondly, this crowding out effect is significantly mediated by employees’ perception of supervision; thirdly, we confirm a strong positive relation between an autonomy supportive supervision and IM. Finally, we do not find any significant moderation by employees’ beliefs about the purposes attributed to monitoring devices."

Who deserves the credit? Chinese national leaders answered yes to the first question and pointed to themselves as the answer to the second. This essay maintains, however, that local state actors played the central and effectively centralizing role in (xinxihua) projects in Nanhai City, Guangdong province. Through local e-government projects and a series of policies regarding land use, financing, and personnel training, the Nanhai government was able to shape the emerging local economy in a way that limited entrepreneurial autonomy for small-scale start-ups in the Internet industry. The highly centralized campaign fundamentally reversed Nanhai’s renowned decentralized model of rural industrialization. Through this process, a fractured system emerged for the and meanings attached to and to the city itself. This was manifested in everyday practice and discourse among local policymakers, entrepreneurs in both new and old economies, and average residents with different (mis)perceptions of the Internet influenced by their gender. At the formal policy level, the trend toward centralization was most obvious, revolving around the formation of a nebulous public network space being constructed by the city using technological, administrative, and rhetorical devices. Yet the private practices and perceptions of Internet that defined Nanhai’s informational landscape persisted in a fractured manner at the same time, leading to major corruption scandals and the implosion of the grandiose technology campaign. To understand such a paradoxical process, this article examines the contextual and internal factors for Nanhai’s Internet buildup. From a critical and historical perspective, it highlights a long-term seesaw battle along the problematic public-private borderline regarding issues of urbanization and in contemporary Chinese cities. This article reflects on the restructuring of local power relations and the role of informatization policy discourse therein. A crucial, yet often overlooked, dimension of reform in China today is the migration and subsequent transformation of technosocial meaning across different scales of and operations. The discursive process often has a transnational reach and tends to follow a political logic that usually only makes sense against the backdrop of the local history."

In such a scenario, appropriated methodologies are needed to manage the interactions among agents. The BRAIN framework proposes an interaction model based on roles, each one composed by a set of capabilities and an expected behavior. The achieved advantages are agentoriented features, separation of concerns and reuse of solutions and experiences. In this paper we present two interaction infrastructures, Rolesystem and RoleX, which rely on the above mentioned role-based interaction model. These infrastructures allow agents to assume roles and to interact. An application example and the comparison with other approaches show the efiectiveness"

The complexity of the Spanish political-administrative system makes such a study challenging, in view of the considerable degree of autonomy and competences of the regional administrative bodies and local agencies with respect to the central government, the former being more visible in the 17 regions of Spain. Nonetheless, the central government maintains a series of legal instruments that allow a certain common framework of action to be imposed, aside from what is put into effect through diverse programs aimed precisely to develop common tools for the regions and municipalities of Spain. After an introduction that provides some necessary background, this study describes the legislative framework in which Spain’s electronic administrative system has developed. The data included in the study refer to investment in information and communication technologies (ICT) and the services offered by the different Administrations on the internet; internet access by citizens, homes, businesses, and employees, as well as the interactivity existing with administrations by means of the internet; the origins and rise of various political initiatives of the Central Government involving electronic administration; and finally, the situation of civil service personnel, as catalysts of the success of Information Society in the Public Administration within Spain."

Information and communication technologies (ICTs) candepending how they are usedpositively or negatively affect the availability of records for accountability. Dominant trends in the effect of ICTs records management are (1) the mixing of on the record and off the record communication, (2) the shift of control over information to the individual, (3) the focus present rather than historic information, (4) the interlinking of information managed by several organizations, and (5) the integration of procedures into computer systems. These trends indicate that the introduction of ICTs challenges the existing balance between organizational values (e.g., formality and informality, central control and individual autonomy). Electronic records management is therefore about finding an organizational design that balances values to fit the organization’s accountability situation."

Some female university students have decided that ova donation may be an acceptable alternative in which to pay for their tuition. This alternative presents itself because of the insufficient number of ova available for assisted reproduction and emerging stem cell technologies. Young female university students are encouraged by Internet sources and respectable electronic and print media to donate their ova in the cause of assisted reproduction for monetary compensation. While university students generally exhibit autonomy, the constraining influence of their financial predicament compromises the elements of informed consent (voluntariness, competence, capacity, understanding, and disclosure) as to their making an autonomous decision in regard to egg donation. Thus, any moral possibility of giving informed consent is negated. Informed consent can only occur through autonomy. A female university student in need of financial resources to pay for her education cannot make an autonomous choice to trade her genes for tuition. Donated ova are not only needed for assisted reproduction, but for stem cell technologies. While the long-term health of women who donate their ova is of concern (a potential risk of cancer after long term use of ovulation induction), of equal concern is the possibility of a growth in the trade of ova targeting third world and Eastern European women where the precedence for autonomy and informed consent is not well established."

Performance of these activities has been considered as an indicator of their learner autonomy. The data were collected through an online questionnaire and interviews. The study shows that in general learners do not demonstrate autonomous language learning behaviour. They prefer learning English in a relaxed environment particularly by engaging in entertaining activities, and through note-taking. However, they do not have sufficient interaction with their facilitator, other learners or speakers. Although the participants are distance learners, they do not prefer Internet-based activities. Conditions stemming from adulthood, lack of skills necessary to perform an activity, lack of awareness of some activities and learners’ experiences in their previous years of education are some of the reasons for their unautonomous behaviour. The article also includes suggestions for teaching and future research."

The focus is on basic mechanisms that could be seen as underlying “getting things in motion” and change in education systems. Four mechanisms are distinguished: synoptic rational planning, the market mechanism, cybernetics, and autopoiesis. Principles relevant for effective school improvement that are deducted from these basic mechanisms are: goal setting for improvement, pressures to improve, cyclical improvement processes, and autonomy. The article also briefly touches upon the way empirical models of school effectiveness and school improvement can be linked and used in the encompassing model of effective school improvement that the ESI project has yielded."

New information and communication technologies (ICT) have the potential to assist those caring for people with dementia, through access to networked information and support, tracking and surveillance. This article reports the views about such new technologies of 34 carers of people with dementia. We also held a group discussion with nine carers for respondent validation. The carers’ actual use of new ICT was limited, although they thought a gradual increase in the use of networked technology in dementia care was inevitable but would bypass some carers who saw themselves as too old. Carers expressed a general enthusiasm for the benefits of ICT, but usually not for themselves, and they identified several key challenges including: establishing an appropriate balance between, on the one hand, privacy and autonomy and, on the other: maximising safety; establishing responsibility for and ownership of the equipment and who bears the costs; the possibility that technological help would mean a loss of valued personal contact; and the possibility that technology would substitute for existing services rather than be complementary. For carers and dementia sufferers to be supported, the expanding use of these technologies should be accompanied by intensive debate of the associated issues."

It has been particularly identified to give EFL students more opportunities to express ideas, enhance their engagement in learning activities and promote their confidence during virtual interactions. These benefits coincide with attributes of a learning environment that can foster learner autonomy. Therefore, this paper reports on an investigation into the impacts of the employment of a web 2.0 Learning Management System (LMS) in an EFL course. Data extracted from individual interviews with four undergraduate students in a Vietnamese university was analyzed to illustrate possible effects of LMS in students’ ability to initiate, monitor and evaluate their learning process. The presentation continues with a discussion on the cyclic relationship among these three capabilities. It also addresses the local students’ perspective on socializing and academic activities as well as the relationship between them in the socio-cultural context of Vietnam. It then concludes with implications for EFL teaching practices with the adoption of LMS and puts forward suggestions for further research."

It addressed the ways in which young women tactically use the social media in order to negotiate the sexual controls they encountered in everyday life. Taking the teenage girls’ point of view, this paper argues that, as active agents, young women achieve a certain level of sexual autonomy and construct their own sexual selves in modern northern Thai society, despite their parents’ attempts to prevent this. The paper highlights the ways in which social media are used by Thai girls in order to achieve such a goal. Research findings should inform the development of future programmes on sexual health promotion, parental skills and sexual communication between Thai parents and their children."

However, even when afforded such an apparently instrumental role, several important elements of the Internet are based on, and oriented towards, culture, identity and collectivity, and relate to a symbolically un-fragmented system that remains largely unconscious. In this paper we appropriate the concept of ontological security to explore the autonomy of the cultural dimension of online search, which has gone largely unanalysed in the literature. Ontological security is the unconscious sense that individuals have about the continuity and order in events related to their lives. At the collective level, it relates to the stability of the symbolic structures of society, which are both inclusive and exclusionary. Through a se…"

In this paper, I suggest that the legal protection of the right to online privacy within the US should be strengthened. Traditionally, in identifying where support can be found in the US Constitution for a right to informational privacy, the point of focus has been on the Fourth Amendments protection in this context finds its moral basis in personal liberty, personal dignity, self-esteem, and other values. On the other hand, the constitutional right to privacy first established by Griswold v. Connecticut finds its moral basis largely in a single value, the value of autonomy of decision-making. I propose that an expanded constitutional right to informational privacy, responsive to the escalating threats posed to online privacy by developments in informational technology, would be more likely to find a solid moral basis in the value of autonomy associated with the constitutional right to privacy found in Griswold than in the variety of values forming the moral basis for the right to privacy backed by the Fourth Amendment."

At age 20, youth self-reported on their online behaviors, youths’ social networking webpages were observationally coded to assess peer relationship quality online, and symptoms of depression and social anxiety were reassessed. Results suggested that problematic mother-teen relationships were predictive of youths’ later preference for online communication and greater likelihood of forming a friendship with someone met online, yet poorer quality in online relationships.

However, how to establish trust among strangers without prior relationship and common security domain poses much difficulty for these activities. To resolve these problems, a promising approach known as Automated Trust Negotiation (ATN), which establishes the trust between strangers with iterative disclosure of credentials and access control policies, is proposed. In this paper, a comprehensive survey of research on ATN is presented, and some basic techniques, e.g. negotiation model and architecture, access control policy specification, credential description and credential chain discovery, are introduced and compared. Then based on the analysis of the shortcomings and problems of the techniques, the trend of research and application is discussed. All these work may contribute to the further work on trust establishment for entities with privacy protection and autonomy in open internet."

Adolescence coincides with the onset of puberty and is typically described by parents as a period in which they attune to their child’s growing need for autonomy and greater desire to source social support from same aged peers. Many adolescents look forward to the transition to secondary school as it represents a period of possibilities; a time to master new academic, social, emotional and extracurricular activities (1). However, adapting to multiple formal and informal organizational and social relational structures that are inextricably linked with the high school environment can prove particularly daunting to transitioning students (2).Transitioning from primary school to a secondary boarding school adds another layer of complexity to secondary school life, as students have to simultaneously adjust from a situation where home and school are separate, into a setting where a temporary new home and schooling are merged together. Although some boarding students have reported the transition to boarding school has given them a greater appreciation for family and home, other students have equally reported that the process of adapting to new boarding school duty of care rules and regulations can be difficult as they tend to reduce privacy and personal freedom. Moreover, it commands boarding students to almost instantly display high levels of self-reliance, life skills and independence Similarly, boarding school requires adjusting from a situation where contact with family members occurs on a daily face-to-face basis to a situation where for extended periods of time contact is limited to contact via telephone, Skype and other means of communication such as email and text messages. Others have also described this change as shifting from vertical relationships with parents to horizontal relationships with peers at school and within the boarding house (3).Friendship and peer support are needed for the development of social, emotional and mental health and have been identified as important contributors to a successful school transition (4). Peers not only provide support, but information and guidance (5). However, a peak in bullying victimization occurs following the transition to secondary school (6) largely resulting from the pressure to attain high social status and the formalization of relationships and social roles in new social groups (7). The seriousness and negative impact of school bullying is well known contributing to significant physical, psychological and social wellbeing problems (8) which in turn effects academic performance (9).In boarding schools, a significantly larger amount of time is spent with peers (24 hours a day, 7 days a week) compared to day students (6 hours a day, 5 days a week). Arguably, the residential boarding context provides greater opportunity for bullying to occur (10, 11).Some have described bullying at boarding school as ‘relentless’ given that targets have fewer choices to minimize their exposure to bullying, with bullying often following the target from the day school setting into the residential setting (3). Evidence suggests bullying can become institutionalized into the culture of boarding schools that are not vigilant to its presence (11). Poynting and Donaldson (10) described peer-to-peer bullying in one Australian elite boys’ only boarding school as endemic and entrenched, taking the form of ridicule and racial slurs, physical and sexualized assault, all contained within a culture of intimidation and non-disclosure. In these instances bullying has been justified through language that constructs it as a ‘tradition’ or ‘initiation’ and analogous with a normal a rite of passage (12).The long term negative mental health and life trajectory implications for individuals that experience bullying and also perpetrate bullying while at school are increasing being acknowledged (13). …"

The investigation showed that, as a result of the possibilities both information technology and communication technology create to people, the evaluation process can not be limited to the logic of a post-procedural and definitive examination, it should rather be applied all time long, in all ways and for all activities and practices in a course environment. This approach has a multidimensional nature and is able to handle with the complexity of the related knowledge, taking into account many possibilities of interaction, different timing and spaces to learn and teach, the related interfaces as well as interdisciplinary approaches in the analyzed collaborative environment. The theoretical references have explored the evaluation concepts and its predominant practice, and examine several aspects of information and communication technology which apply to the education. Based on these two main fronts, other concepts have been considered in the theoretical field such as complexity, collaboration, time, space, interdisciplinary aspects, among others, which have allowed the research to have its basis on a framework of ideas from which the analysis have been brought to light in order to show the broad scope of the multidimensional learning evaluation in on-line collaborative environment, considering that such evaluation allows to set individual goals of students and teachers according to a pedagogical strategy that dialectically focuses the autonomy and the collective construction of knowledge. Another important point demonstrated in this investigation is that people are much more important than technologies, and that the collaboration between people is also important for an assessment of all moments, even considering the history of each participant as an individual who has a personal history and knowledge gathered from multiple sources and being continuously processed."

It lets natural, mutually supportive order emerge. In Western culture, though, much order is imposed. This causes conflict, which only increases complexity. This conflictual pattern has an antidote in systems practice: the systemic action–learning cycle. When used reflectively at the level of second-order cybernetics, this cycle embodies respect for autonomy. The UK Open University course T306: Managing Complexity—A Systems Approach teaches this action–learning cycle, and uses the cycle in its own teaching. In particular, it uses the cycle in its online conferences, to invite participation and dissolve conflict. This paper shows how."

This qualitative study of high school students at the conclusion of their four-play series suggests that cell phones shape the youth audience experience, that etiquette regarding the use of these powerful devices remains sharply contested, and that students apply a range of strategies to dealing with issues of power and agency around their use."

Orcun Madran \nResearch studies conducted in the area of e-learning and blended learning lead to the emergence of new concepts, which directly influence quality. Among these concepts, the ones taken into consideration for this research study are as follows: communication and collaboration, satisfaction, equity, and autonomy. The perceptions of students taking blended ICT courses in a private university in Turkey were gathered through an Online Learning Environment Survey (OLES). Additionally, the suggestions of instructors for improving the quality of blended learning were obtained through a focus group interview. The findings of this study show that the perceived communication, collaboration, and satisfaction levels of students vary according to their levels of computer and Internet literacy. Also, there are differences in the students’ satisfaction levels based on gender. The majority of students revealed that they considered themselves to be autonomous and equal in the blended learning environment. The findings of this research study, together with our review of recent literature, lead us to conclude that there are four major areas (containing several factors) that must be considered when developing a high-quality blended learning environment: technology, instructors, students, and pedagogy. Based on the findings, some practical suggestions for transforming traditional courses into blended ones are also offered at the end of the research study. Finally, suggestions for the future are provided."

Other theories, however, suggest that demanding conditions improve self-regulation by mobilizing super-ordinate control processes. The present article integrates both kinds of theories by proposing that the self-regulatory impact of demanding conditions depends on how people adapt to such conditions. When people are action-oriented, demanding conditions may lead to improved self-regulation. When people are state-oriented, demanding conditions may lead to impaired self-regulation. Consistent with this idea, action versus state orientation strongly moderates the influence of demands on self-regulatory performance. The impact of demanding conditions on self-regulation is thus not fixed, but modifiable by psychological processes. Demanding conditions are pervasive in everyday life. At the workplace, employees need to stay abreast of rapid technological innovations and deal with constant pressures towards increased efficiency and productivity. In educational settings, students must meet high standards of academic excellence, often while performing low-paying jobs to cover high tuitions and while taking care of their family members. Even among friends, there are always emails to be responded to, birthdays to be remembered, meetings to be arranged, favors to be returned, along with countless other duties and obligations. Given that demanding conditions are exceedingly common, it is important to understand how people can most effectively deal with such conditions. Unfortunately, psychological theories offer seemingly contradictory insights into this matter. Some influential theories propose that demanding conditions are likely to undermine self-regulation (Baumeister & Showers, 1986; Beilock, Kulp, Holt, & Carr, 2004; Deci & Ryan, 2000; Muraven & Baumeister, 2000). However, other theories suggest that demanding conditions lead people to marshal their self-regulatory resources, resulting in enhanced motivation and self-regulation (e.g., Botvinick, Braver, Barch, Carter, & Cohen, 2001; Brehm & Self, 1989; Trope & Fishbach, 2000). These different theories have very different practical implications. If demanding conditions undermine self-regulation, people will be best off by avoiding demanding conditions. By contrast, if demanding conditions facilitate selfregulation, people may be advised to seek out demanding conditions whenever they can. In the present article, we develop an integrative theoretical analysis of how demanding conditions influence self-regulation. In what follows, we begin by taking a closer look at the basic ways in which demanding conditions might help or hurt self-regulation. Next, drawing upon action control theory (Kuhl, 1984, 1994a), we propose that the self-regulatory impact of demanding conditions depends on people’s mode of adapting to these"

The modified version included two additional components: use of learning strategies and positive general feedback. It was hypothesized that students’ perceptions of how they use learning strategies taught by their physical education (PE) teachers and perceived positive general feedback would influence students’ intrinsic motivation, intentions, and physical activity behaviour in a leisure-time context through intrinsic motivation in PE. A structural equation model supported the hypotheses and demonstrated that the use of learning strategies and perceived positive general feedback in PE indirectly influenced intrinsic motivation in leisure time through the effect of intrinsic motivation in PE. There was a direct effect of perceived positive general feedback on physical activity behaviour as well as an indirect effect through the motivational sequence."

Saari \n Ulla Närhi \n Anna Karjalainen \n Kari Pylkkänen \n Marja Airaksinen \n J. Simon Bell \nAbstract Background People with depression commonly use the Internet to access antidepressant information, but the quality of this information is highly variable. The objective of this study was to assess how and why people use the Internet to access antidepressant information, and the self-reported impact of information obtained online. Methods Six focus groups were conducted with a cross-section of Internet users ( n  = 29) with depression. Focus group transcripts were thematically content analyzed using a constant comparison approach. Results Reasons cited for seeking online information included to obtain a second opinion, to verify information provided in the Package Information Leaflet, to prepare to visit to a physician, and to learn about peer experiences. The Internet was used to complement rather than replace information provided by health professionals. The self-reported impacts of utilizing online drug information included increased autonomy, improved knowledge, being reassured, deciding to change a dose, to discontinue a drug and to suggest a new drug to a physician. Limitations Additional quantitative research and a random sampling technique would be required to obtain generalizable results and to assess the relative importance of the various reasons cited by the focus group participants. Conclusions The Internet was perceived as an important source of additional drug information, particularly when fear of stigmatization or depression related symptoms limited information seeking from other sources. Health professionals should design online services and direct their clients to accurate and reliable sources of online drug information."

The Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC defines a data broadly to refer to the ‘natural or legal person, public authority, agency or any other body which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of processing are determined by national or Community laws or regulations, the controller or the specific criteria for his nomination may be designated by national or Community law.’ If the definition of the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC (DPD) is applied literally to social networking sites such as Facebook and MySpace, arguably, not only organisations such as FB and MySpace are regarded as data controllers (through Art. 4 of the DPD), but individuals who posted information about others (friends or work colleagues etc.) would also be regarded as data controllers and thus have to adhere to the legal rules laid down under the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC (ie. Art. 7 of the DPD fair and lawful processing; not excessive etc) unless it could be shown that the exemptions under Art. 9 that processing was intended for journalistic, artistic and literary purposes or that Art. 13 exceptions apply. As identified in an earlier paper, Art. 3.2 DPD (Wong and Savirimuthu, Art. 3(2) All or Nothing: This is the Question? The Application of Art. 3(2) Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC to the Internet) is unlikely to apply whereby processing was carried out for private and domestic purposes. This paper is an attempt to address a definitional difficulty that the legislatures did not anticipate. In attempting to protect the privacy of individuals, it is now possible to argue that it is becoming easier for individuals (and not merely organisations) to be brought within the scope of the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC in a social networking environment."

By examining both the legal and moral obligations of informed consent, it will be argued that “erring on the side of caution”, for instance by not publishing on the Internet because the consultants/community do not have exposure to such things, is just as paternalistic as assuming that they would consent if they understood. It is further argued that the researcher has an obligation to explain the research to the consultants/community as fully as possible and to engage in an ongoing negotiation of consent, but that the researcher must respect the autonomy of the consultant/community decision, even if the consent was not fully “informed”."

Coser’s ‘greedy institutions’ demand undivided time and loyalty from the individual who will voluntarily devote him/herself for exclusive benefi ts only granted to loyal followers. Although the ancient authorities have vanished—princes with their court Jews, masters with their servants, or religious and political missionar- ies—one can argue that the idea of the greedy institution is far from obsolete today. Management consultants, 24/7 old-age carers from Eastern Europe and particularly the ‘hive mind’ of new social media show that a revisiting of Coser’s theory can help in understanding modern forms of greed in institu- tions. This awareness may enhance vigilance against intrusions into personal autonomy."

These campaigns sought to influence journalists in direct and indirect ways, and planned their strategic communication efforts around political events such as debates well in advance. Despite these similarities, staffers cite that Obama’s campaign had much greater ability to respond in real time to unfolding commentary around political events given an organizational structure that provided digital staffers with a high degree of autonomy. After analyzing the ways staffers discuss effective communication on the platform, this article argues that at extraordinary moments campaigns can exercise what Isaac Reed calls “performative power,” influence over other actors’ definitions of the …"

Levine \nRegional autonomy and separatist movements severely test the conflict management capacities of a nation’s political system. Following Calhoun, a series of institutional arrangements and political practices which depart from majority rule decision making have been identified in the literature as contributing to the peaceful management of subcultural cleavages. Such arrangements provide minority subcultures with institutionalized means of self-protection and guarantees against stable unrepresentation and official cultural stigmatization. But, as Schattsneider pointed out, conflicts are best regulated before they start and institutional arrangements such as those above must be made before regional cleavages become too politicized. At a certain stage of conflict, peaceable partition may be the only solution. In Canada and the antebellum U.S., failure to set up formal modes of sectional self protection led to conflict regulation failure and the emergence of separatist movements in Quebec and the South.

The course, oriented to the use of Internet resources for language learning, was designed specifically to foster learner autonomy. Based on a previous exploratory study (Arno et al. 2003), this research seeks to refine the profile of the autonomous learner initially developed and to discover which specific actions and attitudes related to learner autonomy are found in students’ behaviour. Thus, combining qualitative and quantitative methods, we carried out an analysis of the autonomous behaviour displayed by students when using different Internet resources through activities designed to foster learner autonomy. This study has allowed us to outline the profile of autonomous learners in a virtual classroom, with students who are able to take the initiative and make decisions on the organization and management of their learning process. Focusing on the connection between making the most of the Internet and developing students’ autonomy, our ultimate aim is to point to ways in which students may be encouraged to become more autonomous and explore the role that the Internet may play in helping us attain this objective."

The first part of the study was a descriptive survey administered to a convenience sample of nurses (454 individuals) who worked in hospitals and other primary care clinics in the Principality of Asturias in northern Spain. The survey tested their knowledge of living wills and related major legal issues. At the end of the survey, the nurses were asked to provide a personal email address if they were interested in participating in a personal interview. In the second part of this study, we used a qualitative phenomenological approach based on Husserl’s framework. The results indicate that nurses are not sufficiently knowledgeable about the use of LWD in clinical practise. As a consequence, they are unable to support patient autonomy in health care treatment decisions."

However, since 2001 regulations have been relaxed to allow students to complete all course requirements for a university degree via online distance learning. This paper reports the results of a questionnaire study administered to the students (N=424) enrolled in one of Japan’s few online distance universities. Satisfaction with learning was explored by examining student opinions and learning preferences in regard to five aspects of distance learning identified as important: 1) teacher interaction, 2) content interaction, 3) student interaction, 4) computer interaction and 5) student autonomy. In addition, student responses to three open-ended questions were included in the analysis. The results indicated students were generally satisfied with their learning, and that specifically, learning satisfaction was higher for students who: 1) could persevere in the face of distance learning challenges, 2) found computers easy to use, 3) found it easy to interact with instructors, and 4) did not prefer social interaction with others when learning."

Although over the past 30 years, a large body of research has been carried on learner autonomy, limited attention has been paid to the sense teachers in comparison to learners would make of this concept. The present study is an attempt to shed light on the general existing pattern of the way teachers and learners view learner autonomy. To do so, applying the convenience method of sampling, a structured questionnaire consisting of five sections was emailed to most of the teachers teaching English as a foreign language in Isfahan, Iran. In order to have a more precise analysis, an interview was carried out to see what reasons are behind the participants’ answers. Employing the referential statistics, the results indicated that nearly all the teachers and learners agreed on the fact that learner autonomy allows language learners to learn more efficiently than they otherwise would. Furthermore, in relation to desirability and feasibility of learner autonomy, almost all the participants agreed that it is more desirable than feasible. The findings of this study might benefit those teachers and institution officials interested in enhancing learning autonomy among their students and even educating themselves or the other teachers to make use of it practically in classrooms."

Internet-based cognitive behavioural treatment (ICBT) has been suggested for use in primary care and has been shown to be more effective when combined with human support. However, non-completion rates remain a challenge. Current recommendations state that steps to improve persistence with ICBT should be determined and the impact of therapist support on persistence explored. A few earlier studies have explored motivations to persist with ICBT without face-to-face therapist support. The present study explored the motivation to persist as experienced by a group of patients who sought help in primary care and used “blended care”, i.e. ICBT supported by short face-to-face consultations. To elucidate motivation in an everyday context and the meaning of patients’ experiences we chose a phenomenological hermeneutical approach. We interviewed participants in the intervention group of a randomized controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy of an ICBT programme called MoodGYM, an eHealth intervention used to treat depression. Fourteen participants, both completers and non-completers, went through individual, semi-structured interviews after they ended their treatment. Hope of recovery and a desire to gain control of one’s life were identified as intrinsic motivators. The feeling of being able to freely choose how, when and where to complete the ICBT modules was identified as an important supporting condition and satisfied the participants’ need for autonomy. Furthermore, the importance of a sense of belonging towards partners, friends or family was essential for motivation as was the ability to identify with ICBT content. Another supporting condition was the experience of connectedness when met with acknowledgement, flexibility and feedback from a qualified therapist in the face-to-face consultations. A key finding was that participants were motivated to persist with ICBT when their overall need for relatedness was satisfied. This was achieved through a sense of belonging towards partners, friends and family. Connectedness with the therapist and the participant’s ability to identify with the ICBT modules also gave a sense of relatedness. Improving these motivational aspects may increase patients’ persistence with ICBT."

The steps of the project were the following: Firstly, the integration of computerized tools in the curriculum of the two university subjects. Secondly, the implementation of this learning experience was based on a corpus of selected texts which were annotated to help and guide students in their work (the World of Texts); and a database used by students to deal with lexical analysis and to record their findings and their knowledge about lexical items from the texts compiled (the Web of Words). By integrating ICT in the teaching process, we expected to foster students’ autonomy and motivation as well as to improve their lexical and semantic competence. The research results suggest that, in the first place, the computer-mediated format increased students’ motivation and encouraged autonomy in the learning process; in addition, it contributed to a better understanding of both subjects."

Such \n Agustin Espinosa \n Ana García-Fornes \nAbstract Privacy has been a concern for humans long before the explosive growth of the Internet. The advances in information technologies have further increased these concerns. This is because the increasing power and sophistication of computer applications offers both tremendous opportunities for individuals, but also significant threats to personal privacy. Autonomous agents and multi-agent systems are examples of the level of sophistication of computer applications. Autonomous agents usually encapsulate personal information describing their principals, and therefore they play a crucial role in preserving privacy. Moreover, autonomous agents themselves can be used to increase the privacy of computer applications by taking advantage of the intrinsic features they provide, such as artificial intelligence, pro-activeness, autonomy, and the like. This article introduces the problem of preserving privacy in computer applications and its relation to autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. It also surveys privacy-related studies in the field of multi-agent systems and identifies open challenges to be addressed by future research."

A limited number of experimental studies on this topic have shown mixed results. We carried out a randomized, controlled intervention study that aimed to examine the causal relationship between computer use and measures of physical well-being, social well-being, emotional well-being, development and activity, and autonomy. We randomly assigned a group of 191 participants to an intervention group, a training-no intervention group, or a no training-no intervention group. A fourth group consisted of 45 participants with no interest in computer use. We collected data at baseline, after 4 months, and after 12 months. The results showed that using computers and the Internet neither positively nor negatively influenced everyday functioning, well-being and mood, and the social network of healthy older individuals. We discuss possibilities for future studies."

For students to engage in higher order thinking, they first need to have autonomy over their learning processes. The focus of the paper is on how orienting activities support learner autonomy in the ICT-based learning environment. Taking the activity system as a unit of analysis, the study documents the actual processes by which orienting activities are planned and organized to support learner autonomy in their contexts.\nBy employing methods such as observations, focus group discussions with students, and face-to-face interviews with teachers, an account of how the activity systems within and between classrooms, and the schools are generated. The account identifies and describes five categories of orienting activities: introductory sessions to ICT tools, advance organizers and instructional objectives, worksheets and checklists, dialogues among participants, and tools for post-instructional reflection. It also highlights the constraints of time and lack of knowledge and experience in the contexts that the teachers are working under, and how these constraints are addressed."

Esch and C. Zahner argue that the learners themselves are the key agents in the construction of new language learning environments. Learners differ in their ability to import new elements – such as ICTs – into their model of what constitutes an appropriate language learning environment. It is argued that accessibility, autonomy, ‘reflectivity’ and interactivity are conditions which must be met if ICTs are to become truly relevant to language learners. The way these principles have been guiding the development of the network-based language learning environment installed by the Language Centre of the University of Cambridge is described."

In an effort to produce quality and independent learners, Learning Management Systems (LMS) are seen as a means to assist educators in developing quality online internet based courses and websites as well as to fulfil students’ needs in acquiring information anywhere and anytime. This paper explores the Malaysian perspective in addressing issues and challenges faced by adult learners in IHLs to keep abreast with this latest trend. This research paper is based on a pilot study that investigated learner autonomy via a distance learning programme in a local university in Malaysia. Initial findings indicated that first-year students lacked the confidence needed to learn autonomously. Even though they showed some confidence in planning, results indicated they needed help in organising, monitoring and evaluating their learning. If students are required to participate in asynchronous online learning, necessary steps have to be taken to ensure they are empowered with the necessary skills and tools to help them manage their own learning for their journey to become lifelong autonomous learners."

In this article, we test these criticisms by asking what effects the film had on college students’ perceptions of Africa and Africans. To address this question, we draw on a survey and an experiment conducted at a small liberal arts college where Kony 2012 enjoyed popularity. The results show that the film did affect students’ perceptions of Africa; specifically, it led many to perceive Africans as lacking agency and autonomy. We argue that whereas the film did have initial negative effects on students’ perceptions of Africa, these effects seem to fade over time. Future research should explore the compounding effects of exposure to images that misrepresent the African continent."

Grimmer \n Edward M. Kian \nThis article examines German print sport journalists’ perceptions, experiences, and relationships with Bundesliga clubs’ public relations (PR) staffers and each club’s designated press spokesperson, as well the impact of a competitive, multitier 21st-century media environment on their jobs. All Bundesliga clubs are now disseminating more multimedia content on their own through official Web sites and social media such as Twitter and Facebook. Meanwhile, the German newspaper industry is in a state of transformation and decreased prominence among mediums in German sport journalism. A survey of print journalists who cover Bundesliga clubs showed that these changes have affected the historic symbiotic relationship between the sporting press and Bundesliga clubs. Power and media autonomy have increased for Bundesliga clubs and their designated press spokespersons, while print reporters are more dependent on the clubs’ PR staffers to provide access. The surveyed journalists recognize the increasing power of television in German sport journalism, but nearly half do not consider this as negative for their jobs. These print sport journalists are called on to find new ways and types of media content to begin restoring the needed balance in a symbiotic relationship between independent press and PR, while also distinguishing their work from televised media content."

Undeniably, ownership rights were first applied to chattels and land and so we begin by considering the moral basis of these nghts. We then consider if these arguments make moral sense when they are extended to intellectual phenomenon. We identified two principal moral defenses: one based on utilitarian concerns relating to human welfare, the other appeals to issues of individual autonomy and private control. We conclude that intellectual property rights could not be defended from a moral perspective that emphasizes autonomy and individual control because copyright and patent restrict fundamental freedoms to transfer and redistribute one’s property. We also find it difficult to defend intellectual property in software from a utilitarian perspective because of the current structure of the market. We menH tion two characteristics of the software market that make it distinct and promote monopolistic conditions and excessive profit taking: the facility of replication, and the need for compatibility in operatirlg systems. We conclude that there are good reasons to reverse the current market’s structure. We suggest three possible remedies. The government could ngorously enforce antitrust legislation, impose greater monitoring and pnce controls, or obviate the commercial aspect altogether by denying the application of intellectual property rights to software."

Dennis Wei \n Felix Haifeng Liao \nThe embeddedness of transnational corporations (TNCs) in metropolitan economies has become a central issue in the research on globalization and local development. This paper attempts to enhance understanding of FDI embeddedness by assessing TNCs’ backward and technological linkages with domestic firms. Through a case study of the information and communication technology (ICT) industry in Suzhou, a frontier globalizing city in the Yangtze River Delta in China, it was found that strategic coupling between TNCs and domestic Chinese firms rarely exists and global production networks (GPN) have not brought substantial benefits to the development of domestic firms in the region. Regression analysis further reveals that TNCs’ backward and technological linkages with domestic firms are highly selective and contingent upon market potential in the host region, TNCs’ research and development (R&D) orientation and to a lesser extent subsidiary autonomy. It is also found that the booming and sizable domestic market and the development of domestic firms have potential to pave the way for upgrading. These findings suggest that there is a need to develop a broader conceptualization of the upgrading pathways of local firms beyond the notion of strategic coupling in the GPN perspective."

The project starts with the assumption that the faculty teaching with online labs and the faculty or academic departments that provide those labs are acting in two roles with different goals and concerns. The iLab architecture focuses on fast platform-independent lab development, scalable access for students, and efficient management for lab providers while preserving the autonomy of the faculty actually teaching the students. Over the past two years, the iLab architecture has been adopted by an increasing number of partner universities in Europe, Australia, Africa, Asia, and the United States.

Data that supports the paper have been obtained by surveying a representative sample of children in the Balearic Islands aged between 6 and 16 years; the analysis dimensions are: access by minors to the Internet from home; location of the computer from which have online access; level of autonomy or accompaniment while surfing the Net; norms imposed by their parents; types of rules imposed; relationship between norms and gender; the minors’ opinion and assessment of the knowledge and abilities of their parents on use of the Internet and, finally, the accompanying strategies of parents when their children access the Internet. The main results shows that just over 53% of minors between 6 and 14, and 62% of those between 15 and 16, surf the Internet without their parents’ presence and free of any norms and/or limitations. Where standards are established, these are mainly to do with temporary restrictions. Therefore, it appears that parents are unaware of the dangers of the Internet or at least act irrationally. This shows the need for awareness and provision of skills, knowledge and abilities to enable parents to assume their responsibilities in the Internet usage of minors."

The data was collected from 322 female collegestudents and analyzed with a t-test and multiple regression using the SPSS 21.0 program. The significant factors of sexual autonomy were intercourse experience (β=0.115, p=.040), sex knowledge (β=0.118, p=.028), permissiveness ofsexual violence (β=-0.290, p<.001), and the perception of unwed pregnancy (β=-0.104, p=.048). These factors explained 21.7% of the variance in sexual autonomy. In conclusion, there is a need to develop a sex education program to increase sexual autonomy considering the factors affecting sexual autonomy.

Thus, practitioners are interested in how to support people’s motivation to produce UGC. While previous literature has examined various factors influencing people’s motivation to produce UGC, few studies have examined the role of other participants as well as the social media sites. Based on self-determination theory, our study examines the relationship between content attractiveness, trust, perceived competence and autonomy, individual differences, and motivation to produce UGC. Using social network sites as the context of our study, we tested our hypotheses with U.S. college students, and the results supported our hypotheses. We contribute to the current literature by demonstrating that, when individuals perceive that other participants enjoy their UGC and trust social media sites, the individuals’ perceived competence and autonomy are enhanced, which in turn supports their motivation to produce UGC."

Social media is integrated in schools and higher learning institutions for communication and reflection of learning which enhance teachers’ performance in leadership quality and effective teaching. This study was designed in a qualitative approach mainly to explore the extent of interest and enjoyment students experienced during an intensive ICT course. Blog was used as a medium for reflection during the class where students posted their creations of videos, posters and other ICT materials. The three needs investigated were namely autonomy, competence, and relatedness support. The researcher further examined on students’ awareness of the usefulness of the ICT skill they learned and how much they can use the blog for teaching and learning. Based on the Basic Psychological Needs Theory framework (BPNT), this study has adopted the direct observation, journal entry, and interviews as a triangulation approach."

    "text": "Doc 489 :  Organising Co-Existence in Cyberspace: Content Regulation and Privacy Compared \nhttps://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.325360\n Christoph Engel \nThe Internet globalizes the world. National regulatory autonomy shrinks. Transferring data from one country to another is almost costless. Foreign content is just a click away. Why is it that states have been able to re-install co-existence in some policy areas, and not in others? In data protection, the safe-harbour compromise between the US and the EU found a way out. In the area of content regulation, transnational conflict is no less pronounced. The Europeans are preoccupied with Nazi publications, that are constitutionally protected in the US. The US public dislikes portrayals of nudity, that most Europeans find inoffensive. Yet no attempts at organizing co-existence are within sight. This paper develops a rational choice model to explain the difference. States are modelled as actors. The good is the degree of protection accorded to a value. Nations evaluate such protection differently. Moreover, rational nations are aware of the opportunity cost involved in any activity to protect local values. To a degree, the inability of organizing co-existence stems from a difference in preferences. If so, there is no room for a win-win solution. But typically, one nation does not positively want some content to be accessible that the other nation dislikes fervently. Usually, the first nation is just indifferent, or the opportunity cost seems too high. The more important difference between data protection and content regulation thus turns out to be strategic. Organizing co-existence in both areas presupposes overcoming a strategic conflict. But in data protection, this typically is a one-to-one conflict, while in content regulation the typical conflict is of a one-to-many nature. In public goods terminology, co-existence is a weaker-link good with a very high threshold. This difference might make it advisable for countries with a strong preference for protection to shift from mitigation to adaptation. Practically speaking, they would push, perhaps even subsidize, the development of powerful filtering technologies. And they would strengthen their social norms ostracizing access to outrageous content."

We derive a simple agency model of the interaction between a local branch manager and the headquarters, which yields an estimable equation for the optimal delegation of authority. Using a unique and specifically tailored dataset including about 300 Italian banks, we show that banks equipped with more ICT capital and resorting to credit scoring delegate more decision-making power to their local branch managers. These results are robust to many additional controls, including instrumental variable estimation. The effects on decentralization are strengthened for those banks that jointly hold higher ICT capital endowments and adopt credit scoring."

Mobile-phone based assessment may be one method of facilitating clinically- and cost-effective intervention, and increasing the autonomy and independence of service users. Recently, text-message and smartphone interfaces have been developed for the real-time assessment of symptoms in individuals with schizophrenia. Little is currently understood about patients’ perceptions of these systems, and how they might be implemented into their everyday routine and clinical care."

Second, we turn to a social movement that is by definition less traditional and less established, namely neo-paganism; and finally, we examine the new phenomenon of hyper-real religion (Possamai 2005b, 2012) to discover whether, even in free-floating religions where in principle everything is permitted and where the individual has full autonomy to decide on the specific constructions of his/her religion, forms of authority and social/religious distinctions are paradoxically present."

Performance management is specifically challenging for organizations employing skilled professionals, such as physicians, due to the complexity in defining performance and to the autonomy that professionals enjoy. Professionalism of employees implies that supervisors cannot evaluate adequately their subordinates’ performance and, thus, alternative assessment systems are necessary. This explains why in health care schemes such as 360-degree feedback and peer review are increasingly used. We define these alternative assessment systems as “non-hierarchical performance assessment” and report exploratory data from an Internet search of performance assessment Information Technology (IT) solutions offered by IT providers. We use a classification of these IT solutions in order to identify and discuss new ways for assessing and for developing professionals in health care. We conclude by discussing differences and similarities between 360-degree feedback and peer review and by identifying current trends and possible future developments about how IT enables new assessment systems in this industry."

It then measures this position against the findings of social science research studies that have examined the behaviour of young people in online spaces. The author argues that the legal test being advanced by the Court is out of step with what we know about people’s online experiences and expectations. As such, the test may limit the Court’s ability to protect us from surveillance technologies that negatively affect our dignity, autonomy, and social freedom. Especially as more of our public and private lives migrate to virtual spaces, it is essential that the courts begin to pay attention to the lessons to be gleaned from the social sciences research on privacy and reinvigorate the legal protection of privacy as a social value."

Saracchini \n Carlos Alberto Catalina Ortega \n Luca Bordoni \nModern technology offers many facilities, but elderly people are often unable to enjoy them fully because they feel discouraged or intimidated by modern devices, and hus become progressively isolated in a society where Internet communication and ICT knowledge are essential. In this paper we present a study performed during the Nacodeal Project, which aims to offer a technological solution that may improve elderly people’s every day autonomy and life quality through the integration of ICTs. In order to achieve this goal, state-of-art Augmented Reality technology was developed along with carefully designed Internet services and interfaces for mobile devices. Such technology only requires the infrastructure which already exists in most residences and health-care centres. We present the design of a prototypical system consisting of a tablet and a wearable AR system, and the evaluation of its impact on the social interaction of its users as well its acceptance and usability. This evaluation was performed, through focus groups and individual pilot tests, on 48 participants that included elderly people, caregivers and experts. Their feedback leads us to the conclusion that there are significant benefits to be gained and much interest among the elderly in assistive AR-based ICTs, particularly in relation to the communication and autonomy that they may provide."

Ryan \nPro-social behaviors have been associated with enhanced well-being, but what psychological mechanisms explain this connection? Some theories suggest that beneficence-the sense of being able to give-inherently improves well-being, whereas evidence from self-determination theory (Weinstein & Ryan, 2010) shows that increases in well-being are mediated by satisfaction of innate psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Here we simultaneously assess these two explanations. Study 1 (N = 335) used a cross-sectional survey with an Internet sample to develop a measure to assess beneficence satisfaction. The next two cross-sectional Internet-sample studies tested mediators between pro-social behavior and general well-being (Study 2, N = 332) and situational peak moment well-being (Study 3, N = 180). A fourth study (N = 85) used a diary method with university students to assess daily fluctuations in well-being associated with needs and beneficence. It was shown across all studies that both the three psychological needs and beneficence satisfaction mediate the relations between pro-social actions and well-being, with all four factors emerging as independent predictors. Together, these studies underscore the role of autonomy, competence, and relatedness in explaining the well-being benefits of benevolence, and they also point to the independent role of beneficence as a source of human wellness."

    "text": "Doc 497 :  How Consumerist Do People Want to Be? Preferred Role in Decision-Making of Individuals with HIV/AIDS \nhttps://doi.org/10.12927/hcpol.2008.19559\n Sara Urowitz \n Raisa B. Deber \nWhat role do patients want to play in treatment decision-making? The new physician–patient relationship is popularly characterized in the language of consumerism; some speak of the “new patients,” armed with reams of Internet printouts, telling their doctors how they wish to be treated (Eysenbach and Jadad 2001; Haugh 1999). This emphasis is supported by medical ethics, which has long stressed respecting patient autonomy (Beauchamp and Childress 2001; Katz 1984; President’s Commission 1982); by legal standards requiring informed consent (Caulfield 2004; Etchells et al. 1996; Rozovsky 1997); and by the consumer movement, which encourages patient empowerment, medical consumerism and informed choice (Epstein 1996; Haug and Lavin 1983; Lupton 1997; Williamson 1992; Wood 2000). However, many providers continue to argue that this portrait does not depict the patients they see, that consumerist expectations are unrealistic and that their patients do not wish to be autonomous decision-makers.\nA growing body of literature on shared decision-making (Charles et al. 1997; Coulter 2002; Coulter and Rozansky 2004; Deyo 2001; Frosch and Kaplan 1999; Kaplan 1999; McNutt 2004; Sevdalis and Harvey 2006) emphasizes the importance of partnership between providers and patients. Deber and colleagues (Deber 1994; Deber and Baumann 1992; Deber et al. 1996) further defined “preferred” role by distinguishing between two dimensions of “participation,” which they termed “problem-solving” (PS) and “decision-making” (DM). PS tasks have “right” and “wrong” answers, determination of which often requires expertise, whereas DM tasks incorporate both factual knowledge and individual preferences. These authors’ research confirmed that few care recipients in the populations they studied wished to assume responsibility for PS, although many did wish involvement in DM (Deber and Sharpe 1999; Deber et al. 1996; Kraetschmer et al. 2004; Stewart et al. 2001; Deber et al. 2007).\nWe accordingly surveyed people living with HIV/AIDS (PHAs), a population widely believed to be both highly knowledgeable about their disease and more actively involved in making treatment decisions (Epstein 1996; Furin 1997) and hence relatively likely to wish to assume an autonomous role. Indeed, in the early days of the epidemic, researchers found that many PHAs distrusted organized medicine. These attitudes were said to be fuelled by a combination of radical AIDS activism, reactions to perceptions of homophobia among healthcare providers (Douglas et al. 1985; Epstein 1996; O’Hare et al. 1996) and recognition of the limited ability of the medical establishment to deal effectively with this new disease (Epstein 1996). Consequently, many PHAs became experts in the disease and its treatment, attending conferences, presenting to peers, participating on pharmaceutical, government, policy and research advisory boards, and institutionalizing these efforts through AIDS service organizations (ASOs) (Kayal 1993).\nThis history suggests that PHAs are more likely than most care recipients to have relatively strong consumerist tendencies related to making their own healthcare choices. We asked PHAs about their preferences for involvement in treatment decision-making, their level of satisfaction with their current role in treatment decision-making, their trust in organized medicine and their use and views of a series of potential information sources."

We do so because many of the contemporary discussions regarding work and organization are usually, and too often implicitly, drawing on rudimentary understandings of these concepts. Our focus here is to advance beyond simplistic articulations and to provide a more conceptually sound approach to address time, space and the uses of information and communication technologies in work. We do this focusing on temporal and spatial relations as a means to depict time and space at work. We characterize work as varying by two characteristics: the degree of interaction and the level of individual autonomy. We then develop a functional view of information and communication technologies relative to their uses for production, control, coordination, access and enjoyment. We conclude by integrating these concepts into an initial framework which allows us to theorize that new forms of work are moving towards four distinct forms of organizing. We further argue that each of these four forms has particular spatial and temporal characteristics that have distinct and different needs for information and communication technologies."

Wilson \n Enrique García Bengoechea \nThe purpose of this study was to test the structural and criterion validity of scores derived from the Relatedness to Others in Physical Activity Scale (ROPAS). The participants (n1 = 893; n2 = 522) completed the ROPAS in addition to demographic questions (study 1) and well-being indicators (study 2) using cross-sectional, nonexperimental surveys. Confirmatory factor analysis (study 1) supported the tenability of a 6-item ROPAS measurement model that was invariant across gender. Higher ROPAS scores were associated with greater perceived autonomy and competence and greater well-being (study 2). Overall, these findings suggested the ROPAS displays a number of psychometric properties that render the instrument useful for investigating issues of belonging and connectedness with others in global physical activity settings. jabr_ 61..87 Self-determination theory (SDT; Deci & Ryan, 2002) has become a popular framework for understanding motivational issues in physical activity contexts such as sport and exercise (Hagger & Chatzisarantis, 2007). This is not surprising given the macro-level approach taken within SDT that specifies the nature and function of human motivation as well as the conditions that facilitate (or thwart) motivational development and enhance well-being (Deci & Ryan). The approach embraced within SDT centers around an “organismic-dialectic” (Deci & Ryan, p. 5), which assumes that humans are active growth-orientated organisms who seek out opportunities for assimilation within their social world. The development of human potentials central to SDT does not occur in a social vacuum but relies on ambient supports that interface with the organism’s innate tendencies to optimize motivation and promote greater well-being (Deci & Ryan). The concept of basic psychological needs is central to Deci and Ryan’s (2002) meta-theory and is formally explicated within Basic Psychological Needs Theory (BPNT). Deci and Ryan extolled the importance of feeling competent,"

In a way it provides a test bench for many ideas which policy makers are trying to introduce in many other systems. It is therefore interesting to consider it, in order to gain a broader perspective from which to frame Italian school autonomy. This paper focuses on the complex scenario of English educational accountability, one which attracts the interest of researchers from all over the world and originates a continuous debate among practitioners, researchers and policy makers. The broad literature concerning English educational accountability makes available a variety of interpretations, reflections and points of view. The paper intends to consider this scenario mainly from the perspective of English headteachers. The objects of the analysis are the voices of headteachers and policy advisers, collected through interviews where they have been asked to report on their experiences and perceptions or, in the case of policy advisers, to put themselves in the headteachers’ shoes. It is argued that while policy makers from many countries look at the English accountability framework with interest, ready to borrow hints and tools from the orderly atmosphere of regulation it performs, English educational professionals experience strong contradictions and struggle with the hardness and the sharpness of the system.

To facilitate ebbs and flows of maintaining a mobile global workforce, the literature suggests that engineering education should promote methodology and learning mechanisms that personalize accountability of mobile learners’ content knowledge across jurisdictions. In addition, data from the literature shows that mobile or cyber-learning is generating massive amounts of data which could inform engineering educators in their response to a mobile and constantly changing workforce. This paper reviews data from a pilot study of Technology-Enhanced Autonomous Learning Environment (TEALE). TEALE is a framework for mobile learning environments that afford accountability of personalized evidence-based content across learning jurisdictions. Prelimary data from this third pilot report suggests that TEALE promotes accountability of content knowledge across learning jurisdictions: both among formal disciplines in the academy, as well as between the academy, informal learning and workplace requirements. However, the data also suggests that seamless mobility across these academic and social jurisdictions involves issues far beyond technology. These issues, which include adjudicating relevance and value among academic cultures, incentives for motivation, authority and autonomy should be accounted for when using TEALE. Attention to these issues could prevent engineering educators from viewing potential opportunities for inter-jurisdictional collaborations as encroachments and avert the specter of unintended social-dramas."

This law requires local governments to organize and manage the potential that exists in the region. One of the potential tourism that Batang regency has is Pagilaran. Besides that, the purpose of such cooperation is to realize good governance in Batang. This study was conducted to describe the patterns of cooperation in managing Pagilaran between PT Pagilaran and the Department of Culture and Tourism in Batang Regency. It also explains about the difficulties in such cooperation. This study used qualitative research methods. Data triangulation technique is also used to obtain more accurate data validity. Sources of primary data obtained through interviews with relevant informants and secondary data obtained from documents, records, internet, and other sources which are related to this research. This study was conducted in Pagilaran Tourism Object. Results of this study illustrate a pattern of cooperation in managing Pagilaran. The patterns of cooperation not only done by the government and private sector but also community had. Community was given a role to managing Pagilaran. Community had opportunity to participate in managing Pagilaran which is helping the government to achieve a good governance in Batang Regency and in this case, community participate in public services in the tourism sector. Good cooperation indicators was taken from the efficiency and quality, organization dynamics, effectiveness, and also share risks and benefits. In this study, three of the four indicators which are the efficiency and quality, organizational dynamics, share risks and benefits have been implemented properly. The effectiveness indicator has not done well yet because the government has not implement the obligation yet to take care the facilities that have been agreed in advance. In addition, results also explain the difficulties that exist in this cooperation. Recommendation can be given for stakeholders to coordinate better so that the management of Pagilaran can evolve in the future. Also expected to every party to comply the obligations which have been agreed by both parties in advance. Keywords: Regional Autonomy, Cooperation, Good Governance, Tourism"

Simmons \nThe purpose of this study was to identify the effects of Internet filtering and restricted Internet access in a school system and its effects on teaching and learning. A total of 120 middle and high school teachers and support and administrative staff completed a questionnaire with 14 Likert-type items and one openended response question about their perceptions of Internet filtering in their school. A chi-square test between middle and high school respondents revealed no significant differences. The majority (N=87) reported they accessed the Internet on a daily basis. Nearly all agreed that technology support was available (N=118), but 117 respondents felt legitimate sites had been blocked. Although user agreements were in place, results indicated that some felt students were not always punished for downloading offensive material. Some admitted they themselves used techniques to get around the filter or block to complete their tasks. A majority of the respondents reported e-mail as a critical function. Most felt the restrictions imposed in this county school system were designed to be more of a ban on Internet access. Teachers who used the Internet to develop lesson plans must show how the web sites will be used to support the lesson, and get approval to access the Internet. Sites must be bookmarked for the students’ use, and teachers are responsible for students accessing only those pre-approved sites. Frequent comments regarded the “filtering” system as essentially a block that: hampered their duties, created an inconvenience, reduced student autonomy, lowered morale, and decreased the likelihood they would create lessons integrating"

We draw on a longitudinal case study of a Belgian biopharmaceutical company to show how technical and professional teleworkers developed broadly similar strategies of spatiotemporal scaling to cope with this tension. We conclude by considering how these scaling strategies allowed employees to cope with the demands of ‘hybrid’ work that is conducted both at home and in traditional settings."

An Interpretive Study from the Consumers’ Perspective Jyvaskyla: University of Jyvaskyla, 2010, 186 p. (Jyvaskyla Studies in Business and Economics ISSN 1457-1986; 97) ISBN 978-951-39-4077-5 (PDF), 978-951-39-4073-7 (nid.) Diss. Finnish summary The purpose of this interpretive study was to investigate how consumers participate in co-creation of value in advertising and what the dimensions of value were. The motivation arose from the growing centrality of consumers as “production partners”; the growing centrality of advertising value; the growth of experiential and visual consumption; and the growth of social media. Advertising was conceived as experiential media products to be consumed. Empirical material consisted of consumer focus group discussions and interviews about advertising. The study involved 31 females. The empirical material was first categorized by qualitative content analysis following which it was analyzed using hermeneutical interpretation. The theoretical constructs of the consumer co-production model and aspects of consumer value provided the basis for interpretation. The consumers engaged in the co-production process in three different ways and experienced value in several ways. The first type was mixing, matching and blending in window-shopping, highlighting as value the females’ sense of autonomy: a feeling of independence and freedom of choice and a feeling of being up-to-date. Second, the goal-oriented journey generated: a feeling of empowerment; learning experiences; an increase in consumers’ cumulative product knowledge; and economic value. The third type was daydreaming and fantasizing that elicited feelings such as excitement, fun and pleasure as value. As the theoretical contribution a refined model of consumer co-production process in advertising is proposed. The model constitutes a new consumercentred, hierarchy-free model of advertising. Value is the consumer’s subjective experience based on the experience of co-creation itself and the consumer’s customized meanings of advertising. The practical implications were also proposed."

A two-stage modified nominal group study was conducted. At first, the main ques tion of the study was presented to 24 dental specialists through direct interview (16) or e-mail (8, response rate was 75%). After analyzing the interview transcripts and email responses, a list of issues was extracted. The list was presented to a nominal group of 10 dental specialists to prioritize ethical issues according to their frequency and ethical signifi cance. Each participant selected and ranked the five most important is sues and then, the sum of ranks for each issue was calculated. The first stage of the study resulted in a list of 26 ethical issues. After grouping and combining related items, the list was condensed into 18 issues. The nominal group session resulted in a prioritised list. The first six issues of the list included: performing procedures without adequate competency, not taking responsibility for one’s errors, over-treatment (or unnecessary treatment), inappropriate manners towards patients, unprofessional discussion of a colleague’s work, and unprincipled behaviors towards disadvantaged patients. Conclusions: The results suggest that the problems occurring in the therapeutic relationship between dentists and their patients are the major ethical issues of dentistry in Iran. Issues such as respecting patient’s autonomy, confidentiality, taking informed consent, third-party issues, and dentists’ duties toward society don’t seem to be considered of high priority by dentists in Iran as a developing country."

Hildreth \n Michael E. D. Koenig \nThis research includes both a descriptive and an exploratory study of seventeen library and information science (LIS) education academic units or programs that have been involved in mergers or administrative realignments that have positioned them in new organizational homes between the years 1982-2001. These LIS schools have been subject to a process that has moved them, willingly or not, from a status of relative independence and autonomy (and in many cases, cultural isolation), to that of partners in new alliances, or protected adoptees in new administrative and organizational homes. The authors wished to discover what took place, and learn of the conditions surrounding the merger or repositioning of the schools. We also wished to explore why these changes were implemented and to learn as much as possible about the outcomes of these developments. For the descriptive part of the study we relied on available documentation, often online, and telephone interviews with key participants in the mergers. Deans, directors, and senior faculty members were selected as a purposive sample for the exploratory, qualitative part of this study. A questionnaire consisting of twenty-three, mostly open-ended, questions was administered in telephone interviews. A follow-up brief questionnaire on specific outcomes was administered by email to the participants in the study. What we learned about the rationales, responses to, and outcomes of these mergers and realignments is reported here. While such mergers and relocations have been successful so far as survival strategies, many of the anticipated benefits have yet to be realized."

The development of information technologies is already influencing all spheres of human life. Nowadays, computers are used in learning and teaching foreign languages, as well as the education of other disciplines. The new technologies help students go into an active learning process. When it is thought in terms of the learner, it provides learning autonomy for the person. The learner can reach a linguistic competence in a shorter time by reaching several visual and auditory texts in foreign language, increasing his/her vocabulary knowledge, doing very productive grammar exercises in an interactively way, seeing the pronunciation of a word and the usage of it in a sentence, benefiting from translating programs, finding a chat friend to improve his/her communication ability, reaching the academic journals in the libraries ,reading and listening to the news in foreign language. In the Southern region of Albania this process has not been completely successful. DOI: 10.5901/mjss.2015.v6n6s2p93"

The Influence of Diversity Factors on Motives to use Communities in Professional Settings \nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2015.07.293\n Anne Katrin Schaar \n André Calero Valdez \n Martina Ziefle \nThe professional use and implementation of social media or social media related applications are booming. Solutions like business internal communities promise to connect employees in a more flexible way than old-fashioned mailing lists or static network drives ever could. New solutions are perceived to support communication independent from time and space and in allow a more flexible way of communicating direct as well as indirect through the offer of different communication media (chat, voice over IP, mail, blog, etc.). But in contrast to remarkably good application scenarios, reality is not keeping up. Therefore more investigations of usage conditions and acceptance parameters are needed to find out which showstoppers interfere with a successful implementation. Due to the fact that acceptance by future users is one core condition for a successful implementation of software within operational structures and processes, this paper presents a study with focus on motivational issues to use business communities depending on diversity factors. In this study the focus is set on the diversity factors age, gender, social media expertise, achievement motivation, and perceived locus of control over technology (ploc). First results revealed that the classical user diversity variables age and gender do not influence the motives to use business communities. In contrast technology related diversity factors and achievement motivation revealed correlations with usage motives (r > .3). The most important motives were the need for information and autonomy. Achievement motivation showed the strongest correlation with the need for social interaction (r = .51), indicating that highly motivated people can be motivated to use a SNS if it facilitates social interaction."

Both learners and professors are exposed to the Internet daily, so they can take advantage of it to teach and learn a foreign language. For this reason, it has become necessary to find ways to blend technology with language instruction.

Email: glukist@mail.ru Using archival and legislative sources, the authors reconstruct template documents, rate of document flow and features of document management in Russian universities of the first half of the 19th century. Document management is regarded as an administrative practice allowing the Ministry to inculcate bureaucratic values and an ethos of serving the government in professor, making them renounce their administrative autonomy.Being engaged in bureaucratic re-arrangement of reality, Russian professors very soon embarked on paperwork, which boosted the document flow in universities. The large scale of this behavior model indicates that a new type of university culture was born. Bureaucratic management of universities in the Russian Empire was different from that in Western countries in that it aimed to make the document flow uniform with other public institutions and to develop uniform rules and formal language. As a result, professors gradually lost the opportunity to express their own opinions and to take initiative in communicating with the government. The authors emphasize the subordinate nature of activities performed by professors to satisfy relevant governmental demands, which suggested that professors assisted in opening new schools, controlled existing ones, eradicated prejudice, obtained primary data on imperial regions and resources (topographic, meteorological, ethnographic, and economic data), and disseminated Western scientific ideas and knowledge in regional culture. An analysis of document management in Russian universities of the first half of the 19th century has shown that they were part of the administrative structure at that time, which diminished their status significantly, as compared to Western universities."

This holds important reflections in the realm of language learning, as well as in many other areas. This study aimed to explore the extent to which English Language Teaching (ELT) students utilise smartphones for language learning purposes. To this end, a 25-item questionnaire was administered to 120 Grade Three and Four ELT students at Ondokuz Mayis University in Turkey. Following the questionnaire, a follow-up oral interview was conducted with 29 of the participants on a voluntary basis in order to further investigate their perceptions of smartphones. The statistical analysis of the participants’ responses to the items in the questionnaire clearly shows that smartphones are actively used for language learning purposes. In particular, their contribution to the development of vocabulary skills is frequently reported, which is also verified by the answers given during the interview. The analysis regarding the ‘gender’ and ‘length of the students’ possession of a smartphone’ variables does not yield any statistically significant effect on the degree to which students utilise smartphones for language learning purposes. Given the fact that almost all students have a personal smartphone, and use it very often, and considering the findings of this study, it is suggested that students be encouraged to utilise the invaluable language learning opportunities offered by smartphones when put to conscious use.

The student-centered and constructivist learning environments which enable students to gain a significant understanding through their own efforts has grown in importance compared with the traditional learning environment based on the transfer of learning by teachers (Oguz, 2013). In the context of the constructivist approach, students create their own knowledge by actively participating in the learning process (Wang, 2011), and by giving importance to the learners’ autonomy. In these environments of interaction, the teacher becomes the learning facilitator, planning tasks and supporting responsibility for learning (Koc, 2006), providing students with options, helping them make their own decisions and solve problems for themselves. Consequently, this new focus provides students with opportunities to ask their own questions, and create their own learning concepts and strategies based on existing knowledge. The teacher has to accept students’ autonomy and their enterprising spirit, and support them in this sense. In the context of this constructivist focus, one of the the main objectives of education is to promote students’ autonomy (Ozturk, 2011).

    "text": "Doc 516 :  The Cloud: Boundless Digital Potential or Enclosure 3.0? \nhttps://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2077742\n David Lametti \nThe Cloud presents enormous potential for users to have access to facilities such as vast data storage and infinite computing capacity. Yet the Cloud, taken from the perspective of the average user, does have a dark side. I agree with a number of writers and the concerns that they raise about privacy and personal autonomy on the internet and the Cloud. However, I wish to voice concern over another change. From the perspective of users, the Cloud might also reduce the range of user possibilities for robust interaction with the internet/Cloud in a manner which then prevents users from participating in the internet as creators, collaborators, and sharers. The Cloud is “manageable” in a way the internet was not, and with users increasingly interacting with the internet with relatively less powerful devices than computers – smartphones, tablets and the like – this ability for Cloud service providers to control or manage users is enhanced. We owe the vocabulary of “enclosure” to Hungarian-Canadian political economist Karl Polanyi. In his seminal work, The Great Transformation, Polanyi described the enclosure movement in England in which communally integrated and collective farming practices on common lands were suppressed by authorities of the state, forcefully and sometimes brutally, in order to privatize land resources and create the conditions for a market economy in both agriculture as well as other sectors. More recently, the term “enclosure” has been used effectively by American intellectual property scholars such as James Boyle to describe the manner in which intellectual property rules and the concurrent practices of IP rights holders (for copyright, often large corporate interests) in the age of the internet were being used to restrict access to the public domain of ideas or the information commons.I argue that the Cloud, unless monitored and possibly directed, has the potential to go beyond undermining copyright and the public domain – Enclosure 2.0 – and to go beyond weakening privacy. This round, which I call “Enclosure 3.0”, has the potential to disempower internet users and conversely empower a very small group of gatekeepers. Put bluntly, it has the potential to relegate internet users to the status of digital sheep.By focusing on the entities that provide Cloud services, I argue that we might take steps to encourage or, if necessary, force private entities to keep the Cloud open and accessible in the long term. I also posit the desirability of a publicly-held Cloud to achieve this same end."

    "text": "Doc 517 :  Building Computer Games as Effective Learning Tools for Digital Natives - and Similars \nhttps://doi.org/10.28945/1406\n Ismar Frango Silveira \n Carlos Fernando de Araújo \n Jaime Sandro da Veiga \n Luis Naito Mendes Bezerra \n Leonardo Carlos Comotti Kasperavicius \nIntroduction Several authors discuss the use of digital games as effective learning tools. Aguilera and Mendiz (2003) and Gee (2003) bring extensive discussions–and seminal works–on the topic, as Bransford et al. (2000) and Prensky (2001) have done before. The role of digital games in these processes is being explored in the scientific literature for some time already, as evidenced by the work of Squire (2002). All these authors discuss computer games, as possessors of an attractive addition with strong appeal to motivate children and adults, could amplify the power of exploration and imagination of students, providing moments of research, reflection and learning. Nowadays, more recent discussions bring to light the need for narrative games and applications directed to specific areas such as education in Health Sciences (Tashiro, 2009), Engineering (Mayo, 2007) and Computer Sciences (Mustaro, Silva, & Silveira, 2008), for instance. Studies on contemporary culture, such as Johnson (2005), lead to the need to address further and specifically on the impact of the games in the education of a young of digital natives appropriating the term coined by Prensky (2001). Tapscott (1998) uses the nomenclature net generation to describe this generation, characterized by a high degree of autonomy, intellectual openness, inclusion, technology, freedom of expression, curiosity, short-termism and especially confidence. Shaffer (2007) highlights the use of computer games as effective for children’s learning, while Prensky (2007) presents a broader approach, examining the impact of digital games in educational processes in general. Mustaro et al. (2008) argue that this scenario fully justifies even andragogical proposals focused on games, since it is possible to take advantage of nowadays’ technological culture to subsidize the construction of learning resources for both formal education and for situations of non-formal learning, for both digital natives and older students that are immersed into (or are strongly influenced by) a culture with a pervasive presence of technology. The main point behind all these works could be resumed as: the content carried both in formal and non-formal education present some structural problems. Some of them are listed below: * Content (usually in formal education) have a degree of abstraction that often prevents efficient learning when teaching strategies are used that put students under the condition of passive learners. * Some learning situations require students to spend huge mental efforts to memorize large amount of information and procedures. This situation occurs equally in formal and non-formal education, being more common in certain knowledge fields than others. * Presentation of the content in face-to-face education sometime lacks from real-world examples of application of such content. This is more usual in theoretical subjects than hands-on ones. * Even in practical learning situations, the subject being taught could carry a very high complexity, given the amount of variables involved in real-world experiences. Physics labs and field experiences are good examples of it. These are situations where real conditions do not help the learning process–the world could be not so real in these cases. In all these contexts, the application of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in learning and teaching situations could allow new perspectives on various aspects ranging from content organization to a wide range of new opportunities promoted by the effective incorporation of technology into the entire teaching-learning process. At this point, the concept of Learning Objects (Wiley, 2000) is fundamental for the development of digital educational resources for use both in experimental and large-scale projects involving a massive number of students and disciplines in formal education. …"

Digital technologies are increasingly an integral part of children’s everyday lives and, therefore, valuable tools for supporting social inclusion. This paper discusses how digital technologies might positively support autonomy, engagement and decision-making through the lens of informed consent practices within social research. Current research practices are dominated by paper-based methods for obtaining informed consent which could be exclusionary for children and young people generally, and children with additional learning and support needs in particular. Digital technologies (laptops, PCs, tablet devices, smartphones) offer the potential to support accessibility and understanding of ideas and activities, as well as engagement with and autonomy in decision-making and participation. This paper explores this potential as well as the challenges that researchers may face in this context."

Finland - 2872/02), the European Court of Human Rights was confronted with the case of a boy whose photo had been posted on the internet and used for a sexual advertisement by a third person without knowledge or consent. The service provider denied the police access feeling itself bound to national rules of data protection. The ECHR, finally, held that under Art. 8 of the Convention, the right to privacy and family life, Finland was obliged to identify and sanction the wrongdoer. The decision refers to different problems that are regularly addressed under the heading of human dignity: sexual autonomy and communicative privacy. The case will serve as an example for three conceptual conflicts in the notion of human dignity: The conflict between a sphere of protected privacy and the development of a social personality, the conflict between individual autonomy and the protection by public authorities, and the conflict between general normative demands and case specific criteria. While human dignity might be a useful theoretical concept to depict these conflicts it cannot provide criteria to solve them."

The 20-week intervention was guided by self-determination theory and involved: professional development for teachers, provision of fitness equipment to schools, enhanced school sport sessions, researcher-led seminars, a smartphone application, and parental strategies for reducing screen time. Assessments were conducted at baseline and immediately post intervention (8 months). Psychological well-being was measured using the Flourishing Scale. Motivational regulations (intrinsic, identified, introjected, controlled, and amotivation) and basic psychological needs (autonomy, competence, and relatedness) in school sport, muscular fitness, resistance training skill competency, and recreational screen time were examined as potential mediating mechanisms of the intervention effect.The intervention effect on well-being was small but statistically significant. Within a multiple mediator model, changes in autonomy needs satisfaction, recreational screen time, and muscular fitness significantly mediated the effect of the intervention on psychological well-being.In addition to the physical health benefits, targeted physical activity programs for adolescent boys may have utility for mental health promotion through the mechanisms of increasing autonomy support and muscular fitness and reducing screen time."

Special attention is paid to examining whether the strength of the association with new work practices is the same for the two technologies. The data used in the empirical part of the research come from a survey conducted in 281 Spanish manufacturing plants. The results show that ICT use among production workers is only positively related to higher coverage of involvement groups. On the other hand, AMT use is positively associated with the incidence of self-managed teams, job autonomy and suggestion systems. We have found differences between ICT and AMT in the strength of association with new work practices for self-managed teams and suggestion systems."

However, research studies show that the Internet has not been frequently used in the teaching of English as a foreign language (EFL) writing, especially in the Indonesian context. This study aimed to find out whether or not Indonesian EFL teachers are familiar with the Internet-based techniques for the teaching of writing. In addition, it investigated their opinions on the Internet-based techniques of teaching of writing. This study involved 17 EFL teachers from various parts of the country who were asked about their experiences and opinions dealing with the Internet-based teaching of writing. The results of the study showed that almost half of the teachers admitted that they have used Internet facilities for the teaching of writing. The other EFL teachers either have indirect involvement with the teaching of writing using Internet application or have never used Internet applications at all. However, these teachers had intention to teach writing by applying Internet-based techniques for their future practices. The study also showed that Indonesian EFL teachers valued the Internet-based teaching of writing as this practice benefits the students in terms of their writing quality and quantity, autonomy, flexibility, as well as confidence. This implies that with the development of advanced ICT, there is a hope that students’ learning of writing could be improved well."

They manifest interest in using new technologies to be part of society. Unfortunately, the applications offered on smart phones are often beyond their cognitive abilities. The goal of this study was to design a mobile cognitive assistant to enhance autonomy of people living with acquired traumatic brain injury. Participatory design methodologies guided this research by involving adults with cognitive impairments (CI) and their caregivers in the early stages of the design process. The population of the study is composed of four male adults who present cognitive impairments (three with head injury and one with stroke) and three caregivers. The first phase of this research was to design the Services Assistance Mobile and Intelligent (SAMI) application based on the needs expressed by the participants. During three focus groups, needs emerged concerning planning, health monitoring and money management and led to the implementation of assistive solutions on an Android mobile phone. During the second phase, the participants evaluated the mobile assistant SAMI at home for eight weeks. The results demonstrate that the participants were able to participate actively in the conception of SAMI and to use it successfully. People with CI showed a slight improvement in their life satisfaction. Due to the small number of participants, these promising results need to be confirmed by a larger-scale study."

Fifty-six per cent affirmed that the patient takes information obtained on the Internet to the doctor’s office, 85% that this attitude increases the patient’s autonomy, and 32.2% that it interferes with the doctor’s autonomy.Conclusion The bioethical reference point of autonomy was a great advance for the patient and has made the relationship more complex; the Internet increases the patient’s autonomy and may improve the relationship and increase his or her participation in decision making."

However, actual ICT-based devices have limited functionality and impact, mainly limited to safety. What is an ideal operational framework to enhance this field to support outdoor and social activities? Methods Review of literature and cross-disciplinary expert discussion. Results A situation-aware ICT requires a flexible fine-tuning by stakeholders of system usability and complexity of function, and of user safety and autonomy. It should operate by artificial intelligence/machine learning and should reflect harmonized stakeholder values, social context, and user residual cognitive functions. ICT services should be proposed at the prodromal stage of dementia and should be carefully validated within the life space of users in terms of quality of life, social activities, and costs. Discussion The operational framework has the potential to produce ICT and services with high clinical impact but requires substantial investment."

Insights from Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition \nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2016.01.002\n Pei-An Liao \n Hung-Hao Chang \n Jiun-Hao Wang \n Lih-Chyun Sun \nSince digital inequality among schoolchildren may exacerbate the existing rural-urban disparity, determining how to reduce rural-urban digital inequality among students remains an important policy issue. This study uses a unique and nationally representative dataset of 1953 elementary and junior high school students in Taiwan to examine the extent to which students’ characteristics, autonomy of use, family background and resource inputs may be associated with the digital self-efficacy of schoolchildren. The Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition method was applied to further investigate the relative contributions the observed characteristics made to the rural-urban digital inequality of schoolchildren. The results show that the observed differences in factors associated with students’ digital self-efficacy account for 35% of rural-urban digital inequality. Furthermore, the number of computers in homes and schools, internet connectivity at home, mothers’ educational level, and the number of weekly computer classes provided by the school play a significant role with regard to the digital inequality between rural and urban students. We examine digital divide of students between rural and urban areas in Taiwan.The Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition method was utilized.Differences in observed characteristics account for 35% of the digital divide.To increase computer availability can reduce digital divide of students."

This work, which is place- and time-independent, can lead to more autonomy and greater flexibility for workers, but it also carries serious physical as well as psychosocial risks according to this working paper. The author of this report focuses on the hidden dangers of these new ways of working: techno-stress, techno-addiction, the blurring of boundaries between work and private life, burn-outs and overtiredness, safety risks and ergonomic problems. The paper analyses the European legislation on safe and healthy working conditions and how it can be applied to this new way of working. Last, but not least, it underlines the importance of this new societal issue for workers’ representatives."

It seeks to recognise the inherent dignity, value and autonomy of persons with disabilities as members of human society and their right to live in the world in an inclusive and participatory manner on an equal basis with others. The right to live in the world encompasses the right to live in the virtual world. This necessitates ensuring accessibility to the Internet. Whereas international human rights law recognises the state as directly responsible for ensuring accessibility, it is private corporations that effectively function as the gatekeepers of the Internet. Unless corporations are proactively engaged, the virtual world cannot be made inclusive for persons with disabilities. The complexity of this issue requires looking beyond conventional forms of command-control anti-discrimination laws. This article explores a reflexive law approach to create a dialogic web between seemingly differentiated subsystems in society (with their own norms and values) in order to attain accessibility rights for persons with disabilities."

My contention is that educational technology, more specifically using Facebook, can engender pedagogical action amongst learners and educators that resonates with democratic practices. In other words, using educational technology in science and teacher education can enhance learner autonomy and equality, so that critical, self-reflexive thinking and disruptive thought and action respectively can be cultivated through technology-assisted education.

Agu1\n1African Diaspora Healthcare Ethics Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands\nFrancis C. Agu Email: agufch{at}gmail.com\n\nTwo separate reports from the Dutch Health Council of Netherlands and Social and Cultural Planning Bureau draw our attention to the tension between certain factors specifically related to healthy aging, namely, vulnerability and independency/functioning independently. Though appearing contradictory, both concepts are very relevant in the elderly health care. Hence, the objective was to develop a conceptual and ethical analysis of vulnerability and independency. To achieve that, we conducted a conceptual analysis of more than 80 scientific and philosophical data collected from Pubmed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. Both concepts are mostly defined as separate compartments, thereby missing their intrinsic relationship. For an ethically well-argued analysis of care for the elderly, we present two new definitions in which the concept of dignity provides a fundamental basis of understanding both concepts, which are indeed two human conditions. Furthermore, we underline the implications of the new conceptualization for autonomy, and give some examples of humanly respectful empowerment strategies in the elderly care."

Treaty implementation in the two countries reflects domestic institutional, economic, and political actors and ideas. Even though Mexico and Canada are highly interdependent with the United States (the main proponent of the Internet treaties), they do have some influence in determining whether and how to implement the treaties. While the United States influences copyright reform in its neighbours, both countries’ policies continue to be shaped significantly by domestic factors. These two cases suggest that domestic circumstances partly shapes the implementation of copyright laws in smaller countries."

The literary work Moscow–Pietushki, by Venedikt Yerofeyev, is treated as a superb instantiation of Soviet interaction rituals. The author rejects the Homo sovieticus model, the orthodox implementation of which leads to a recognition of individuals as puppets of the system. The analysis, inspired by Goffman’s and Collins’ findings, shows the social mechanisms which make possible the construction of a temporary world of transcendental delirium, located on the borderline of system reality. The constitution and duration of this anti-utopia system inside society reveal the relative autonomy of Soviet social actors: their conduct within this world is conditioned mainly by the availability of alcohol and the capability to play the ‘parlour game’. Such analysis, which surveys the universal logic of interaction rituals, facilitates a reasonable comparison of the practices of Soviet actors with the practices of actors located on the ‘friendly’ peripheries of the system, and with the relevancy systems and the actions of the CEE and the Western bourgeoisie. Sociologický casopis/Czech Sociological Review, 2002, Vol. 38, No. 3: 297-309 Introductory Remarks The aim of this paper is to attempt to employ interaction theory in order to characterise and explain the individual–empire relationship. By ‘explanation’ I mean the disclosure of mechanisms that underlie the behaviour of social actors, and the construction and maintenance of interaction orders and social structures. Taking up a tentative attempt at such an explanation, I shall here be using the concrete example of the literary work Moscow–Pietushki, by Venedikt Yerofeyev [1994] (MP hereafter), which is situated in the historical realities of the period of the duration and transformations of the Soviet empire. I treat literary works as the products of the activities of social actors in relation to and within society. From my point of view they are social facts, just like other products and domains of social actors’ activities. In this sense, persistence in the thesis that literary descriptions are fictitious is heuristically fruitless. This thesis is as equally idle or fruitless as statements about the fictitiousness of expectations that a ‘full-blooded’ actor will have a date with a virtual cyber-beauty or will discuss theological issues with a living St. Thomas Aquinas. I agree with Thomas J. Scheff [1997: 157ff] that, for example, the world of Shakespearean drama reveals, in an unmatched way, tensions and conflicts, and shame and 297 * I would like to express my gratitude to Alina Szulzycka for her help in improving the English style of this paper and to Henryk Domanski, Janusz Gockowski, Hanna Świda-Ziemba for their com-"

Work teams are being increasingly used in a diverse range of organizations with positive results (Emery & Barker 2007, Neuman & Wright 1999). Researchers have identified cognitive, motivational, and behavioural processes and emergent states that are essential to the effective performance of teams (Kozlowski & Ilgen 2006). Personalities of team members have been found to have considerable influence on group processes (Barrick et. al. 1998, Frederick et. al. 2005, Suzanne 2007). Similarly, self-efficacy beliefs have been found to be robust predictors of learning in training and performance in a wide range of situations (Gist 1987, Stajkovic & Luthans 1998). Team member self-efficacy affects decision making in teams (Jeffery et. al 2003), group cohesion (Pillai & Willaims 2004), and outcome expectancy (Stone & Bailey 2007). However, most research on teams focus on industrial and commercial organizations in the developed nations. Following liberalization of the Indian economy, working in teams has become an imperative (Tata & Prasad 2004). It has been argued that to survive in the competitive environment, among other changes, Indians should develop a team based work culture as it is an essential ingredient for higher levels of performance and innovation in organizations (Joshi 2001). Creating high-performing self-managed teams have been identified as a major behavioural training need to fulfil the requirements of Indian organizations in the next fifteen years (Sanghi 2003). However, Gupta (2002) has observed that due to ethnic plurality, importance of hierarchy, perceived in-group and out-group differences, Indians will resist working in teams. Poor teamwork has been identified as a major issue among the staff members in primary healthcare centres in South India (Nichter 2002). Teamwork is necessary for most development programs as it needs multiple skills to manage any development project ranging from healthcare, education or income generation projects. However, the all encompassing heterogeneity (Gupta 2002) and cultural factors (Kumar 2004) has been argued as a major threat to the self-managed work teams in Indian organizations. In a significant study of Indian managers Pearson and Chatterjee (2001) found that within a brief period, following the liberalization of Indian economy, managers in India have adopted values of teamwork and other necessary qualities needed to remain competitive in an open market; while subjugating societal qualities reinforced over hundreds of years. Similarly, studies in automobile sector have pointed out that, because of the desire to become world class manufacturers following deregulation in the early 90s, some Indian automobile manufacturers have transformed themselves into world-class organizations by creating a culture of teamwork (Dangayach & Deshmukh 2001, Som 2006). In a case study of a government organization, it was found that excellent self-managed teams were created due to the role played by an extra-ordinary leader (Dwivedi 2006). Effective teamwork in an Indian manufacturing organization had significant impact in reducing wastage (Anand 1993). However, there are only few studies which have focused on teamwork in Indian organizations and all of them were on commercial organizations. In a developing country like India a large number of not-for-profit organizations are engaged in rural development projects for the amelioration of poverty and these organizations are largely funded on project basis by donor organizations (Mishra et. al. 2005). People in these organizations work as members of rural development project teams (Duraisingam & Dollard 2005). Interventions in the areas of livelihood, watershed development, health and sanitation, education, and other income generation projects in rural areas have largely been carried out by not-for-profit organizations with or without direct support of other government agencies. …"

These private regimes enjoy varying degrees of autonomy from states and from international law. Some, such as the private norms related to lex mercatoria, the Internet, sports, and finance, have gained importance and density. These private legal networks can aid in the enforcement of state law but also can work independently of or even against it. This paper analyses the rationale of some private legal regimes and reveals their differences from state law. It shows that a significant number of actors are regulated by private legal norms that often ignore domestic legal systems. Some authors believe that private legal regimes have already eclipsed state law in importance. Also presented are thoughts on how legal theory might best approach private legal regimes."

Lima \nThe central role of evaluation, institutional assessment and quality assurance processes of schools and universities in education policy is object of discussion also considering the reform of the state. New Public Management theories and managerialist perspectives are considered some of the main sources of inspiration and legitimation in the dominant context of an audit education. Preliminary empirical data from external assessment of Portuguese primary and secondary schools are introduced and interpreted according to the main concepts and organizational representations of school found in external reports. Examining some of the central organizational images and meanings of school, school culture, autonomy, goals, leadership and effectiveness included in the external reviews, the author stresses the importance of formal, rational and bureaucratic images of schools. Several new research questions are presented for further inquiry based on the hypothesis of what it is called by the author the process of hyperbureaucratization of educational organizations. Some of the main dimensions of the concept of bureaucracy as presented by Max Weber are revisited in close relation with neo-scientific approaches of quality assurance and taking in consideration the use of information and communication technologies. Accordingly the author suggests that much more importance must be given to formal and rational models of interpreting educational organizations because assessment and quality assurance procedures are contributing to the formalization of schools and universities and to the intensification of their process of rationalization, i. e., to the emergence of an analytic image of schools as hyperbureaucracies."

Students, including graduates and undergraduates from a Midwestern university, rated their preference for personal relevance, collaboration, negotiation, and autonomy as key learning experiences embodied in CLE. Results indicated that undergraduates were more likely than graduate students to prefer collaboration and negotiation experiences. Expanding on the results of students’ quantitative ratings, students’ and instructors’ perspectives of collaboration were explored. Eight participants (four students and four instructors) participated in one-on-one interview sessions. Themes that emerged from the qualitative analysis showed that the differences in students’ preference for collaboration related to students’ perceptions of unequal opportunities to collaborate, perceived benefits, and diverse backgrounds and orientations. In addition, conditions necessary for effective collaboration in the college environment were explored. Thematic analysis produced three themes: understanding collaboration process; monitoring, assessment, and evaluation system; and group composition. Implications for practice in the college classroom have been discussed."

Merrick \n John Harvey \n Michael Barlow \nThis paper considers two emerging interdisciplinary, but related topics that are likely to create tipping points in advancing the engineering and science areas. Trusted Autonomy (TA) is a field of research that focuses on understanding and designing the interaction space between two entities each of which exhibits a level of autonomy. These entities can be humans, machines, or a mix of the two. Cognitive Cyber Symbiosis (CoCyS) is a cloud that uses humans and machines for decision-making. In CoCyS, human-machine teams are viewed as a network with each node comprising humans (as computational machines) or computers. CoCyS focuses on the architecture and interface of a Trusted Autonomous System. This paper examines these two concepts and seeks to remove ambiguity by introducing formal definitions for these concepts. It then discusses open challenges for TA and CoCyS, that is, whether a team made of humans and machines can work in fluid, seamless harmony."

It emphasizes that institutional capacity building of the LDCs in India is highly relevant in view of the ongoing reforms and restructuring, increasing vulnerabilities of the interconnected grid, rapid growth in the interconnection size, generation capacity addition, equipment/human failure, cyber attacks, environmental threats and fast changing regulatory framework in India. The paper argues that the effective coordination amongst the system operators can come by establishing functional and financial autonomy of the LDCs as well as by strengthening the capabilities of the human resource working in the LDC."

Székely \nSocietal risks of the new information and communication technologies including information privacy issues, have not yet been sufficiently recognized in the former socialist countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Newly introduced data protection legislation is an important step in this process, but in the highly politicized environment the problem often appears to be primarily a legal and political issue. The first Hungarian research on public opinion and mass communication in relation to information privacy shows a measurable desire for information autonomy and a considerable mistrust of information authorities, but nevertheless a genera! obedience in providing personal data. The stratum which exhibits a heightened data protection consciousness, higher sensitivity to privacy and increased distrust of computerized data processing comprises 16 per cent of the total sample. The research also shows that the desire for information privacy in the society is not adequately manifested in the press, nor in the awareness of political and professional circles. International cooperation is needed in research activity."

    "text": "Doc 548 :  The Internet in British Columbia Classrooms: Learning Environments in New Contexts, 7(15) \n\n David B. Zandvliet \n Laura Buker \nThis article reports on a study of classroom environments in emerging Internet classrooms in British Columbia, Canada. The study involved an evaluation of the physical and psychosocial learning environments in these settings through a combination of case studies and questionnaires. This work focuses on the results obtained from the administration of a student questionnaire designed to measure aspects of the psychosocial learning environment in these settings and to relate these factors to students’ satisfaction with learning and to other physical aspects of the learning environment. Versions of the What Is Happening in This Classroom (WIHIC) instrument and Computerized Classroom Environment Checklist (CCEC) were administered to 358 high school students in 22 classrooms from six schools around the province. Analysis of classroom environment data revealed that student autonomy/independence and task orientation are associated with students’ satisfaction with learning. Relating data to physical measures such as the workspace and visual environments demonstrated significant associations between the physical and psychosocial learning environment in technology-rich classrooms. Further qualitative data suggest that factors related to teaching styles, classroom design, and the learning environment interact to influence students’ satisfaction with learning."

Many authors have addressed it from Psychology to Sociology, Anthropology and Cultural Studies. Historically we find first an identification with the gods, the earth and blood. In Modernity, the individual is separated from its community and its original circumstances, developing a higher degree of individual autonomy. In our present mediatized societies, reality is not only mediated by information and communication technologies, but also recreated through virtual technologies and thus deductible to equations, data and information. This process is reshaping our identities, which have suffered transformations imposed by the shock and the juxtaposition between the process of globalization and local cultures, distorting mechanisms of cultural identification, models, values and styles. As a conclusion, we present three ‘dimensions’ in which identity processes are built: referential, inter-referential and selfreferential. Finally, we ask ourselves what Nietzsche did 100 years ago: “is that which I am, that, for you, I am no longer? Is that what ‘I am’, that, for you, I am not? Is it that I have become another? Am I a stranger to myself?"

Universities and schools have been reinforcing traditional classroom-based instructions with online learning management systems. Students can be benefited through the more frequent online interaction with the teacher for their independent learning outside the classroom. This paper explains what the multimedia-assisted language instruction means in English education in college classrooms and then examines how teachers can help students develop learner autonomy and classroom interaction using Moodle, an open source learning management system. Students of this study responded that English language materials provided through this multimedia-assisted instruction were very effective and that they felt doing class activities through online was very convenient because they could control their own learning according to their pace and situations. While sharing common interests and ideas about studying English or life events, they could study in interactive and collaborative ways. Students also answered that they could study voluntarily and more through these online learning activities."

Evidently, current research is primarily focused on its technological development. However, involving adolescents’ voices regarding the desirability of this monitoring is important; particularly because automatic monitoring might invade adolescents’ privacy and freedom, and consequently evoke reactance. In this study, fourteen focus groups were conducted with adolescents (N = 66) between 12 and 18 years old. The goal was to obtain insights into adolescents’ opinions on desirability and priorities for automatically detecting harmful content on SNSs. Opinions reflect the contention between a need for protection online versus the preservation of freedom. Most adolescents in this study are in favour of automatic monitoring for situations they perceive as uncontrollable or that they cannot solve themselves. Clear priorities for detection must be set in order to ensure the privacy and autonomy of adolescents. Moreover, monitoring actions aiming at the prevention of harm are required."

The new forms of labour in the research are divided into three categories: professional labour, paid temporary labour, and free labour. On the one hand, the complex and ambivalent relationships between different categories of labourers are investigated; on the other hand, labourers’ working life experiences are illustrated via in-depth interviews.\nPractically, this research focuses on workers in a large Internet company providing social networking services, Campus (anonymous). Workers in the research are explored via several aspects, such as working time and payment, working status, experience of autonomy, as well as agency, referring to the negotiation and resistance between labour, company and the state. Theoretically, this research discusses the agency of labour which is largely ignored by the existing research, as well as seeks to contribute a bridge between the existing western research of cultural labour and Chinese new media labour."

A fully autonomous driverless car relies on no external inputs, including GPS and solely learns from its environment using learning algorithms. These cars decide when they drive, learn from human drivers and bid for insurance in real time. Full autonomy is pitched as a good end in itself, fixing human inadequacies and creating safety and certainty by the elimination of human involvement. Using the ACTIVE ethics framework, an ethical response to the fully autonomous driverless cars is developed by addressing autonomy, community, transparency, identity, value and empathy. I suggest that the pursuit of full autonomy does not recognise the essential importance of interdependencies between humans and machines. The removal of human involvement should require the driverless car to be more connected with its environment, drawing all the information it can from infrastructure, internet and other road users. This requires a systemic view, which addresses systems and relationships, which recognises the place of driverless cars in a connected system, which is open to the study of complex relationships, both networked and hierarchical."

Many researches have been conducted about this issue. Now the tendency is pointed out specifically for improving students’ competency in speaking. Speaking is normally learned in the classroom setting in which learners have interlocutor as their speaking partner and under direct supervision from the lecturer. The discussion bellow will concern about some internet links that can be used for speaking study. The learners can study by using these internet links independently and record their own voice and video for their own self- assessment. They choose their own target and links to access and determine their own learning target. In the meantime, they also collect the recording to their teacher for assessment purpose."

It will proceed by arguing that Benjamin Barber’s republicanism deserves to be reconsidered in the light of the current trivialization and acceleration of politics by means of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). A reinterpretation of the poetics present in Barber’s “political talk” might be interesting to the theory of deliberative democracy, specially in relation to the concept of “deliberation within” by Robert Goodin (2010) and the defense of the role emotions play in political life by Martha Nussbaum (2013). After stressing the importance of two endangered capabilities –attentive listening and slow reading–, the article concludes that poetry might be an emancipatory cultural practice within the enlightenment-romantic program that strives for mutually educating the reason, the sensibility, and the autonomy of citizens."

An emerging global information society serves to building global knowledge societies as source for further development. Conventional paradigms of sciences starts to be more blemish and prone to redefinition of there foundations, understood as scientific knowledge. The perspective of knowledge and ideals of rationality are both heavily influenced by a new contemporary scientific thinking, through tools, inherent of autonomy and uncertainty. A new understanding of the world in terms of open dynamic heterogeneous uncertain systems is needed. Among the conclusions: classical rational reasoning is mainly aiming at effectiveness, not at uncertain knowledge processing, because of its temporality (mainly its ineffectiveness in dealing with future events); a bounded-rationality approach enables both, better economic models and better modelling, being based on trends in economic modelling as well as on agent-oriented software engineering."

The Confederate narrative’s diminishment of civil rights has been regularly challenged, but it stubbornly persists. Today the narrative survives in imprecise and unquestioning odes to state sovereignty. That appreciation of the doctrines of federalism and separation of powers should govern adjudication of the Constitution’s meaning is unarguable. That it should preclude national responsibility for the protection of human rights is, however, unacceptable. We analyze the relationship, over time, between assertions of civil rights and calls for the protection of local autonomy and control. This analysis reveals a troubling sequence: The Confederate narrative was shamefully intertwined with the defense of American chattel slavery. It survived profound challenges raised by post-Reconstruction civil rights claimants, and by mid-Twentieth century civil rights movements, and it reemerges regularly to pose questionable but unanswered challenges to calls for national protection of civil rights. Our close examination of the Confederate narrative’s jurisprudential effects exposes an urgent need to address the consequential but under-recognized tension between human and civil rights in the United States on the one hand and local autonomy on the other."

Social computing focuses on how users may have more autonomy to express their ideas and participate in social exchanges in various ways, one of which may be peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing. Given the greater risk of opportunistic behavior by malicious or criminal communities in P2P networks, it is crucial to understand the factors that affect individual’s use of P2P file sharing software. In this paper, we develop and empirically test a research model that includes trust beliefs and perceived risks as two major antecedent beliefs to the usage intention. Six trust antecedents are assessed including knowledge-based trust, cognitive trust, and both organizational and peer-network factors of institutional trust. Our preliminary results show general support for the model and offer some important implications for software vendors in P2P sharing industry and regulatory bodies."

The present study (N = 548) aimed to investigate the relation between perceived parenting style (in terms of autonomy support and psychological control) and cyber-bullying in adolescence. Thereby, the study tested for the intervening role of adolescent need satisfaction (i.e., autonomy and relatedness), empathic concern towards others, and adolescents’ recognition of full humanness to cyber-bullying offenders and victims. Findings revealed both a direct and an indirect relation between parenting and cyber-bullying. More specifically, parental psychological control directly predicted cyber-bullying, whereas parental autonomy support related to less cyber-bullying indirectly, as it was associated with the satisfaction of adolescents’ need for autonomy, which predicted more empathic concern towards others, which in turn differentially related to recognition of humanness to victims and bullies. The discussion focuses on the implications of the current findings."

The influx of new information and communication technologies (ICTs) lead us to question: “How do we find the balance between continuity and discontinuity whilst critically renewing our educational traditions?” The paper develops a philosophical understanding that transcends utopian and dystopian claims that IT is either “becoming education” or “destroying the essence of education,” respectively. This philosophical perspective is developed around: (1) the question of student autonomy and the potential of its being undermined through ICT and (2) the processes through which students can potentially resist these threats. The paper develops and applies the philosophical understanding to the question of student autonomy. First, the paper emphasizes the importance of considering student autonomy in the debates around the relationship of ICT and education. Second, the paper proposes a conceptual model of autonomy, drawing upon some important ideas of Habermas and pragmatist thinking. Third, the paper identifies some systemic threats on educational processes arising from globalization and corporatization. Fourth, I outline the Habermasian response to these threats as a means to understand the nature of student response. Finally, drawing upon the conceptual ideas of autonomy presented, I consider five specific approaches to examine the question of the reform of MIS education."

Information societies have been formed by the widespread utilization of information and communication technologies in human social life and generally focus on the computer systems and information networks. Nowadays, various technologies of medical informatics comprise an important component of the management infrastructures of health care systems. Medical informatics is the development and assessment of specific methods and systems for acquisition, processing and analyzing patients’ data with the help of knowledge and information from scientific researches. Moreover, it intends to increase access, improve quality and decrease the costs of care through decreasing chronological and geographical limitations. On the other hand, ethics have been always considered as a basic component of these systems. The increasing development of digital technologies and their application in health information management provides numerous benefits; however, it encounters health care managers with new challenges in the information societies. These challenges may has been mainly caused by the conflicts among ethical principles by themselves or disregarding them in the field of medical informatics. Therefore, careful consideration of info ethics as well as beneficence, autonomy, fidelity and justice is essential to overcome those conflicts in the information societies."

Email: druzhilov@mail.ru Address: 23 Kutuzova St., Novokuznetsk, 654041, Russian Federation.The study aims to investigate into the higher education system that had been developed in Russia by the Revolution of 1917. It has been demonstrated that the accumulated educational lag had been eliminated actively during the two decades preceding the World War I by establishing new universities and professional educational institutions and by creating a series of private universities in addition to the system of governmental ones.In the dawn of capitalism, higher education was on the rise in Russia. There were ever more professors, and the number of students had increased almost ten times by that time. There also was an increase in social value of university graduates’ labor. The academic degree system was pretty close to that of Western Europe (Master and Doctor degrees), while requirements for candidates were much higher in Russia than abroad. As a professional group, university intelligentsia played a prominent role in social, economic, political, and cultural life of the pre-revolutionary Russia. In the dialogue with the government and the society, the university association defended the principles of university autonomy, which, at the time, was limited by bureaucracy and total control of the Ministry of National Education.The Soviet Union put an end to the progressive development of higher schools in Russia. The existing higher education system was fully destroyed, while university intelligentsia, as a social and professional group bearing educational culture and university traditions, was virtually obliterated in the epoch of revolutionary terror and political repressions."

It is part of a two-year research-intervention conducted with science teachers from a private school. Data was first collected through ethnographic notes and audio-recorded focus groups with 256 students. Although appreciated by students, the implementation provoked conflicts at the school community level. Building on the Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) and on the expansive learning cycle aiming at transforming an activity system, the actual study aims at deepening our understanding of the origins of contradictions at and between some of the poles of multileveled activity system that is object-oriented, mediated by artefacts (instruments), and comprises the community, rules and division of labor poles. Findings highlight the clash in the participant teachers’ values versus the community’s in implementing innovative teaching practice. Teachers report favoring nontraditional ways of teaching and giving more room to adolescents’ autonomy while the stakeholders (school principal, parents) are often looking for traditional teaching practices and students’ school achievement. The results put into evidence the need to identify common grounds and to make sense of the new science teaching approach aiming at promoting students’ autonomy, critical judgment, and school success levels."

Kanungo \nStudies of stress and affiliation (3) suggest that workers who experience more stress in their jobs will exhibit greater affiliative behavior than workers who experience less stress. However, the former group of workers may show less desire for autonomy and responsibility in their jobs, because under higher levels of stress greater job responsibility may be viewed more as a burden than a challenge (1). To test these hypotheses, 142 nursing staff of a hospital were administered Porter’s (2) perceived need satisfaction questionnaire followed by an intensive interview. Fourteen supervisors divided the total sample into three groups of nursing jobs, of low (n = 51). medium (n = 591, and high (n = 32) stress on the basis of severity of patients’ illness in the nursing units. The validity of this manipulation was ascertained by determining the perceived levels of stress in the three groups, using semantic differential type scales. The groups significantly differed from each other (F3.138 = 5.55, fi < .05) with respea to perceived levels of job’scress. Analysis of variance of scores from the three groups representing satisfaction with six need categories (2) showed a significant interaction (F10.m = 4.84, p < .05). Nurses belonging to the highly stressed group (dealing with terminal patients) showed a higher level of social need satisfaction than the group with low stress (t = 4.54, fi < .05) working in outpatient clinics. Interview data suggested that higher social need satisfaction in the highly stressed group resulted from cohesive team work and greater social interaction among nursing staff on intensive care units. Their social relationships often went beyond the work place to parties and informal get-togethers where work problems and experiences were shared. Satisfaction wich autonomy and responsibility on the job showed similar trends. Highly stressed groups showed greater satisfaction wich their job autonomy than groups under low stress (t = 4.48, fi < .05). Considering the fact that all three groups perceived similar levels of job responsibility and autonomy in their jobs, the results suggest chat the group under low stress wanted to have mote job autonomy and responsibility than their jobs provided. The highly stressed group, on the other hand, did not want more autonomy than was present in their jobs and therefore were more sltisfied with what they had. Interview data indicated that they preferred to share responsibility for decisions about patients with their peers or if possible defer these decisions to a higher authority. REFERENCES"

Zondag \nThe author presents a study of the relationship between expressive individualism and religiosity. Data were collected from participants in internet forums concerned with New Age and Christian religiosity (N=422). Through factor analysis, four dimensions of expressive individualism were identified: autonomy, setting oneself apart from others, personal development, and expression of emotions. The relationship between expressive individualism and religion was found to be ambivalent and negatively dominated by autonomy. After eliminating the effect of autonomy, two patterns remained visible, both characterized by a positive connection to religiosity. Setting oneself apart from others is associated with more traditional and institutional religiosity, and personal development with a more private mode of religiosity. The explanation of this concealed longing for religion is sought in the pressure resulting from expressive individualism as a way of life."

M. Scanlon suggested and later rejected the notion that autonomous agency ought to be a primary constraint on most justifications used to restrict speech. The concept of autonomy, he said, was notoriously vague and slippery as a basis for judging free-speech restrictions. Instead, Scanlon argued that free expression- and proposed restrictions on it- should be justified in terms of our various interests in speech as participants and as audience members. Reliance on autonomy does not provide the justificatory force for a theory of free expression, he said. However, in his landmark 1998 book, What We Owe to Each Other, Scanlon relies heavily on autonomous agency as the foundation of several of his key claims. Scanlon’s claims that our interests to protect free expression conflict with his reliance on autonomous agency in What We Owe to Each Other and have important implications for efforts both to cultivate a healthy public sphere and protect the open architecture of the Internet within an increasingly global media culture."

Methods: Population of Monte Negro county was reached by the e-health promotion activities including tele-education for community health workers, teachers and local health professionals with the videoconferencing, CD-ROM development and Cybertutor technologies. The population reached was calculated by the reach of these professionals into their daily activities. Results: The e-health activities held by Project USP in Rondonia are reaching local stakeholders to expand the spread of health knowledge within a region with severe difficulties of access to information and health care. These stakeholders, mainly working locally in the educational and auxiliary health professions, are seizing their opportunity to provoke autonomy in the population they work with, disseminating information among children in public schools and health care, possibly reaching more than 1,380 families. Conclusion: E-health activities showed to be important tool for health promotion to Amazonian communities. People living in regions with difficult access to many social needs, such as riverside communities, must be respected as citizens and thus their right to health must be ensured, which is provided in the Brazilian constitution, and it should be promoted through education, prevention and adequate health services."

It should be based on promoting educational actors’ critical awareness of the educational context and their autonomy. This paper reveals the potential of educational actors’ autonomy as a core value of lifelong learning. It demonstrates the relevance of autonomy as an important competence of educational actors from philosophical, psychological and pedagogical perspectives. The paper proves that autonomy is beneficial for students’ and teachers’ personal and professional self-development, as well as for their educational and professional efficiency and psychological comfort. It emphasizes readiness for autonomy in both university teachers and students as a key factor in successful and productive use of the benefits autonomy offers for lifelong learning."

Merrick \nDespite the advances made in artificial intelligence, software agents, and robotics, there is little we see today that we can truly call a fully autonomous system. We conjecture that the main inhibitor for advancing autonomy is lack of trust. Trusted autonomy is the scientific and engineering field to establish the foundations and ground work for developing trusted autonomous systems (robotics and software agents) that can be used in our daily life, and can be integrated with humans seamlessly, naturally, and efficiently. In this paper, we review this literature to reveal opportunities for researchers and practitioners to work on topics that can create a leap forward in advancing the field of trusted autonomy. We focus this paper on the trust component as the uniting technology between humans and machines. Our inquiry into this topic revolves around three subtopics: 1) reviewing and positioning the trust modeling literature for the purpose of trusted autonomy; 2) reviewing a critical subset of sensor technologies that allow a machine to sense human states; and 3) distilling some critical questions for advancing the field of trusted autonomy. The inquiry is augmented with conceptual models that we propose along the way by recompiling and reshaping the literature into forms that enable trusted autonomous systems to become a reality. This paper offers a vision for a Trusted Cyborg Swarm, an extension of our previous Cognitive Cyber Symbiosis concept, whereby humans and machines meld together in a harmonious, seamless, and coordinated manner."

Over the past few years, some sports organizations have attempted to restrict such access, as well as what reporters can publish via social media. In the digital era, access and publishing autonomy, as institutionalized concepts, are evolving rapidly. Hypotheses tying access and work practices to reporters’ perceptions of the legitimacy they experience are developed and tested via a structural equation model, using responses to a survey of journalists in American intercollegiate athletics and observed dimensions of access and autonomy to measure a latent variable of legitimacy. The model suggests that reporters have mixed views about whether they possess the legitimacy they need to do their jobs."

Smith \n David Grande \n Raina M. Merchant \nWith over 1.7 billion individuals engaged in social media, patients and consumers share more about their lives than ever before through wearable devices, smartphone applications, and social media outlets. This cornucopia of data offers significant opportunity for health researchers and clinicians to track and explore how digital presence contributes to patients’ health outcomes and use of health care resources. While patients readily share their information with online communities, it is imperative that they maintain a sense of autonomy over who has access to such data. Recent data breaches of major insurance companies and retailers illustrate the challenges and vulnerabilities related to information safety and privacy. Many Web sites and mobile apps require users to agree to data policies, but how those data are mined, protected, used, and externally shared is frequently nontransparent, resulting in a climate of fear and distrust around all forums of digital information sharing. Although such skepticism is perhaps justified, it should not deter health researchers from attempting to collect and analyze these novel data for the purpose of designing unique health interventions. By clarifying intent around digital data acquisition, simplifying consent procedures, and affirming a commitment to privacy, the authors contend that health researchers can partner with patients to transform the boundaries of scientific inquiry."

And yet, communities persist in the face of this constant motion. This is a qualitative study of a mobile labor group—taxi drivers in Chicago. Similar to Wallis’s (2011) conclusions, I found that access to and use of a mobile phone does not automatically imbue taxi drivers with power and autonomy from forces that seem to be working against them. However, access to mobile phones does help to shake up the hierarchy of control in the taxi industry. This study has also identified another type of community where the theory of polymedia (Madianou & Miller, 2012) applies, that is, labor communities, and has shown that while choice of technology may offer some sense of power, access to mobile communication technology does not necessarily result in significant changes in power structures within and surrounding a community."

However as useage of SNS became excessive, SNS addiction became a social problem. Meanwhile the problem that users leavning SNS because of negative perceptions about SNS became issue. As both SNS addiction and continuance are important when using SNS, this study examines factors affecting Facebook addiction and continuance. We derive three personal traits, which is autonomy, competence, relatedness as variables that affect Facebook addiction and continuance to use Facebook. The authors` structural equation model using data, collected from 204 Facebook user, showed that autonomy and competence significantly affected Facebook addiction. Also, autonomy, competence and relatedness significantly affect Facebook continuance."

Gilbert \n Tatiana Begotti \nThe Internet can be a tool to promote adolescent development.The Internet promotes identity formation primarily as a tool to develop interests and expertise.The Internet promotes autonomy by providing a private space, and a way for adolescents to negotiate and test parental rules.Teens use the internet to form and maintain friendships, but less often to form romantic relationships. This study explored adolescents’ opinions about how Internet use supports the achievement of their developmental tasks. Qualitative data were collected in focus groups interviews with 127 Italian Internet users (11-20) attending middle and high schools. Discussions were recorded, transcribed and analyzed using content analysis. Results showed that the Internet plays important functions in identity formation, personal autonomy, and relationships outside the family. It allows teens to develop their own interests, to identify with others and, at the same time, differentiate from others. The Internet is also an arena in which adolescents develop and practice autonomy. The Internet can be a source of conflict with parents, because of parents’ concerns about Internet use. However, the Internet can also be a meeting ground with parents. Finally, participants indicated the Internet is used to form close relationships with peers. Gender and age differences are discussed. Although the study is cross-sectional and relies only on adolescent report, findings illustrate how the conceptual framework of developmental goals may be helpful for understanding how the Internet can affect adolescents’ lives."

The present research examined the role of culture and the Autonomous-Related self-construal in predicting for different aspects of Social Networking Sites (SNS) usage in three Asian countries, especially focusing on those aspects serving interpersonal goals. Participants in this cross-cultural study included 305 university students from Malaysia (n = 105), South Korea (n = 113), and China (n = 87). The study explored specific social and interpersonal behaviors on SNS, such as browsing the contacts’ profiles, checking for updates, and improving contact with SNS contacts, as well as the intensity of SNS use, hypothesizing that those with high intensity of use in the Asian context may be doing so to achieve the social goal of maintaining contact and keeping updated with friends. Two scales measuring activities on other users’ profiles and contact with friends’ profiles were developed and validated. As predicted, some cross-cultural differences were found. Koreans were more likely to use SNS to increase contact but tended to spend less time browsing contacts’ profiles than the Malaysians and Chinese. The intensity of SNS use differed between the countries as well, where Malaysians reported higher intensity than Koreans and Chinese. Consistent with study predictions, Koreans were found with the highest Autonomous-Related self-construal scores. The Autonomous-Related self-construal predicted SNS intensity. The findings suggest that cultural contexts, along with the way the self is construed in different cultures, may encourage different types of SNS usage. The authors discuss study implications and suggest future research directions."

It is based primarily on research conducted on the Sustaining IT use by older people to promote autonomy and independence Sus-IT project in the UK over a four-year period working with over 1,000 older people using mixed research methods within a participative framework. It is further informed by other studies. The rich, multi-faceted evidence reveals on the one hand the extensive learning and support needs and requirements of older users of information and communication technologies ICTs and, on the other, the dearth of reliable and ongoing support provision. ICT learning and support in the UK relies primarily on the goodwill of friends and family and on the availability of staff and volunteers in community venues, such as public libraries. Arrangements are often ad hoc and variable in quality and reliability. In a facilitated workshop, the learning and ICT support needs of older people and their preferred forms of provision were documented and deliberated. This generated a clear set of user requirements. To meet these requirements a proposition for community-based ICT support provision has been developed and refined. The paper concludes with consideration of this proposition which offers a powerful way to reduce the widespread digital inequalities among older people."

However currently uninvestigated is the possibility that the threat of such surveillance on these sites might constrain the self presented offline in ‘reality’, known here as ‘the extended chilling effect’. The purpose of this study is to examine the existence of this ‘extended chilling effect’. Drawing on theories of self-awareness and self-presentation, the impact of surveillance in SNS is theorized to lead to an awareness of online audiences in offline domains, stimulating a self-comparison process that results in impression management. A mixed methods study of semi-structured interviews (n?=?28) and a 2?×?2 between-subjects experiment (n?=?80), provides support for offline impression management in order to avoid an undesired image being projected to online audiences. The novel finding that the chilling effect has extended highlights the potential dangers of online peer-to-peer surveillance for autonomy and freedom of expression in our offline lives. Accounts provided of ‘chilled’ behavior offline due to online surveillance.Model tested for the process underlying the ‘chilling’ of behavior offline.Saliency of Facebook offline increases public self-awareness.Support provided for the ‘extended chilling’ effect of Social Network Sites."

Lee \n Sasha Nikolic \n Peter James Vial \n Christian Ritz \n Wanqing Li \n Thomas Goldfinch \nProject-based learning is a widely used pedagogical strategy in engineering education shown to be effective in fostering problem-solving, design, and teamwork skills. There are distinct benefits to be gained from giving students autonomy in determining the nature and scope of the projects that they wish to undertake, but a lack of expert guidance and of a clear direction at the outset can result in confusion, frustration, and unfulfilled goals. Moreover, engineering schools face the imperative of providing students with opportunities to engage with industry during their courses, which can be difficult to accomplish due to logistical and time constraints. This paper reports on a case study in which undergraduate students of electrical, computer, mechatronics, and telecommunications engineering interacted with representatives from industry to obtain feedback at the inception phase of their design projects. Students pitched their ideas to the industry guests at a virtual “trade fair” held within a hybrid video conferencing and three-dimensional (3-D) virtual world environment, in preparation for the assessable pitches that they had to deliver on campus to a faculty audience. Survey and assessment results attest to the participants’ satisfaction as well as to the effectiveness of the approach in improving student self-efficacy and performance. The paper concludes with recommendations for engineering educators looking to implement similar initiatives and a brief outline of the authors’ plans for the future."

Krishen \n Orie Berezan \n Shaurya Agarwal \n Pushkin Kachroo \nAbstract Successful social media networks motivate people to engage in behaviors that speak to their most basic psychological needs through citizenship in a virtual society. These environments provide individuals with the ability to build relationships (relatedness), exercise competence, and express autonomy. Recipes for satisfying these basic needs are vital to the success of virtual societies. This research contributes to existing literature by framing social media interaction using the self-determination theory (SDT); the study analyzes a sample of 570 social networking participants using the generations of baby boomers, generation X, and millennials with fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). Findings indicate that affinity, belonging, interactivity, and innovativeness are all base expectations for social media networking usage, depending on the generational cohort. Indeed, understanding the motivational needs of unique generational cohorts allows marketers to more effectively design precise adaptive strategies for their social media, which can impact engagement and thereby loyalty."

The autonomy in the construction of social identity has become more prominent. As resistance identity and project identity rise,legitimizing identity is under challenge. Construction of social identity in the Internet society is a process of organizing different meanings and values,among which ideology occupies a central position. In the Internet society,ideology has shifted from a rational type to a perceptual one,therefore perceptual ideology occupies a central position in the construction of social identity. Perceptual ideology,rooted in the human heart,empowers social identity on the internet,which is reflected by the power hidden in the grass-roots society."

However, how to establish trust among strangers without prior relationship and common security domain poses much difficulty for these activities. To resolve these problems, a promising approach known as Automated Trust Negotiation (ATN), which establishes the trust between strangers with iterative disclosure of credentials and access control policies, is proposed. In this paper, a comprehensive survey of research on ATN is presented, and some basic techniques, e.g. negotiation model and architecture, access control policy specification, credential description and credential chain discovery, are introduced and compared. Then based on the analysis of the shortcomings and problems of the techniques, the trend of research and application is discussed. All these work may contribute to the further work on trust establishment for entities with privacy protection and autonomy in open internet."

Smith \nMary Hemingway Rees died in 1954, some time before many of us here had the opportunity to know her, or the World Federation for Mental Health. Those of us who did not know her are so much the poorer. There is always too little of courage and autonomy, grace and tranquility in this present world, qualities that Mrs. Rees possessed and was possessed by. In these two decades since her death, our world has become quite unlike the world she knew. Still those qualities of life she achieved are the same each of us would strive for. Her personality and career being what they were, the choice of subject for these memorial lectures is especially appropriate: values in mental health. However, there is no way, given what has happened in psychology and in religious affairs, for that subject to be approached in a fashion similar to the first lecture given by Dr. Henry Dicks. For example, it was just two years before Mary Rees’s death that I had my first training experience in a mental hospital, and I recall sitting in general case conferences with all of us attempting to get acquainted with and accustomed to the most recent change in nomenclature for behavioral syndromes. What was new then has now been replaced more than once. This was all before the era of the Esalen Institutes, Carl Rogers’s second phase, humanistic psychology, Ida Rolf, sensitivity training, the Primal Scream, Gestalt therapy, behavior modifica tion, and, of course, transactional analysis, to say nothing of the revolution by the psychatropic chemicals and the broad use of hallucinogenic drugs. In this same period, on the spiritual side, the Reverend Mr. Robinson helped us see that God is dead in his book Honest to God. The churches came to be characterized as museums of man’s past, and deluded, experience. Spiritual truth came to us in the West from the East, the flower children appeared on the scene with transcendental meditation, and the worldwide revolution of youth thrust us into a paroxysm of protest"

The implementation of Internet-based CET has prompted the action research in the teaching of English speaking. The establishment of English listening and speaking teaching mode is based on further exploration in such areas as the scientific combination of listening and speaking tasks, the development of English speaking ability rating systems, and the design and implementation of English speaking test, etc."

Analysis of the research data shows that online customers’ self-demand was also significantly affected by consumer familiarity with the web site. Demand was also shown to be significantly and positively affected by online motivations. Autonomy;competence in using the Internet;and relatedness consumer self-determination levels were correlated and had a significant positive effect. Online consumers were shown to have higher levels of self-determination,however they were shown to be more sceptical about the reliability and accuracy of information gathered online."

Objectives To identify potential reasons for this threat. Aims To look at psychiatry with concepts used by the sociology of professions. Methods Professions are characterized – and these concept will be used for analysis here – by (1) ownership of a specialized body of knowledge and skills, which defines the field of competence and the scope of potential clients, including the demarcation from other professions; (2) holding a high status in society; (3) being granted autonomy by society, e.g. in recruiting and excluding members; and (4) being obliged, in return for the above, to guarantee high quality standards in providing services and following ethical rules. Results Six intertwined areas of concern are identified: three of them, the increasing criticism by users and carers, the intrusion of other professions, and psychiatry’s negative image in society, can be traced back to problems with the other three concerning the “ownership of a specialized body of knowledge and skills”. With the preparation and advent of DSM-5, discussions about the lack of validity of psychiatric disease entities have gone viral in the time of the internet. The attempts to “carve nature at its joints” have failed, and this is more and more perceived from outside, threatening psychiatry’s status in society and potentially turning away to be psychiatrists. Conclusion Looking at psychiatry as a profession may help to better understand its current situation."

Based on the analysis of the theory of collective action, this paper studies its applicability and implications for collective action in the internet. Internet users’ attitudes and opinions concerning Diaoyu Island Incident were surveyed randomly; the access to information of opinion leadersof different network communities through weak tieswas studied; Internet users in the network of the opinion leadersbuild a network of consensusthrough strong ties and form the an online public sphere, sharing sentiments, and in this way online interactions are strengthened, while opinions are assimilated, leading to the formation of explosive online movements. On this basis, this paper analyzes the structural characteristics of network movement, and puts forward countermeasures and suggestions to guide network movement from the perspectives of government control, network organization and the users."

Since there exist some background and cultural differences between individuals,the effects of the feedback on some hot issues tend to produce results beyond and out of the intended purpose. This paper mainly analyzes the cause of mobile ad hoc network and its characteristics,puts forward several proposals from the angle of institution ethics to strengthen the organizational management so as to deal with the self- organization in the crisis scientifically."

Neither general nor abstract concepts of character take into account the concrete experience of a book. Fourth, character study seems to ignore the real object of criticism and teaching which is to try to understand the moral vision of the ‘7Leon Surmelian, Techniques of Fiction Writing: Measure and Madness (Garden City, New York: Doubleday and Co., Inc., 1968), p. 139.

Fifth, character study deflects attention from the unity of the total work to see the part as larger than the whole. For example, a character study might take into account Hamlet the prince rather than Hamlet the play. Sixth, character study tends to deny the autonomy of the created artifact and confuse real emotions with aesthetic emotions.’ Finally, many authors discourage character study by propagating the attitude that literary characters are mysterious gifts given them from some unknown source. All of these criticisms might be divided into two categories. The idea that reading a work of literature is only an aesthetic experience and should never be confused with an emotional experience is expressed in the first and sixth reasons given for avoiding character study. The other five criticisms of character study have to do generally with the idea that at its best character study is good description which nonetheless does not fulfill the critical task, or that, at its worst, it attempts to be analytical but fails because it does not bridge the gap between character itself and the relation of character to the work as a whole and to the reading experience. From a psychological perspective, character is not separate from the work as a whole. Rather, character is intricately and necessarily woven into the texture of a work. Thus, character expresses and is expressive of style, content, themes, imagery and ultimately is the purveyor of the intellectual and emotional rhythms of the author’s vision. From this viewpoint, character becomes a viable and even necessary focus for serious literary criticism and teaching. Character, seen as the driving force in fiction, as the purveyor of intellectual and emotional rhythms in the work, thus typifies the mimetic view of literature which sees no final discontinuity between a reader’s responses to art and to life. Within a mimetic perspective, a reader does not merely have a reading experience; he is the reading experience and the work becomes the reader’s experience of it. 9 ’ W. J. Harvey, Character and the Novel (London: Chatto and Windus, 1965), p. 206. ’9To further clarify the mimetic view of the reading experience, it is worthwhile to cite a comment made about the ideas of existential psychologist, Harry S. Sullivan: What we are asked to accept [by Harry S. Sullivan] is that in quite a real sense the self [reader] is one’s personal relationships. We have tended in the past to suppose that we are self-contained individuals looking out from a tower in our own private castle from which we proceed on periodic excursions in order to satisfy physical, emotional and mental needs and desires. We assumed that our contacts with the world left us relatively untouched, the same person as before. In the opinion of Sullivan this is a complete fallacy.

The ToLigado Project Your School Interactive Newspaper is an interactive virtual learning environment conceived, developed, implemented and supported by researchers at the School of the Future Research Laboratory of the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Method. This virtual learning environment aims to motivate trans-disciplinary research among public school students and teachers in 2,931 schools equipped with Internet-access computer rooms. Within this virtual community, students produce collective multimedia research documents that are immediately published in the portal. The project also aims to increase students’ autonomy for research, collaborative work and Web authorship. Main sections of the portal are presented and described. Results. Partial results of the first two years’ implementation are presented and indicate a strong motivation among students to produce knowledge despite the fragile hardware and software infrastructure at the time. Discussion. In this new environment, students should be seen as ‘knowledge architects’ and teachers as facilitators, or ‘curiosity managers’. The ToLigado portal may constitute a repository for future studies regarding student attitudes in virtual learning environments, students’ behaviour as ‘authors’, Web authorship involving collective knowledge production, teachers’ behaviour as facilitators, and virtual learning environments as digital repositories of students’ knowledge construction and social capital in virtual learning communities.

Based on a sample of 993 online health information seekers in India, the survey found that online health information seeking offers individuals greater autonomy, competence, and relatedness compared to face-to-face office visits with physicians. According to self-determination theory, individuals are motivated to act by a sense of volition and experience of willingness, validation of one’s skills and competencies, and feeling of connection with others who shaped one’s decisions. These 3 psychological needs, which motivate individuals to pursue what they innately seek as human beings, help explain why individuals turn online for health information. T tests showed that all 3 self-determination theory constructs -autonomy, competence, and relatedness-were higher for online health information seeking than for face-to-face office visits with physicians. A regression analysis found that 2 variables, autonomy and relatedness, explained online health information seeking. Competence was not a significant factor, likely because of competency issues faced by individuals in interpreting, understanding, and making use of online health information. The findings, which do not suggest that online health information seeking would displace physicians as many have feared, offer promise for an integrated system of care. Office visits with physicians would necessarily evolve into an expanded communicative space of health information seeking instead of an alternative channel for health information."

There are many things nurses must learn in order to do this; they learn to make specific observations about the progress of labor, and the well-being of mother and infant, they learn specific activities which provide comfort to the mother, they teach and reinforce earlier knowledge about the birth process, breathing and relaxation techniques, and so on. One kind of nursing skill, needed in many areas in which nurses function, may be developed particularily well in this area. This is the minute-by-minute assessment of the patient’s state, and adaptation of nursing care to this. A surgical patient may move from self-sufficient independence, to helplessness, to gradually regained autonomy over a period of days or weeks. The obstetrical patient may pass through these stages in a matter of hours. Thus the nurse must operate on the basis of the patient’s behavior, as she sees it, at any point in time; she cannot make a plan of care and follow it for a long period. Rather, she has certain objectives relating to safety, well-being, comfort, physiological stability and so on, but she must continually make adaptations in ways of trying to attain these. Picture a hypothetical patient who arrives in the labor room in early labor. She is full of energy, talkative, happy. She is aware of what is going on in her body, and interested in observing her own progress. She times her own contractions, chats with her husband and the nurses, perhaps knits, walks about, telephones friends. She has"

Autonomy has many interpretations in terms of the field within which it is being used and analyzed, but the majority of the researchers in artificial environments are arguing in favor of a strong and life-like notion of autonomy. Departing from this point the main aim of this paper is to examine the possibility of the emergence of autonomy in contemporary artificial agents. The theoretical findings of research in the areas of living and cognitive systems, suggests that the study of autonomous agents should adopt a systemic and emergent perspective for the analysis of the evolutionary development of the notions/properties of autonomy, functionality, intentionality and meaning, as the fundamental and characteristic properties of a natural agent. An analytic indication of the functional emergence of these concepts and properties is provided, based on the characteristics of the more general systemic framework of second-order cybernetic and of the interactivist framework. The notion of emergence is a key concept in such an analysis which in turn provides the ground for the theoretical evaluation of the autonomy of contemporary artificial agents with respect to the functional emergence of their capacities. The fundamental problems for the emergence of genuine autonomy in artificial agents are critically discussed and some design guidelines are provided."

Among different identity management models, only the federated one is able to ensure a strong protection in terms of trust and privacy. In fact, the participants in the federation decide to trust each other about which information can be exchanged in the processes of authentication and authorisation, based on established policies to manage relationships of trust. According to this, it has been widely adopted during the last years. In particular, its adoption in Public Administration allows a proper organisation autonomy, supporting access to the services offered by the institution. This process is going to quickly raise with the progressive adoption of cloud computing by Public Administrations. In the paper, two projects accomplishing federated digital identity in Italian Public Administrations are presented. Starting from lessons learned, authors highlight a path forward for Public Administration toward federated digital identity in cloud computing scenario."

Others are looking for specialised information, by curiosity, to complement the information received in medical visits or, more rarely, as a result of a lack of information in their exchanges with professionals. Uses of internet by patients will develop in the future and it is important that professionals take into account these different forms of internet use in their practices."

Social network sites, online games, video-sharing sites, and gadgets such as iPods and mobile phones are now fixtures of youth culture. They have so permeated young lives that it is hard to believe that less than a decade ago these technologies barely existed. Today’s youth are struggling for autonomy and identity as did their predecessors, but they are doing so amid new worlds for communication, friendship, play, and self-expression. This paper seeks to provide empirical data on the impact of the mobile technology on the social life of Indian youth. Taking a survey of some 1200 young Indians, the paper discovers their dependency on this new medium."

Burstein \nThe majority of the extensive debate surrounding posthumous sperm procurement (PSP) focuses on how to respect the deceased man and his autonomy. Policy and law also focus on the deceased’s interests, specifying the level of consent required. This article argues (using four hypothetical fact situations) that consent should not be the sole focus of ethical debate. Instead, a fuller picture should be examined, including the wishes and values of the prospective sperm donor; the future life and prospects of the resultant child; the needs and motivations of the mother, and other pertinent factors. In practice, this means that a committee acting judicially should consider each case. This is a practical option for New Zealand and Australia where applications for posthumous sperm procurement are not common but it also enables us to consider the ethical arguments in relation to such determinations in other jurisdictions."

When starting college, students get greater autonomy over their behaviors and responsibility for their own health, which creates a number of health-related information needs. As a result of this newly acquired autonomy, students also frequently engage in various risky behaviors, putting their well-being in jeopardy. This study aimed to answer whether the self-reported frequency in which students engage in risky behaviors and their enrollment in health-related courses affect how frequently they obtain health-related information. A novel aspect of this study is that it incorporated both intentional and opportunistic information acquisition. An analysis of online survey responses from 810 undergraduates attending a mid-western U.S. university showed that the frequency of their engagement in risky behaviors (e.g., the use of substances and alcohol and engagement in high-risk sexual activities) is not significantly associated with the frequency of neither intentional nor opportunistic health information acquisition on the Internet. However, students enrolled in health-related courses more frequently obtain health information by both intentional search and opportunistic discovery. This opportunistic style of was often described in the literature using terms such as passive, unintentional, accidental, serendipitous, encountering or acquiring by chance. The study findings provide valuable directions for librarians and health educators on how to design new and improve existing e-health literacy instructions to better suit students’ current needs and information behavior patterns."

The increase in geriatric care requests are overburdening specialized institutions that cannot cope with the demand for support. Patients are forced to have to remain at their homes encumbering the spouse or close family members with the caregiver role. This caregiver is not always physically and technically apt to assist the bedridden person with his/her meals and hygiene/bath routine. Consequently, a solution to assist caregivers in these tasks is of the utmost importance. This paper presents an approach for supporting caregivers when moving and repositioning Bedridden Elderly Peoples (BEPs) in home settings by means of a mechatronic system inspired by industrial conveyers. The proposed solution is able to insert itself underneath the patient, due to its low-profile structural properties, and retrieve and reallocate him/her. Ideally, the proposed mechatronic system aims to promote autonomy by reducing handling complexity, alter the role of the caregiver from physically handler of the BEP to an operator/supervisor role, and lessen the amount of effort expended by caregivers and BEPs alike."

Chawla \nKenyans use mobile money services to transfer money to friends and relatives via mobile phone text messaging. Kenya’s M-Pesa is one of the most successful examples of digital money for financial inclusion. This article uses social network analysis and ethnographic information to examine ties to and through women in 12 mobile money transfer networks of kin, drawn from field data collected in 2012, 2013, and 2014. The social networks are based on reciprocal and dense ties among siblings and parents, especially mothers. Men participate equally in social networks, but as brothers and mother’s brothers more often than as fathers. The matrilineal ties of mobile money circulate value within the hearthhold (Ekejiuba 2005) of women, their children, and others connected to them. Using remittances, families negotiate investments in household farming or work, education, and migration. Money sending supports the diverse economic strategies, flexible kinship ties, and mobility of hearthholds. Gifts of e-money are said to express a natural love and caring among mothers and siblings and are often private and personal. Consequently, the money circulations of the hearthhold avoid disrupting widely shared ideals of patrilineal solidarity and household autonomy."

The concept linking these two streams of discussion is that of ‘user autonomy’, which is implicated by the Internet’s affordances for individuals, and which, it is argued, should also be the legal and regulatory framework’s goal when governing Internet matters. However, the trends influencing EU law and regulation from the 1980s, especially neoliberalism, have resulted in these frameworks - competition law, sector-specific regulation, data protection and fundamental rights - not being well-equipped to advance user autonomy in the Internet sphere."

The universities were given ample autonomy to implement this goal, so that subjects not yet included in the curricula, such as Evidence-based Medicine (EbM), could now be integrated in the study course. Hence, in 2003 the Medical Faculty of the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, Frankfurt/Germany implemented (as first institution) a mandatory clinical training in EbM for third-year medical students. The content and structure of the seminar are based on the “Curriculum EbM” of the German Network of Evidence-Based Medicine. This project is conducted exclusively by intern medical students with previous training in teaching skills and specific knowledge. The seminar is integrated in the interdisciplinary field “Epidemiology, biostatistics, and informatics”. The four-day seminars consist of lectures and small-group teaching based on Internet search of medical information as well as on the critical appraisal of studies that deal with therapeutic and diagnostic problems; the self-evaluation of the information-retrieval process is also included. Special importance is attached to the need of scrutinising published medical information. The grades are based on seminar-oriented tests as well as on end-of-term examinations. The Frankfurt project shows that EbM can be easily implemented in medical undergraduate courses."

In this way, technology helps much in learning a language. This paper explores the autonomy as more than preference or strategy by the learner; it must be supported in a systematic way by the teacher and the curriculum for the learner to benefit. The characteristics of successful autonomous learner are explained followed by some examples that shown that learners have in common are that their attitudes were developed after they made their own decision for themselves that exclusively studying in the classroom environment was not enough. The paper also emphasis on technology approaches in developing learner autonomy, especially by using the computer and the internet. Newer technology, particularly the latest online systems, however, allows sound, movement, interactivity (for exercises, demonstrations, online discussion, etc), and the incorporation of genuine material for learning.

Networks allowed the multinational enterprise to operate globally. The Internet improved scientific collaboration, fueled e-commerce, and connected seven billion persons around the world with Massive Online Open Courses (MOOC) and gaming. But there is a dark side to ICT. Employment is destroyed. Artificial intelligence (AI) is replacing humans in white collar jobs and being deployed in warfare. The “Dark Web” is facilitating criminal syndicates and terrorism. Privacy and individual autonomy has been lost forever. An accelerating cyber arms race threatens transportation, finance, electricity, and communication infrastructures. Further growth of ICT will not stop. We will see both good and bad consequences downstream."

Conceptions of autonomy, vulnerability, responsibility, and care as well as corresponding personal experiences build the background of such anticipative decision-making.  Aim From May 2015 on the project, as a part of the interdisciplinary Bavarian research group ForGenderCare, will study the role of gender-specific beliefs and perceptions of autonomy, responsibility and vulnerability in anticipative decision-making in the final phase of life. Taking the German debate about living wills as an example, the project aims at exposing and comparing patterns of argumentation in the medico-ethical professional literature, advice literature and the media, among professional advisors and the population in Bavaria. The poster will present the project outline including hypotheses and preliminary results. Methods Debates on living wills take place at different levels. Therefore, platform-adapted methodologies have to be developed including desk analysis, qualitative interviews with professionals, group discussions with families, standardised content analyses of mass media, and qualitative content analyses of relevant online platforms. Relevance and practical aim The project will develop personalised counselling-models for planning living wills. Discussion As human existence oscillates between autonomy and dependence, we analyse four public and private areas that contribute to the current discussions in different ways: a) within the academia, b) in hospitals, c) in families, d) in mass media and also in specialised internet platforms. This holistic approach allows a deeper understanding of the debates on living wills in times of medicalization of life."

Lundberg \nIf we had an ideal healthcare system, how would we know that it was ideal? Nothing pleases everyone. No one lives forever. No person is perfect; nor would a reformed healthcare system be perfect. What is as good as we can reasonably expect? During an earlier phase of this long debate, I determined that there were 11 key elements to use to judge a health system and that they could be equally weighted on a 1- to 9-point scale, with 9 points at the top.[1] So, a nearly perfect system would total 11 times 9, or 99. The 11 characteristics were the following: Does the health system provide access for all to basic care? Does it produce real cost control? Does it promote continuing quality, reduce administrative hassle and cost, enhance disease prevention, encourage primary care, consider long-term care, retain necessary patient and physician autonomy, limit professional liability, and possess staying power? Some 10 years ago when I graded the various reforms then being proposed, the US system graded at 55; the Clinton Plan graded at 70; the Stark Congressional markup of it got the top score at 72; the Republican leadership plan graded at 47.[2] Of course, no organized reform occurred and things just got worse. I grade the 2005 American system at 52. I give the “Medicare for All” plan that I recently suggested a grade of 73 and the “Kaiser Permanente America” concoction a 76.[3] Next time, my proposed reforms. That’s my opinion.

This activity often increases their anxiety and confusion. Cyberchondria refers to the resulting match with real or imagined symptoms, and may lead to unnecessary medical consultation. Advantages of online searching include knowledge, empowerment, autonomy and self-responsibility. Disadvantages are increased fears and possible misinformation and misdiagnosis and inappropriate self-treatment. There is also loss of placebo-style trust in, and concordance with, professionals, who may experience reduced confidence, authority and effectiveness. However, a new and more collaborative style of consultation has developed, with the practitioner confirming or refuting information rather than protecting it."

Applications of information technology, particularly the Internet, make contacts possible even when spoken communication is impossible. Successful communication will support the personal autonomy of a severely disabled person and also relieves the anxiety of the family members, especially at the final stage of a progressive disease. Thorough elucidation of the user’s needs and finding the most appropriate solution for communication and association is essential."

Undoubtedly, all that is opening a new age with more information and autonomy for each individual, but the point is if these apps are accessible for the whole population. And when we talk about accessibility in an App, we are not only considering if the user is able to switch it on or unfold it main menu, we consider interface aspects that can present difficulties for some users. This study analyzes accessibility and usability of 15 Apps for people with visual dysfunction, because this difficulty has the greatest influence on the effective and efficient use of them. Data are collected through a descriptive scale made by a deductive-inductive process on four categories with a wide use of Apps. Social and specifically social-networking category is the largest consider accessibility on their apps, being highly demand by users and cost-effective for companies. Other categories are evaluated as completely inaccessible by users."

It consists of greater access to knowledge and resources, greater autonomy in decision-making to enable them to have greater ability to plan their lives or to have greater control over the circumstances that influence their lives and free from shocks imposed on them by custom, belief and practice. The status of the women is connected with their economic position or status which depends on their participation in economic activities such as ability to access credit, role in decision-making in financial matters and others. Social or domestic empowerment is a gradual process. Some variables had been selected to assess the impact of social empowerment among the informants in this paper, for example independent movement, expression of own view, undertaking decisions in familial matters, interaction with public bodies, participation in protest against social crimes and so on. The present qualitative has been conducted in the villages Amlani and Takipur of North 24 Parganas, West Bengal. The study is based on typical anthropological methodology under the domain of ethnographic approach. The contextual data have been collected through participant observations, intensive interviews and case studies. The data from books, journals, magazines and internet websites have also been utilised."

With the emergence of DTT (Digital Terrestrial Television) in Spain television networks, public and private, they have created new thematics channels focused on content for children. At the same time, with the rise of new electronic devices such as tablets and smartphones, they have moved such content to the network by creating of platforms whose programs are aimed childhood. The non-linearity and immediacy in consumption make the Internet becomes an active mean giving autonomy and freedom to access a multitude of content regardless of time and the device. In this situation the child consumers is the audience that worries both parents and educational institutions. Restless, therefore, that children do not find programs adjusted to their age. The quality concept harbors no concrete definition because of the multitude of factors and perspectives that influence it. This paper, and based on different measurement criteria set by countries like Argentina, Chile, Spain, France, Italy, Japan, Sweden, the University of Pennsylvania (USA) or the ACTF (Australian Children´s Television Foundation) poses as main objective to analyze the online platforms Clan RTVE, Neox Kidz and Boing of television TVE, Antena 3 and Telecinco, respectively, because they are considered spaces with audiovisual material created for children. With the intention of demonstrating that they are presented as quality environments for children who access them it will conduct a qualitative methodology. Using the content analysis technique to each of the animated titles we can say that the cartoons, as outlined above, are quality entertainment programs."

By othering, it means any linguistic-discursive action by which an individual or group is classified as “not one of us” (difference and strangeness). Considering that the construction of the Other is made up of social action; has an ideological component; and that an exercise of power is always present, the aim herewith is to show that othering processes in focused interactions instantiate overlaps, interceptions and  tangencies between different space-temporal scales which constitute the contemporary Brazilian “reality”. Observational data from a research project carried out since 2005 about internet-mediated interactions among Brazilians will be used to illustrate the contentions put forth in this paper.

Web-based autonomous learning, based on humanism and constructivism, has combined autonomous learning and internet technology, and opened up a new path to college English learning. Mastering English is even more important for engineering students whose native language is not English, as many engineering graduates encounter difficulties in their English-related work. Most scientific papers or journals globally are written in English. Most engineering graphs are also marked in English. To prepare engineering students for their future careers and life-long study, research is conducted in this paper to investigate the current situation of web-based autonomous English learning of engineering students in particular and current problems in their process of learning. Based on research findings, possible solutions and suggestions are proposed to solve the problems and improve students’ autonomy in English learning."

We undertook in-depth interviews with five leading teachers, and analyzed logs of interactions in order to identify teaching practices combining social networks. One teacher considerably strengthened her traditional teaching practices to control students according to a pedagogical approach of transmission of knowledge. We found that four teachers fostered social learning, autonomy and active engagement among their students. They thereby fostered the constitution of a learning community - of inquiry, or a moral community, through the use of social network sites. Additionally, we identified the distinctive role of social networks in contributing to the students’ learning to be part of their community. We examined five Israeli leading teachers who use social networks in their classes.Four teachers were found to foster social learning, autonomy and active learning.The fifth teacher used FB to strengthen traditional teaching practices.SNSs help students learning to be members of communities for better or for worse.With SNSs, leading teachers become potential agents of educational change."

Based on a study of the Chilean student movement during the 2013 electoral campaign in that country, the article offers an analysis of how Facebook is used by the three student federations that make up the movement. The results suggest informative and organizational aspects take priority in the use of social networks in that context. This trend is mediated by the peculiarities of the movement – the presence of traditional student organizations – and by and the complexity of the relationship with institutional policy, particularly the defense of autonomy against the risks of cooptation, increased by the passage of former leaders of the movement to the latter. The inclination for these spaces to be used more and more at times of increased social mobilization is confirmed, and the tensions between their use by organized collective action (student federations) and by the individuals participating in that action are shown.DOI: 10.5294/pacla.2016.19.3.6"

In this article, we will see how the use of a computer game proves to be a vector of a first transference address from the psychotic to the clinician. Therefore, the virtual will be studied through the magnifying glass of the pathology, revealing a function of « emergence » specific to cybernetics. This function is triple. Firstly, this contingency loads the emergence promises, allowing the user to expect from the machine anything but, and much more than, it is able to deliver. Secondly, this emergence gives the machine the appearance of autonomy, which helps the patient to delude himself into not considering himself as the origin of his representations. Lastly, this generator of representations enables the symptom by giving it a form, thus processing what Freud called a « force of healing drive » preparing the way for a transference relation."

Usually, the amount of generated information in such forums is very huge, multidimensional (in alignment with the desirable preconditions for constructivist knowledge creation), and sometimes, the nature of expected new information may not be anticipated in advance. Thus, concept maps (crafted from constructed data) as summary tools may be a solution to improve critical thinking and learning by making connections between the facts or knowledge shared by the participants during online discussion This exploratory paper begins with the description of this innovation tried on a web-based interacting platform (email list management software), FAIMER-Listserv, and generated qualitative evidence through peer-feedback. This process description is further supported by a theoretical construct which shows how social constructivism (inclusive of autonomy and complexity) affects the conversational learning. The paper rationalizes the use of concept map as mid-summary tool for extracting information and further sense making out of this apparent intricacy."

Questionnaires were distributed to the 252 participants and follow-up in-depth interviews were undertaken with a number of participants. Meanwhile, the teacher as a researcher conducted the action research project in order to understand how the use of modern technology and the Internet enhanced English proficiency of learners, especially their listening and speaking abilities. Additionally, some invaluable data were collected from interviews with participants and learning diaries on their experiences in using advanced technology. The research results demonstrate that: 1) One of the most important roles for language teachers is to motivate students to learn English, and to teach them correct learning strategies and learning methods; 2) Learner autonomy plays a crucial role in learning English; 3) The combination of the use of autonomy and advanced technology, such as computers and the Internet, helps learners improve their English language proficiency, and is considered to be one of the most effective ways to learn a language. Finally, this paper concludes with some implications and suggestions on English language teaching and learning by the use of the new media."

De Jonge \nWork overload or work pressure may undermine workers’ intrinsic motivation. In the present research, we tested the conditions under which this may (not) occur, including the perceived opportunity to blend on-site and off-site working through the effective use of computers and modern information and communication technology. Our sample consisted of 657 workers (51% female) representing a variety of industries. As hypothesized, it is not high job demands per se, but high demands in combination with a high need for autonomy and a lack of perceived opportunities for blended working that undermines intrinsic work motivation. When workers high in need for autonomy perceived opportunities for blended working, their intrinsic work motivation was not negatively affected by increasing job demands. This main finding suggests that, particularly for workers high in need for autonomy, the perceived opportunity for blended working is an effective, contemporary resource to cope with the increasing job demands typically observed in today’s workplace. Theoretically, these findings contribute to the refinement and extension of influential demands-resource models and Person-Job Fit theory. Practically, our findings may show managers how to effectively keep workers intrinsically motivated and productive in their jobs when job demands are high. We tested conditions under which high job demands may undermine work motivation.We examined the new concept of perceived opportunity for blended working.Blended working, enabled through ICTs, works when need for autonomy is high.High job demands per se do not undermine intrinsic work motivation.We emphasize the importance of fit between work context and workers’ needs."

This study investigates this issue using the self-determination theory (SDT). The SDT identifies three fundamental human psychological needs, namely the need for competence, autonomy, and relatedness. This study aims to answer the question of how the satisfaction of these needs motivates users to produce UGC and utilizes the multi-study model comparison approach. Two survey studies were conducted in China and the United States. The partial least squares (PLS) analyses confirmed that the SDT indeed explained UGC motivation significantly and that trust beliefs support people’s need for relatedness. Post hoc analyses showed that there were significant differences between Chinese and American culture. Those results make important contributions to theory and practice. For example, practitioners need to motivate users to produce UGC by supporting their psychological needs. Besides, different trust beliefs should …"

The paper starts with an introduction of the problem definition followed by an explanation of theoretical foundations of complexity in production, autonomy and cyber-physical production systems. In addition, selected already existing methods to master complexity are presented. The second part of the paper starts with an introduction into measuring the degree of autonomy in production processes which is the basis for the following simulation-based analysis. Afterwards, the simulation environment is presented. The third chapter is about the experimental analysis of the presented research question. Therefor, the experimental set up and the implementation are presented. The paper ends with an outlook on further evaluation activities."

However, an emerging stream of research demonstrates that the adoption of such technologies is accompanied by increasing stress, collective control and work intensification. This article provides a discussion of recent research on the effects of smartphone usage in contemporary organizational life. Generally, this research presents a contradiction between, on the one hand, the discourse on technologies as a means to enhance individual autonomy and competence and, on the other hand, the de facto incorporation of technology users in networks of control and an unhealthy work culture of permanent connectivity. Finding inspiration in the work of Slavoj Žižek and his development of psychoanalytical concepts, this article offers an alternative approach to this issue. It does so by reconsidering how to understand employee subje…"

Despite the nurses’ important role in end-of-life care, their perceptions of death are underrepresented in the literature. This study explores Finnish nurses’ varied conceptions of a good death with a qualitative design. Nurses (n = 82), recruited via social media, completed a Web-based questionnaire about a good death. Data were collected in April 2014 and analyzed inductively with a phenomenographic, 7-step analysis method. The autonomy and human dignity of the dying person were highlighted in the study results as key features of a good death. Four categories of description emerged from the data: respect of one’s autonomy and human dignity, attributes of a good death, preparation for death, and contextual aspects of a good death. The findings demonstrate the broad variation in nurses’ conceptions of a good death. Nurses will be better able to provide individualized and high-quality end-of-life care with knowledge about the various existing conceptions of a good death. Future research should explore the extent to which nurses’ conceptions of a good death are realized during provision of end-of-life care by nurses in different health care settings."

Quality improvement and development of education thus become strategic issues for any local government. This study aims to address issues related to: (1) the condition of school facilities and infrastructure (2) the role of school committees which is not optimal; (3) the absence of equitable distribution of teachers; and (4) the lack of Information and Communication Technology/ICT-based learning application in in secondary schools. The research was conducted in four districts, namely Bangkalan, Sampang, Pamekasan and Sumenep. The main theory employed in this study is the School Based Management (SBM) or the so-called School Based Management (SBM). The population was students, parents and teachers. The total number of samples was 250 people comprising 100 students, 100 parents and 50 teachers. The research data were obtained from primary and secondary data. The study yielded a number of key findings. First, 90% of High School (or its equivalent) teachers master the materials taught. This is due to fact that the materials taught are in accordance with the education qualification of the teacher. Secondly, the mismatch found in Madurese high schools was apparently caused by the lack of educators with suitable qualification for the subjects they teach concurrently. Almost all secondary teachers in Madura island require trainings related to the development of competency for mastering the subject materials. The last but not the least, the majority of teachers still apply simple learning methods. Although the method applied by teachers are generally similar, there are significant differences between the favorite schools and the other schools."

Gleibs \nNew technologies like large-scale social media sites (e.g., Facebook and Twitter) and crowdsourcing services (e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk, Crowdflower, Clickworker) are impacting social science research and providing many new and interesting avenues for research. The use of these new technologies for research has not been without challenges, and a recently published psychological study on Facebook has led to a widespread discussion of the ethics of conducting large-scale experiments online. Surprisingly little has been said about the ethics of conducting research using commercial crowdsourcing marketplaces. In this article, I focus on the question of which ethical questions are raised by data collection with crowdsourcing tools. I briefly draw on the implications of Internet research more generally, and then focus on the specific challenges that research with crowdsourcing tools faces. I identify fair pay and the related issue of respect for autonomy, as well as problems with the power dynamic between researcher and participant, which has implications for withdrawal without prejudice, as the major ethical challenges of crowdsourced data. Furthermore, I wish to draw attention to how we can develop a “best practice” for researchers using crowdsourcing tools."

To this end, 63 intermediate EFL learners were questionnaired to express their beliefs about the use of Facebook and to assess their views on the improvement of language skills and motivation in English language learning, fostering their metacognitive confidence, attitudes and sense of autonomy towards English language learning. The research revealed that applying Facebook by learners improves their language skills and promotes their sense of autonomy."

In developed countries, the profitability motivation has imposed Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) in enterprises as a better way to design information systems capable of taking into account inter-organizational cooperation mechanisms while preserving autonomy of the latter. Those Service-Oriented Architectures did not stop at the doors of public administrations. Thus, several specifications have been made to adapt them to the peculiarities of public governance. But these models are not always able to respond effectively to the concerns of governments in developing countries particularly when they are structurally and territorially decentralized. Therefore, we propose a more suitable model to this type of e-governance. We will later see how our model can be more suitable for the organization of remote and secured fairground courts in Cameroon to address constraints related to finance, time and security that these courts currently impose."

With this in mind, a Spanish-Finnish task-based project was designed to examine how students perceived their cultural exchange via Facebook and the extent to which such online interactions assisted them in becoming autonomous learners. Nineteen Spanish and seventeen Finnish participants were provided with the opportunity to interact with each other outside the classroom with a view to exploring the target culture and, consequently, experiencing intercultural learning. The findings suggest that the learning experience was positive and that the participants felt motivated to examine each other’s cultural traits and manage their own learning tasks. Sharing information and reciprocally exchanging views on comments are paramount in developing skills to become independent learners."

Яковлева \nThe paper analyzes the effects that occur in the process of the educational environment informatization. The following effects were analyzed: information richness, openness, individualization of learning and collaboration. Examples of educational practice, illustrating the significant changes of the university educational environment associated with the manifestation of these effects, are presented. The aim of the pilot study carried out in Herzen University was to identify the attitude to the listed effects of teachers and students who are using information and communication technology in the educational interactions. The leading method of study were a series of surveys addressed to teachers and students. Groups of questions were related to basic information effects, manifested in the educational environment of the university. The total number of the survey participants is 200 students (bachelors and masters) and 100 teachers, most actively using electronic environment for research, education and professional activities. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the results showed that information richness, spatial and temporal freedom of educational interactions are demanded by students, but at the same time, the data indicated a lack of systematic pedagogical support for the information and educational activities of students. A large part of students show a high autonomy in the information educational environment, but also demands implementing individualized information and communication educational request. Students and teachers are actively using a variety of information and communication opportunities of the electronic environment, but students’ activeness in the electronic environment is largely determined by the recommendations of teachers, rather than by a free choice of educational opportunities. The participants of the educational environment acquire a significant degree of freedom in relation to the time and place of interaction with educational resources, but evidence suggests that educational activities in the electronic environment is not sufficiently focused on expanding the range of educational opportunities and preparing students for continual self-improvement of knowledge and skills. As the conclusions, we note the need to improve both the corporate strategy of the university electronic environment development and the competences of educational interactions in the extended information and communication space. This will reveal the full potential of e-learning environment and provide greater guarantees for obtaining high-quality educational outcomes. For teachers are in demand special competences, providing the possibility of forming a diverse and adaptive media environment for saturated solution of educational problems in accordance with university policies, introduction of e-learning and global education trends. For students, come to the fore the competences which help to improve their information culture and individual requests for the use of a variety of educational opportunities available in the electronic space. These ideas are fully consistent with the demanded by modern society the lifelong learning strategy."

The research was carried out with the participation of 110 learners at Distance Education University in Urmia, Iran. Questionnaires were emailed to the participants. Results of statistical analyses revealed substantial correlations between learners’ conceptions of autonomy and their emotional intelligence. ‘Independence’, ‘Stress Tolerance’, ‘Problem- Solving’, ‘Happiness’, ‘Self-actualization’, ‘Self-awareness’, ‘Optimism’, ‘Self-regard’, ‘Empathy,’ and ‘Impulse Control’ became the most determining elements of emotional intelligence (EI) for learners. Overall, the findings led the researcher to conclude that learners’ EI is a key factor influencing the extent to which they are ready to learn autonomously, and that teachers could therefore strive to ascertain learners’ intelligence type before they train them to become autonomous."

    "text": "Doc 733 :  How Can Polycentric Governance of Spectrum Work \nhttps://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2756667\n Martin B. H. Weiss \n Prashant Krishnamurthy \n Marcela Gomez \nSpectrum policy in the US (and throughout most of the world) consists generally of a set of nationally determined policies that apply uniformly to all localities. However, it is also true that there is considerable variation in the features (e.g., traffic demand or population density), requirements and constraints of spectrum use on a local basis. Global spectrum policies designed to resolve a situation in New York City could well be overly restrictive for communities in central Wyoming. At the same time, it is necessary to ensure that more permissive policies of central Wyoming would not create problems for NYC (by ensuring, for example, that relocated radios adapt to local policies). Notions of polycentric governance that have been articulated by the late E. Ostrom argue that greater good can be achieved by allowing for local autonomy in resource allocation. Shared access to spectrum is generally mediated through one of several technologies. As Weiss, Altamimi and Liu show, approaches mediated by geolocation databases are the most cost effective in today’s technology. In the database oriented Spectrum Access System, or SAS, proposed by the FCC, users are granted (renewable) usage rights based on their location for a limited period of time. Because this system grants usage rights on a case-by-case basis, it may also allow for greater local autonomy while still maintaining global coordination. For example, it would be technically feasible for the database to include parameters such as transmit power, protocol, and bandwidth. Thus, they may provide the platform by which polycentric governance might come to spectrum management. In this paper, we explore, through some case examples, what polycentric governance of spectrum might look like and how this could be implemented in a database-driven spectrum management system.The technical architecture envisions a geo-located and networked radio that controls the protocols and transmission parameters of the radios associated with it. This appliance (and the associated radios) might be owned and operated by a landlord, a farmer, an Internet service provider, etc. The operating parameters of the radios, such as power, bandwidth, protocols (e.g. waiting times in WiFi) would gradually become more permissive until an enforceable event occurred. At this point, the parameters would become more restrictive. Note that this is consistent with the notion of graduated sanctions of the CPR literature.Enforceable events would be resolved between appliances through an automated negotiation protocol. It may also involve fusing authenticated data regarding the enforceable event. If the frequency of enforceable events increased above a threshold, a super local (or regional) coordinating device would be invoked to optimize use of the spectrum. In this way, spectrum governance is nested, providing resilience against a single point of failure in the governance process.This represents a means to learn from the local knowledge and policy changes, which results in a system that is more responsive to environment threats at multiple scales. In the end, we have a system that can compensate for the failure of some units with the successful response of others. This can be an advantage with respect to global policy mechanisms. Thus spectrum management would be best modelled as an emergent phenomenon rather than a top down system. This paper will describe the key details of this system and present some initial modelling results in comparison with the traditional global model of spectrum regulation. It will also address some of the concerns with this approach."

The addition of much more computing power and object-bound data storage will lead to new possibilities for the advancement of autonomy in production systems. Autonomous message exchange and coordination can help to prevent quality problems (for instance wrong pairing of tool and work piece) and improve the disturbance management (for instance by faster information about current and probable disturbances). Due to the fact that nearly all improvements of existing production systems with cyber-physical systems take place in real and active manufacturing sites, on-site experiments for determining an appropriate degree of autonomy for production objects are not feasible. Therefore, a lab approach is necessary. In this contribution a hybrid lab approach to simulate various degrees of autonomy is presented [1] . The paper starts with a definition of autonomy and suggests diverse measurement methods [2] . After a short introduction into the lab concept, the results of some test runs are presented where autonomous objects perform the same production program as “dumb” production objects. Finally, an outlook for further research is given."

We constituted part of a group of university teachers who engaged in a kind of training teachers in service. In particular we were interested on the use of ICT in two senses: as a means of communication (Facebook) and as a teaching tool (GeoGebra). The work consisted on constructing a process of accompaniment to teachers of Mathematics at middle schools of four localities of Argentinean Patagonia. They were distributed in two groups of two schools each one. One group treated contents of algebra y the other one of functions. The process was to co-generate didactical cycles of three phases: priori analysis, commissioning classroom and posteriori analysis. In this presentation we pay attention to some aspects of the communicational use of the ICT which were made in the algebra group, with special focus in the produced levels of confidence and autonomy."

More particularly, a model is tested in which parental mediation styles and attention to internet advertising at school are related to conceptual and attitudinal advertising literacy in SNG and in which both advertising literacies in turn are related to behavioral intentions. Data were collected among 780 respondents (aged 10-14 years). After showing participants a video compilation of SNG Habbo, a questionnaire was given to the respondents addressing the abovementioned aspects. Results confirmed that autonomy-supportive restrictive mediation is positively associated with understanding selling intention, while autonomy-supportive active mediation is positively associated with understanding persuasive intention. In addition, attention to internet advertising at school is related to children’s understanding of persuasive intent. Critical attitude towards SNG advertising is negatively related to pester intention and intention to buy, while understanding persuasive intent is associated with a higher score on both intentions."

The article argues that the workplace level functions as a link between the macro level of external pressures and the micro level of perceived influences on news work. Using principal component analysis we explore the dimensionality of workplace autonomy based on a set of 20 survey questions. Regression analysis is then used on the dimensions found in order to determine what affects perception of autonomy in the different dimensions. The most salient explanatory variables are found on the country and organisational levels, whereas the variables age, experience, gender, managerial role and medium have no or limited effects. The results show the organisational and country levels being integrated and that national journalistic culture is the most salient factor explaining perception of autonomy."

Koch \n Julia Nafziger \nAbstract Cyberloafing – non-work related internet use – is a prominent problem in modern firms. While incomplete contracts typically rule out direct control of workers’ effort, many employers hope to increase productivity through ‘soft’ control, by restricting the private use of internet at work. In a lab experiment with real effort, we investigate how the temptation of the internet and a manager’s decision whether to restrict workers’ access to it affect the morale of workers. When tempted by internet access, workers reciprocate fair wages less than without access. Nevertheless, a manager’s decision to actively grant internet access might increase workers’ effort: we find that highly reciprocal workers perceive the autonomy such a policy gives as a gift which they reciprocate with high effort despite the temptation of the internet. For less reciprocal workers the temptation aspect dominates and restricting internet access is better for the manager."

The results revealed that teachers realize the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) as inherent in all spheres of their lives, occurring also an intensification of the workload and the need for them to discipline themselves. The organization of work in distance education requires a new way of structuring, in which there is increased control, which restricts the teaching autonomy; socio-professional relations mediated by ICTs make the work of distance education teachers lonelier but at the same time, require a multidisciplinary team to execute the teaching."

Nowadays many learners are keen to explore the wide variety of applications available in their portable and always readily available mobile phones and tablets. The fact that they are keen to take control of their learning and autonomy is thought to lead to greater motivation and engagement, and the link with games-based learning suggests that the fun factor involved should not be overseen. This paper focuses on the use of mobile applications for independent language learning in higher education. It investigates how learners use mobile apps in line with their classes to enhance their learning experience. We base our analysis on a survey carried out in autumn 2013 in which 286 credited and non-credited language students from various levels of proficiency at The University of Manchester express their perceptions on the advantages and disadvantages of the use of mobile applications for independent language learning, together with examples of useful apps and suggestions of how these could be integrated in the language class."

Harold \n Victoria A. Fitton \n Brian K. Ahmedani \nAbstract Adolescence is a time when youth are faced with multiple tasks that intersect and influence one another, e.g., increased desire for autonomy, salience of identity issues, peer orientation, self-focus and self-consciousness, and a continuing need for a safe environment in which to explore autonomy and identity. These all occur in a dynamic ecosystemic environment, which in the past would have mostly included family, peers, and school, but today also includes cyberspace as both a system, and a means to interact with many other systems through the use of multiple forms of information technology (IT). This paper uses the voices and experiences of 128 adolescents, captured in qualitative interviews, to look at autonomy and identity in the digital age as they talk about their parents vis a vis their use of IT. Thematic analysis revealed two major themes: 1) Adolescents spoke of their expertise. In particular they commented on their knowledge to repair equipment, ability to use IT well, their sense of pride in their own ability and their parents’ acknowledgement of this ability. 2) Subjects perceived little need for their own supervision, but assessed that other adolescents and younger children needed to be watched closely by their parents. Implications of this work are discussed."

First, the paper presents a mapping of online creation communities according to their infrastructure governance. The main axes of order in the infrastructure governance are open versus closes to community involvement in the provision organizing. Then, the other significant axes is knowledge policy which in term of infrastructure governance influences the level of freedom and autonomy of the collective action in regards to the infrastructure. According to these two axes five models of infrastructure governance resulted: corporate service, university network, representative foundations, mission oriented enterprises, and assamblearian selfprovision.Second, the research provides an empirical explanation of the governance models which are most likely to succeed in creating large-size collective action in terms of the dimensions of participation and complexity of collaboration.Infrastructure governance based on closeness to community involvement in the platform provision and for profit strategies generates bigger communities. Instead, open to community involvement and nonprofit generates smaller communities, even smaller if they are informal. Conditions which favor community freedom and autonomy generate smaller communities also, but interestingly, they resulted to be the conditions that increase collaboration among the participants."

A revelatory case identifies several IT control points by which the parent can still exert control over the affiliate. These controls separate the affiliate’s digital identity from the parent resulting in the perception of increased autonomy yet shifting the conception of control to a social form of self-regulation."

However, in the context of this study, we take OEP to include any practice that opens up a closed educational ecosystem by expanding learners’ social networks and by increasing learners’ participation and autonomy. Our study is framed in terms of one of the Research Hub’s guiding hypotheses: OER leads to critical reflection by educators, with evidence of improvement in their practice. In this case, the improved practice refers to how French-language educators sought to overcome prescriptivist attitudes linked to the monolingual orientation of traditional classroom instruction by adopting a translingual paradigm in keeping with recent research in applied linguistics (Cook, 1992, 1999; Blyth, 1995; MLA Report, 2007; Kramsch, 2010; Levine, 2011; Canagarajah, 2015). More precisely, we examine how language educators extended an titled Francais interactif (Blyth, 2009, 2012; Kelton, Guilloteau & Blyth, 2011) by creating an accompanying Facebook page as an online space (Gee, 2005) where traditionally proscribed practices such as code switching and lexical borrowing were not only accepted but encouraged. Following Canagarajah (2015), we understand translingual practice as an umbrella term referring to a language learner’s integrated repertoire of communicative strategies based on multiple languages and modalities. We examine the social dynamics of various translingual practices that routinely occur on the Francais interactif Facebook page and conclude by arguing that open, translingual affinity spaces provide an ideal place for raising learners’ critical language awareness."

The main idea behind open educational resources (OER) is providing freely accessible and openly licensed documents, which fits well with the online learning system using SNS. However, the gap between higher education and social network media in relation to shared activities and OER use remains a challenge. The main reason for this is that teachers lack knowledge of mutual assistance and the skills to use OER. Teachers are dissatisfied with having to use others’ resources, which indicates that the problem lies in teachers’ psychological conflicts and technical capabilities. Our learning platform, Creative Higher Education with Learning Objects (CHiLO), is based on e-textbooks and aims to develop a flexible learning environment. The CHiLO e-textbooks were developed with a completely new design that considered large-scale online courses, such as open online courses. The core component of CHiLO is the CHiLO Book, which is created in EPUB3 format and has media-rich contents, including graphics, animations, audios and embedded videos. Our set of experimental outcomes shows that CHiLO, which includes not only Web services but also e-textbooks, is easy for teachers to handle."

In the context of the 22 July 2011 terror attacks in Norway, social media use by citizens, and even victims, became an essential feature of reporting. Social media confronted the legacy media’s way of covering crisis events. It raised questions about traditional journalism’s ability to handle audience’s as, not only news consumers, but also producers. In the present article, we look at the ways in which the professional norms and values of traditional journalism are specifically challenged by social media use in times of terror, using the 22 July 2011 attacks as a case study. We find that Norwegian journalists initially held to their professional roles, and to the classic self-representational principles of journalism, including objectivity, autonomy and immediacy. When they integrated social media into their traditional platforms and modes of coverage, they framed it as a “source” of sorts. As the 22 July 2011 event cov…"

The study participants were enrolled in a three-week summer global media literacy program, at the end of which they were asked to complete an open-ended survey questionnaire, asking about the role digital media technologies and social media platforms have on journalism and its role in a participatory democracy. Results highlight a general negativity toward the growing influence of new media technologies in journalism with regard to objectivity, autonomy, balance, and depth, juxtaposed with the embrace of the same technologies in contributing to greater citizen participation, voice, and inclusion in journalism and news flow. This divide raises questions around the relationship between journalism, journalism education, and technology in the context of participatory citizenship. The study concludes by recommending a more integrative model for journalism education than presently followed that addresses the disjuncture evidenced in this study between professional notions of journalism and participatory citizenship in the digital age."

The purpose of this study is to understand the issues related to the implementation of blended-learning pedagogy. Existing theories in Distance education (DE) specifically interaction and communication theory proposed by Holmberg (1995), autonomy and independence theory based on the work Wedemeyer (1981) and Moore (1994) and community of inquiry (CoI) model contributed by Garrison, Anderson, and Archer (2000) are detected to provide a general picture on how practices in teaching-learning provisions and DE theories may inform each other. Qualitative case study was employed to optimize my understanding of the blended learning phenomena gathered through semi-structured interview and documentary analysis. Whilst they operated in different educational settings, these two universities shared similarities. They have developed blended learning pedagogy to promote students’ learning classified into three dimensions: printed learning materials, F2F sessions, and online learning. Printed materials, however, may be identified as a major one and online learning have been regarded as strategic policies for further development. They have been equipped with their VLE; the use of VLE helped these universities to provide two-way traffic communications. They have been involved in developing internet-based instruction to widening access and to meet challenges for better future."

This study uses a goal hierarchy approach to deepen our understanding of the relationship between the use of Facebook and psychological well-being (PWB) in young adults. The study applies a mixed-method design that combines means-end analysis and regression analysis to examine data collected from laddering interviews with 161 Facebook users. The means-end chain analysis provided knowledge of the hierarchical goal structure in Facebook (i.e., activitiesmediated goalsultimate goals). Regression analysis was used to identify the relationships between the ultimate goals of Facebook use (e.g., psychological stability, belongingness) and the dimensions of PWB (e.g., self-acceptance, autonomy). The findings explain the significant association of Facebook use with well-being and the dual outcomes of enjoyment (positive in SNS; negative in users lives). Prior research focused on relationships among abstract factors, but this study delivers a more specific and nuanced explanation of user behavior on SNSs by providing knowledge of how specific Facebook activities relate to goals and PWB."

The key contributions of this paper are the identification and description of seven dimensions of socio-cultural distance that caused several significant challenges in the courses: 1) language differences; 2) concept of time; 3) attitude toward grades; 4) assumptions about national culture; 5) differences in autonomy; 6) influence of the course lecturer; and 7) work habits. Recommendations from this paper that are expected to benefit GSEE educators and students include: cross-cultural orientation of students prior to the course; use of various strategies to support better comprehension of different English accents (e.g., speaking slowly, replaying recorded video messages, and text chatting); and educators familiarizing themselves and their students with the relevant GSE and GSEE literature."

The list is extracted from the relevant comparative researches focused on Belarus. After describing the regime as a set of rules for the media, the text then proceeds to the specific morphology of the Belarussian new media that do not comply with the basic characteristics proposed by media researchers and thus can be recognized as old media restructured to meet the ethics and principles of the Internet. Then the author deals with the agenda setting process in Belarus and proposes his own interpretation of the classical logistics of this process in specific Belarussian circumstances where the list of power-bearing actors is dramatically reduced. The paper is finalized with showing the new possibilities that the media as an actor of public policy have obtained in the agenda setting after appearance of Web 2.0 when sites the have been re-structured on the basis of the user-generated content which helps to retrieve the media’s autonomy and possibilities to influence the agenda setting.Key words: public policy theory, new media, agenda-setting process, political regimes"

This concept, however, involves elements that go beyond methodological issues regarding the acquisition of foreign languages in Web process - also encompasses social, political and gnostic issues. Therefore, we will try to explore the concept of autonomy applied to foreign languages teaching and learning process through the Internet, based on the principle that the autonomous individual can not be determined by other individuals, and even by technological devices, no matter how advanced they are. We will examine, however, to what extent the use of communication technology tools in the Web can contribute to the process of formation of autonomous and active individuals in their own process of acquiring a foreign language."

Blended learning represents an educational environment for much of the world where computers and the Internet are readily available. It combines self‑study with valuable face‑to‑face interaction with a teacher. This study puts the spotlight on learning outcomes in an English for Specific Purposes (ESP) class in Thailand in which e‑learning strategies are used in parallel with traditional classroom language teaching methods of the four language learning skills. These skills are listening, speaking, reading and writing. The achievements and attitudes of students were compared between the control group and the experimental group to measure the potential of available technology to develop language skills and learner autonomy. The findings from this study show that online practice is directly beneficial to enhance the four language learning skills as well as autonomous learning and learner motivation."

This article analyzes the content of those religions, as well as student reflections on them, in light of quantitative studies and original analysis of a sample of college students drawn from Wave 3 of the National Study of Youth and Religion. It finds that college students see themselves and their cohort as interested primarily in religions that revolve around three axes: tolerance and inclusivity, moral and intellectual autonomy, and this-worldly happiness. These findings suggest that a synthesis of literature on the life course and on American moral culture provides the best analytical framework for viewing American college student approaches to religion and spirituality."

It is a fear that has the potential to restrict children’s autonomy and opportunities for engagement in social media. Fear regarding children’s online activities is one of the issues surrounding children’s Internet safety that does not appear to be situated in any particular social or cultural context. Among the most popular means of monitoring children online, censorware may prove even more harmful to children’s socioemotional wellbeing and development than any other form of monitoring (Boyd & Jenkins, 2006; Cloke & Jones, 2005; Helwig, 2006; Kamii, 1991; Laufer & Wolfe, 1977; Marx & Steeves, 2010; Pettit & Laird, 2002; Rooney, 2010). Inherent in the design and use of censorware are structures that inhibit children’s online and offline social interactions, their ability to develop fully as social actors, and their experience of being empowered to make informed and critical decisions about their lives, including choices relating to privacy. As well, reliance on surveillance-based approach-es to monitoring online activities of chil-dren (aged 5-14) may actually be leading to a greater danger: a decrease in oppor-tunities for children to have experiences that help them develop autonomy and independence. Our inquiry is located within a growing body of research that addresses the social implications of restricting, surveilling and controlling young children’s online activities versus nurturing individual autonomy through parental mentoring and critically reflec-tive software and social technology use."

Can a full-fledged right to privacy, the ability to exercise one’s autonomy, exist alongside the general interest, and depend neither on financial resources like in the United States nor on centralised government decisions or the medical hierarchy like in France? The contrast between these two modern democracies justify the importance of comparing them. I will demonstrate that overlaps do exist: the free exercise of religion and opinion, freedom of expression, the inherent value of each individual. What differs, however, are the institutions and how they provide, protect, promote, or frame access to and expressions of these democratic principles. The impact of the global economy, the exposure of people around the world to each other via the internet, and the mirror effects of social media, blogs, and other such forums, have created new perspectives that countries project onto one another. For example, does France now seem to tout ‘autonomy’ as a new and important value because it appears to be an ‘American success story’? Does the United States now seem to value human rights and a social-democratic approach because of the ‘French model’? There seems to be some truth behind these assertions, but as this article will demonstrate, the portrayals of what the ‘right to privacy’ is in the United States and what ‘socialised medicine’ is in France are not necessarily fully accurate."

For its engineering architects “if the Web was to be a universal resource, it had to grow in an unlimited way”, thus “its being ‘out of control’ was very important” (Berners-Lee and Fischetti, 1999). Yet, this simple deign choice has had a serious impact on conventional legal thinking. This paper highlights the importance of online decentralized architecture as the perfect substantiation of the autonomy rational underpinning the right to free speech.In doing so the paper analyses the core principles supporting the Internet’s architecture on their merit to the promote the user’s autonomy and self-realisation through speech. Following the free speech rationale for autonomy, it is observed how some simple engineering decisions for an open decentralised communicatory platform can build a user-centric ecology for speech. To validate this hypothesis two main architectural choices are examined as to the potential they hold for free speech: the principles of Modularity and End-to-End (E2E).The paper concludes that in terms of free speech, law and net architecture should be seen as complementing factors instead of opposite controlling deities. In this respect, Lessig’s mantra that “code is law” is paraphrased to read as “law encoded”, meaning that the law should strive to maintain the core architectural Internet values promoting human rights, and free speech in particular."

Using data from a survey of 240 internet-based sex workers (members of the National Ugly Mug reporting scheme in the UK), we discuss the working conditions of this type of work. We look at the basic working patterns, trajectories and everyday experiences of doing sex work via an online medium and the impact this has on the lives of sex workers. For instance, we look at levels of control individuals have over their working conditions, prices, clientele and services sold, and discuss how this is mediated online and placed in relation to job satisfaction. The second key finding is the experience of different forms of crimes individuals are exposed to such as harassment and blackmail via the new technologies. We explore the relationship internet-based sex workers have with the police and discuss how current laws in the UK have detrimental effects in terms of safety and access to justice. These findings are placed in the context of the changing landscape of sex markets as the digital turn determines the nature of the majority of commercial sex encounters. These findings contribute significantly to the populist coercion/choice political debates by demonstrating levels and types of agency and autonomy experienced by some sex workers despite working in a criminalized, precarious and sometimes dangerous context."

The sample consisted of 441 adolescents in physical education classes aged between 12 and 16 (Mage = 14.74, SD = .80), who responded to various questionnaires on perceived autonomy support, motivation in the education and leisure contexts, and intention to do exercise. The model was tested using a structural equation model.

Perceived autonomy support from family and peers was positively associated with motivation in leisure time, which in turn positively associated with the attitude and control standards. While the intention to practice physical activity was positively associated with the main concepts of the theory of planned behavior. Results are discussed in view of the importance of considering the importance of social models in the stage of adolescence, highlighting the role of promoting autonomy and their influence on inter-contextual motivation in physical exercise."

Against this background, this paper showed that African traditional religion can aid national development in Nigeria. This it does through its traditional ethical principles based on the communal concern for the well-being of all, principles founded not on the ethics of individualism, human autonomy and selfishness, but on a common unity-centered. These traditional ethical principles, sanctions and eschatological beliefs regulated the behaviour, conduct, and actions of individuals in African society. Ethical principles, sanctions and eschatological concepts were the factors that kept individuals and government in check. The paper also x-rayed how African traditional religion can play a vital role in the national development of contemporary Nigerian society through its ethical principles and practices. This argued that the moral salvation of Nigerians lie in their immediate and conscious return to traditional socio-religious values and morals system which is the foundation for genuine conscience and national development.

English Fun Dubbing, an APP designed for its users to practice oral English, was employed in this one-academic-year empirical study to evaluate the benefits of mobile APPs in the field of pedagogy. When the study ended, an anonymous online questionnaire was distributed to the 123 participants to survey the effects of English Fun Dubbing on their English language learning. The results showed that the majority of the respondents were satisfied with it in many aspects including its conveniences, flexibility, user-friendliness, rich materials, authentic language context, etc. and also its functions to inspire learning interests, foster learner autonomy, help realize personalized learning, and so on. We concluded that a reasonable and wise choice of APPs would not only be useful for students’ English learning, but also help lead them to use mobile phones in a positive way."

For instance, motor disabled people like wheelchair users may have problems to interact with the city. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies provide the tools to include all citizens in the Smart City context. For example, wheelchair users may not be able to reach items placed beyond their arm’s length, limiting their independence in everyday activities like shopping, or visiting libraries. We have developed a system that enables wheelchair users to interact with items placed beyond their arm’s length, with the help of Augmented Reality (AR) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technologies. Our proposed system is an interactive AR application that runs on different interfaces, allowing the user to digitally interact with the physical items on the shelf, thanks to an updated inventory provided by an RFID system. The resulting experience is close to being able to browse a shelf, clicking on it and obtaining information about the items it contains, allowing wheelchair users to shop independently, and providing autonomy in their everyday activities. Fourteen wheelchair users with different degrees of impairment have participated in the study and development of the system. The evaluation results show promising results towards more independence of wheelchair users, providing an opportunity for equality improvement."

Locke \nThis paper explores Buddhist images of the body, and in particularly the female body, as expressed in the Theragāthā and the Therīgāthā. In 1930 I. B. Horner argued that Buddhism brought women a level of equality, autonomy and respect unprecedented in pre-Buddhist India. Women gained control over their own lives and were no longer seen as chattel that could only live through and on a man. In Horner’s words, Buddhism not only challenged the caste system, “but also attempted to promote the cause of rights for women. While it is probably true that Buddhism offered women an outlet for self-expression which they otherwise would have found hard to find, it would be an exaggeration to claim that Buddhism championed women rights. From the beginning, the eight special rules for bhikkhunīs guaranteed that they would remain under the power of the bhikkhus. Furthermore, more recent research on women in Buddhism has highlighted that the Buddhist position toward women was both ambiguous and at times contradictory. On the one hand, women were seen as a danger to a man’s spiritual progress because of their perceived association with sensuality and procreation. On the other hand, Buddhism acknowledged that women were just as capable of achieving enlightenment as their male counterparts. The result was an attitude toward women which, while spiritually accepting, was at the same time infused with patriarchy and a male distrust of the feminine. Moreover, what the Theragāthā and the Therīgāthā suggest is that patriarchy was so pervasive in early Buddhism that the bhikkhunīs effectively adopted and internalized bhikkhus’ attitudes toward the female body."

Most of the educational approaches adopted in medical schools are directed towards developing more of competencies and less of capability, which is the ability to use competencies in novel contexts. Competencies alone are not sufficient to thrive in the present day work place as medical profession subsumes complex contexts; it is in this scenario that, medical educators are entrusted with the challenging task of developing “capable learners”. In the heutagogical approach, learners are required to decide upon what to learn and how to learn and therefore the control of the learning process is on the learner and the role of the teacher becomes that of a navigator. This paper highlights the current higher educational practices based on heutagogy, considers its application in the context of Problem-based learning and also discusses a few challenges in incorporating this approach in the existing undergraduate medical curriculum. The article proposes the use of social media in order to support learner autonomy, which in turn improves learners’ cognitive engagement with content and tasks, thereby assisting the development of attributes associated with capability."

This tutorial introduces the overall systemsarchitecture and patterns for data streams that enable autonomyfor marine robots in environmental sensing applications. The articleproposes the concept of cyber-maritime cycle and surveys its use as arecent development in marine robotics. Supported by communicationnetworks, autonomy can be achieved using at least three feedback loopsin a cyber-maritime cycle, each running at different time scales or temporalfrequencies. When information is circulating around the cycle, itis transformed between two representations: the Lagrangian view andthe Eulerian view. Important functional blocks, such as mission planning,path planning, data assimilation, and data-driven modeling arediscussed as providing conversions between the two views of data. Thetutorial starts with an overview of enabling technologies in sensing,navigation, and communication for marine robotics. The design of experimentmethod is then reviewed to plan optimal sensing locations forthe robots. The tutorial discusses a class of path planning methods thatproduces desired trajectories of marine robots while combating oceancurrent. The lack of an accurate Eulerian map for ocean current willlead to tracking error when robots attempt to follow the planned pathsto collect Lagrangian data. The performance of robot navigation can beevaluated through the controlled Lagrangian particle tracking method,which computes trends and bounds for the growth of the tracking error.To improve the accuracy of the Eulerian map of ocean current, adata-driven modeling approach is adopted. Data assimilation methodsare leveraged to convert Lagrangian data into Eulerian map. In addition,the spatial and temporal resolution of Eulerian data maps canbe further improved by the motion tomography method. This tutorialgives a comprehensive view of data streams and major functional blocksunderlying autonomy of marine robots."

This research explores how Reddit’s users, moderators, and administrators surface values (like free speech, privacy, dignity, and autonomy), hint at ethical principles (what content, speech, behavior ought to be restricted and under what conditions), through a continuous process of (re)negotiating expectations and norms around values, ethics, and power on the site. Central to this research are questions such as: Who or what influences and/or determines social practice on Reddit? Who participates in decision-making and using what processes and mechanisms? Where do controversies arise and how are they resolved? Generating findings from a particular controversy surrounding the subreddit /r/jailbait, the author illustrates the complexities inherent in these questions and suggests that a participatory policymaking approach might contribute to future research and practice in this area."

The aim of this research is to define the strategies followed by journalists to create or boost their personal brand on Twitter. The methodology is based on in-depth interviews with 15 Spanish journalists from different professional profiles and roles. The findings allow to identify and conceptualise the four basic strategies used to meld the image they project to their social audience. These strategies are positioning, content curation, personalization and specialisation. This study also allows to set the main skills and resources associated with each strategy.

Several studies have investigated the effect of Facebook dependency on individuals’ psychological well-being. However, inadequate studies have examined the impacts of Facebook in eudaimonic well-being. The current study explores how emotional dependence on Facebook relates to psychological well-being in eudaimonic approach. A total of 401, 13 to 16 yearsold who studied at an upper secondary school in Malaysia participated in this study. We expected a negative association between emotional dependence on Facebook and psychological wellbeing. The moderation effect of self-efficacy was examined in the current research. The results of structural equation modeling revealed that emotional dependence on Facebook negatively effects adolescents’ overall psychological well-being. The influence was more pronounced on autonomy, purpose in life, and positive relationship with others. The results also demonstrated that high self-efficacy did not reduce negative impacts of Facebook emotional dependence on adolescents’ psychological well-being."

Teachers can help students who are gifted to be motivated by using technology to help provide autonomy and authenticity in the curriculum. Technology can be used as a tool for student autonomy when it is used in ways that give the student choices. Teacher can use the Internet to provide students access to different topics. When students can control the depth and breadth of content through what they learn using technology, they are motivated. Technology also allows individual students control over the pacing of learning when they can accelerate through easily mastered or already mastered material, and then slow down when something particularly interesting is encountered. Authenticity, where students are doing work or experiencing learning activities that are equivalent to adult or expert experiences, are accessible to students through technology, but only if teachers plan for it. Particularly web 2.0 technologies allow students to create authentic products for authentic audiences because the can publish and share a variety of media. Technology can facilitate student collaboration and allow for mentoring from experts. Gifted students, who can be motivated by competition, can also increase the competitions available to them by looking for competitions online. Teachers control student access to and uses for technology within the school setting. If teachers are concerned about students who are gifted developing to their full potential, then planning for motivation makes sense and technology is a ready tool."

Many of the growing numbers of independent professionals are attracted by these ways of working. Developments in Information and Communication Technology have been critical, especially in enabling services, including professional services, to be delivered via internet platforms. This has created, in effect, new forms of intermediation and increasingly complex work relationships. These developments have often proved very controversial, as instanced by the disputes surrounding Uber, the international, internet-based taxi provider. Many of these changes also raise issues of accountability and work quality, along with creating new patterns of work relationships. Inevitably, the changes also highlight the role of regulation, which is the main focus of this article The topic is explored against a backdrop of much recent deregulation, challenges to so-called ‘red tape’ and laissez faire policies. The myriad of disputes and litigation involving Uber is examined and reflected upon. There are, of course, many differences between the taxi drivers of Uber and the designers, journalists, engineers and consultants, typical of independent professional working, but there are also some key parallels and experiences that provide a cautionary tale!"

Sudbury, MA: Jones and Bartlett Publishers, 2000. i65 pp. ISBN 0-7637-i269-8.Deregulation and the Internet’s expansion have brought with them decentralized control in communications and publishing. Individuals have gained extraordinary power in exercising free speech and, if they so choose, encrypting that speech to protect it. As this virtual space becomes a greater part of our lives, society is faced with readdressing the social issues of free speech, privacy, intellectual property, and security issues in the context of cyberspace.Cyberethics does not profess to have the answers. It presents issues as a starting point for discussion. There is a need to go beyond law, norms, market place, and software code to find answers for regulating behavior in this new medium called cyberspace. We must also consider the fundamental principles of ethics, principles with a universal quality that transcend space and time. We must be cautious in our decisions to ensure that we do not sacrifice justice and human rights for the sake of the majority. Regulating through external forces can be e∂ective to some degree, but there is greater value in having fixed ethical values as the constraining force, values that promote an atmosphere where individuals can pursue their own well-being, a place where they can flourish. With this premise in mind (the need for an ethical groundwork when addressing the social issues surrounding the Internet), Spinello’s work explores how the basic values of autonomy and privacy should be the core for those who would regulate cyberspace to ensure that decisions made will be fair and just.Utilitarian rights promulgated by Mill and Bentham; the contractual rights of Locke, Rousseau, and Rawls; the natural rights of Aquinas and Finnis; the pluralism of Kant: each philosophy contributes possibilities for approaches to an ethical backbone for cyberspace. From utilitarianism comes cost benefit analysis with its inherent flaw of possibly subverting human rights if it benefits a majority. Spinello uses the monitoring of corporate email as an example of weighing the benefit versus the cost for such behavior. In the contractual discussion, i.e., the implicit social contract between an individual and society, property and privacy rights are used to illustrate that although the premise is appealing, utilitarianism gives no guidelines for choosing one right over another when each is valued. Spamming is used to illustrate the complexity of this need to have guidelines for selection when one value interferes with another. Marketers consider mass e-mailings as a right under free speech, while the recipients take issue with invasion of privacy and misuse of valuable resources (employee time and computer storage). Natural rights look at the individual’s right to flourish, the right to truth in communication, the right not to be falsely accused, etc. Policies for cybercommunication should support this right to flourish. Introducing Kant’s concept of a universal principle into the discussion of online provision o∂ers a basis for fair service. Proposed services should be examined in light of whether expanding the service will be acceptable as a universal principle and not just expedient for the individual creating it. Are all treated with the respect that one would expect for oneself if the service is initiated? The flaw in this comes with its lack of flexibility for competing values. Using these guiding principles for cyberspace, we must first judge whether any policy imposed is partial, and second, whether it is fair and just, not for a majority, but for all.Spinello challenges the reader to give thought to best solutions for very di[double dagger]cult questions. …"

But how is this possible, when the attributes of mobile phones (mobility, connectivity, sociability) contradict the socialisation of women, particularly in Africa, where a ‘desirable’ femininity entails withdrawal from public spaces, shyness and being mostly confined to domestic settings? Using domestication theory, this study explores these questions through in-depth interviews with young female and male students in three higher learning institutions in Harare. While the mobile phone and Internet amplify the importance of identity construction and the psychological need by young women to formulate an empowering sense of self, there is a dialectical tension between the need for women’s autonomy from disempowering social processes vis-a-vis conformity to social hierarchy. Overall, these technologies – among other more formal processes such as education and legislati…"

Using a qualitative methodology, based on four focus groups, we analyze the motivations and problems they find when using such procedures. The results indicate acceptance of electronic resources for simple and routine tasks due to the speed and convenience they offer, which simultaneously promotes the independence and empowerment of older people. However, there is a series of factors which have a negative effect on their use, and these must be dealt with in order to favor greater digital inclusion of this age demographic."

The addition of much more computing power and object-bound data storage will lead to new possibilities for the advancement of autonomy in production systems. Autonomous message exchange and coordination can help to prevent quality problems (for instance wrong pairing of tool and work piece) and improve the disturbance management (for instance by faster information about current and probable disturbances). Due to the fact that nearly all improvements of existing production systems with cyber-physical systems take place in real and active manufacturing sites, on-site experiments to find out the right degree of autonomy for production objects are not suitable. Therefore a lab approach is necessary. In this contribution a hybrid lab approach to simulate various degrees of autonomy is presented [1] . The paper starts with a definition of autonomy and suggests measurement methods [2] . After a short introduction into the lab concept the results of some test runs are presented where autonomous objects perform the same production program as dumb production objects. Finally, an outlook for further research is given."

An automation conundrum exists in which as more autonomy is added to a system, and its reliability and robustness increase, the lower the situation awareness of human operators and the less likely that they will be able to take over manual control when needed. The human-autonomy systems oversight model integrates several decades of relevant autonomy research on operator situation awareness, out-of-the-loop performance problems, monitoring, and trust, which are all major challenges underlying the automation conundrum. Key design interventions for improving human performance in interacting with autonomous systems are integrated in the model, including human-automation interface features and central automation interaction paradigms comprising levels of automation, adaptive automation, and granularity of control approaches. Recommendations for the design of human-autonomy interfaces are presented and directions for future research discussed."

This concept is extended to a conflict of autonomy between components of a human-machine system, such as Cyber-Physical & Human Systems (CPHS). The autonomy of the CPHS is modeled by a triplet representing three sets of knowledge: the Competence, the Availability and the Prescription. The so-called Competence-Availability-Prescription (CAP) model is then proposed to represent the capability of the CPHS to act alone and to control possible emergent behaviours such as conflicts of autonomy in terms of competence, availability and/or prescription. The formalism of the Petri nets is used to model the three CAP model parameters and to control possible conflicts between them. A feasibility study of the application of such CAP model and Petri nets is presented for the car driving domain involving the car driver interacting with Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) such as an Automated Speed Control System (ASCS)."

However, few have had advance care planning discussions or completed documentation to ensure future care preferences are acted upon. This study examines the awareness, attitudes, and experiences of advance care planning amongst older people and unrelated offspring/caregivers of older people residing in the community.Qualitative descriptive research, which included focus groups with older people (55+ years) and older people’s offspring/caregivers living in an Australian city and surrounding rural region. Data was analysed using an inductive and comparative approach. Sampling was both convenience and purposive. Participants responded to web-based, newsletter or email invitations from an agency, which aims to support healthcare consumers, a dementia support group, or community health centres in areas with high proportions of culturally and linguistically diverse community-dwellers.Eight focus groups were attended by a homogenous sample of 15 older people and 27 offspring/caregivers, with 43% born overseas. The overarching theme, ‘shades of grey’: struggles in transition, reflects challenges faced by older people and their offspring/caregivers as older people often erratically transition from independence and capacity to dependence and/or incapacity. Offspring/caregivers regularly struggled with older people’s fluctuating autonomy and dependency as older people endeavoured to remain at home, and with conceptualising “best times” to actualise advance care planning with substitute decision maker involvement. Advance care planning was supported and welcomed, x advance care planning literacy was evident. Difficulties planning for hypothetical health events and socio-cultural attitudes thwarting death-related discussions were emphasised. Occasional offspring/caregivers with previous substitute decision maker experience reported distress related to their decisions.Advance care planning programs traditionally assume participants are ‘planning ready’ to legally appoint a substitute decision maker (power of attorney) and record end-of-life treatment preferences in short time frames. This contrasts with how community dwelling older people and offspring/caregivers conceive future care decisions over time. Advance care planning programs need to include provision of information, which supports older people’s advance care planning understanding and management, and also supports offspring/caregivers’ development of strategies for broaching advance care planning with older people, and preparing for potential substitute decision maker roles. Development and integration of strategies to support older people’s decision-making when in the ‘grey zone’, with fluctuating cognitive capacities, needs further consideration. Findings support an advance care planning model with conversations occurring at key points across a person’s lifespan."

A practice in libertarian prefigurative politics, Bitcoin demonstrates the capacity for online subgroups to creatively appropriate internet-based technologies to enact alternative futures. Andrew Feenberg’s critical theory of technology clarifies this capacity and outlines the significance of agency in technical action. As technology mediates many social relations, it has a significant role in the reproduction of social power. Technological agency is therefore a crucial site of resistance in which users can form alternative, democratic rationalizations of technology. Yet are such instances of agency intrinsically democratic? In analysing this aspect of Feenberg’s theory, this article argues that Bitcoin represents a ‘popular rationalization’ of technology – a creative appropriation of technology that empowers some groups while lacking the ethical justification necessary to be considered democratic."

Desselle \nDetermine students’ self-reported use of Twitter in a health systems course and gauge their perceptions of its value and utility for self-guided supplementation of course material, and evaluate the quality of students’ reflections from information they found on Twitter.Students in a health systems course create a Twitter account to remain abreast of current developments in pharmacy and health systems. They were afforded the autonomy to follow organizations/individuals they chose and write reflective mini-papers on selected tweets from their Twitter feed prior to each course session. A self-administered survey solicited students’ favor toward various aspects of the Twitter reflection assignment. An examination of students’ reflections as the course progressed was also undertaken.Approximately 2/3 of the students enrolled in the course responded to the survey. Student perceptions of the Twitter assignment were quite favorable, with highest favor related to facets regarding the construction of their own learning and continuation of engagement throughout the course. Responses to open-ended questions corroborated students’ perceptions of their own learning, as did the content and quality of their reflections during progression of the course.The course design reinforced previous claims outside of pharmacy that Twitter can be a useful tool to reinforce or create new learning paradigms, but especially under the auspices of established theory, such as a constructivist environment employing constructionism pedagogy. A course like health systems in programs of academic pharmacy might especially benefit from use of Twitter and such course design."

The extension project “Training for Science/Chemistry teachers: round of conversation involving teachers’ knowledge and practices” aims to establish the so called “Triads of Professional (interaction) Training”. This process aims to problematize the knowledge by experience and to allow reflection, an important aspect for the constitution of a teacher’s autonomy and protagonism. Data was analyzed based on a Discourse Textual Analysis. Results indicate that teachers have a being knowledge and a doing knowledge that originate from practice, but that need to be revealed and problematized so that it can produce progress and qualify the teaching action. The interaction process involving the triad is potentially significant for the continuous training."

Since the aspiration of the majority of older people is to live safely and well at home, housing monitoring will be part of health & care integration in the next decades. As a consequence, a higher proportion of people will have to rely on family, friends or neighbours as their informal caregivers, providing that this group already count as around 80% of all caregivers in the EU). The varied and cumulative problems that this caregivers face include loss of personal opportunities and self-esteem, financial problems or physical and emotional problems. Several strategies need to be enforced to prevent the burnout and improve the quality of life of these informal caregivers, such as the possibility of providing them with useful and reliable monitoring tools that can help reduce the exhausting and continuous supervision activity they have to perform, reduce their stress, and increase their leisure time while improving the autonomy and wellness of the dependent people. The technological solutions currently in use are invasive (wearable sensors) or require actions difficult to perform by the elder (call or press the button), in critical situations (e.g. falling or fainting situations, where the elder is not able to give any response). As an alternative to these solutions, this paper describes Care Respite, a novel non-invasive, real-time and privacy-preserving monitoring technology conceived for the first time as a real respite for those taking care of others and describes the results of the case studies. Short description : The Care Respite technology is composed of an ambient intelligent device (AID) and a remote receiver. The AID device includes a Microsoft Kinect multi-modal sensor and a computer unit. The sensor captures audio and depth maps from around 25 m2 (thanks to its infrared structured light technology) to be processed in a computer unit by an advanced generation of Computer Vision software. This software is able to recognize specific events like: leaving the environment, falling/fainting, high agitation, etc. Monitoring can be done in dark environments thanks to the infrared technology of the sensor, therefore the appearance of the person is not used at all. The alert is transmitted to a receiver, any smartphone with Internet connection. With our smartphone application, different caregivers can share the monitoring task of a single person, and a single caregiver can monitor multiple dependent people at the same time. Key findings : The innovative aspect of Care Respite relies on (i) the benefits of the incorporation and exploitation of novel computer vision technologies now available thanks to the use of low-cost depth cameras, and (ii) on the feedback provided by informal and professional caregivers during these last two years. No other monitoring system in the market addressed to the caregivers is comparable in terms of safety, relief, autonomy, satisfaction, intimacy and cost reduction. The system does not require a fixed installation point, therefore the monitoring camera can be placed anywhere inside a home or a retirement house. Highlights : Low cost RGB-D cameras are completely changing the computer vision world, as they are being successfully used in several applications and research areas. Following this trend, the first users of Care Respite liked the idea of exploiting depth data (not the appearance) recorded at the older person’s homes to send alarms and information to their caregivers, who are connected using smartphone. An additional feature that liked the first users of Care Respite is its personalization aspect: the remote smartphone application allows the professionals or family carers to choose which risky events to monitor. Another lesson learnt during implementation is that the remote visualization and communication via image and audio is an essential and supporting tool for fast responses in case of risk, while improving the autonomy and life quality of both the elderly and their caregivers. Conclusion : This project aims at ensuring that all disabled or chronically ill people can get the help they need without overburdening their families. Improving carers’ quality of life and preventing their burnout require new solutions that are affordable and user friendly for families and caregivers. In this context, Care Respite represents a technological solution for the automatic detection of events like falling down, not moving during a period of time, receiving an unexpected visit or being absent from a room. The intelligent software is able to send an alert to the mobile device of the caregivers allowing real time response."

It is precisely one of these models – a pedagogical model to deconstruct moving pictures-, that we intend to analyze, describing its impact on the academic self-concept of twenty-four graduate students, based on the qualitative analysis of their own perceptions and narratives. The results show that these pedagogical model environments – whose design is anchored in the principles of socio-constructivism, collaborative learning, autonomy, flexibility and interaction – may have very positive effects on the academic self-concept of higher education students in the various dimensions taken into consideration: Motivation, task Orientation, Confidence in their own capacities and Relationship with colleagues. The implications of the results are discussed not only from a practical intervention point of view, but also in terms of future research."

One of the objectives of the system is to help the students involved progress towards autonomy – defined as “the ability to take charge of one’s own learning” (Holec 1981: 3) or “as the capacity to take control over one’s own learning” (Benson 2001: 2) – in their learning of English. The implementation of the system involves a new conception of the different actors’ roles. Teachers become tutors, or counsellors, as defined by CRAPEL (Gremmo, 1995; Ciekanski, 2005) with new specific pedagogical goals (Bertin, Grave & Narcy-Combes, 2010) and the learners have a new role to play. The introduction of two new guidance tools over the last years – a logbook, and specific sections in the existing forum of the VLE – were meant to help the students develop a reflexive approach and thus enhance autonomization, or developing learners’ capacity to learn (Holec 1990: 77), and, in a second time, to promote the development of collaborative learning strategies and encourage the students to use strategies which they would not primarily have thought of. The guidance tools used in this specific language learning environment such as the counselling appointments, the logbook, and the forum, may influence the roles played by the different actors, but also the representations they have of their own roles, which may have an impact on their motivation and thus on the autonomization process (Dickinson, 1995). From the creation of the flexible system five years ago, the research has studied a population of 610 students through quantitative and qualitative analyses (Chateau, 2008; Chateau & Zumbihl, 2010). Focusing on the results obtained with the last population of students, the paper discusses the differences between them and the previous populations, and in particular whether the evolution of the roles played by the different actors, as compared with traditional language teaching/learning situations, has been enhanced."

Papic \nRapid development of information technology makes life easier; however, negative aspects of its influence can be recognized as well. Using Internet provides series of opportunities for better communication, higher quality education and great fun but involves a lot of risk. Young people spend majority of their time using digital technologies, therefore becoming key actors in creating good or bad peer communication. The young/adolescents are also exposed to the highest level of risk on the net because they have high level of autonomy and independence, because Internet erases social brakes, gives them fake feeling of safety and power, allows users say and do things they couldn’t do in face-to-face communication. The young have the feeling they aren’t responsible for that kind of behavior in a way they would normally be responsible, they are sure that on the net they won’t be judged by their looks; relations on the net seem safer than real relations, there are nosocial boundaries; two lonely souls can communicate without being watched. Among the most mentioned risks are various forms of digital violence, from disturbing to most severe forms of violence, exposure to inappropriate content, exposure to political, economic and religious propaganda, disinformation, privacy threat, soliciting gambling and illegal activities. One way of protection on the net in order to prevent unwanted communication is to educate students, parents and teachers about the risks of digital technology and digital literacy.Parents consider that they are sufficiently informed about what their children do online, but think they need more information and education. The role of schools in preventing digital violence is very important because it is the place where children in an organized way spend most time during th e day. The educational mission of school is to promote social relationships with students, colleagues and parents, and educational task is to teach about the use of modern media and technology, with special emphasis on digital literacy. Therefore, the school and its employees have an extremely important role in the prevention of abuse of digital technology."

Delivery of Kidscreen-52 test by email to 3,738 students, of which 1,277 replied (34.16%). The Winsteps program model and Rasch punctuation were used. Results: The dimensions Physical Well-being, State of Mood and Emotions, and Autonomy scored less than 42 Rasch points, and the other two dimensions – Psychological Well-being and Friends and Social Support - had significantly lower scores than those found in Chilean adolescents of a comparable age, in women, in students of lower socio-economical levels in municipal public schools with a Scholar Vulnerability Index, or those with a disability, health problem, or chronic illness. The differences are greater in Faculties with heavier academic demands. Discussion: This first study gives new information in an area seldom studied, which is important for students, academics, and authorities. It is suspected that similar results would be found in other university settings. Conclusions: HRQoL studies are feasible to apply in institutions of higher education, to benefit both students and educators. This study contributes to the diagnosis and evaluation of public policies on student support, and for teaching strategies. In the near future, HRQoL instruments could be applied with other students and other members of the university community, in combination with studies on risk factors."

In the absence of satisfactory explanations in relation to previously determined objectives and direction towards other sites, the students are not only misdirected but also exposed to trouble some self-measurement processes.

International, regional and national bodies have enacted a number of binding and non-binding document for physicians and researchers to adhere to, in order to protect the autonomy, dignity and privacy of patients and research subjects. With the development of new technologies, the right to privacy has gained a new perspective; the right to protection of personal data within information and communication technologies. The right to data protection has been attributed an increasing importance within EU law. Accordingly, the use of health data in medical research in general and in biobank-related medical research in particular, has made data protection law highly relevant. In medical research involving biobanks, transferring human biological samples and/or individual health data is taking place on a daily basis. These transfers involve several oversight bodies, institutional review boards (IRBs), research ethics committees, or even data protection authorities. This article investigates the role of these national oversight bodies in the transfer of health data in cross-border research, from an EU law point of view. A special focus is laid on transfer of health data for research purposes from the EU to the US, in the light of the recently enacted EU-US Privacy Shield. The main question posed is how American oversight bodies for medical research can be expected to handle the increasingly strict EU requirements for the processing of health data in medical research review."

Multiple resources can be placed on a site easily accessible 24/7 and computer mediated communication in various forms can supply needed human interaction spaces. But how are these sites used by the local students? Following the path of several individuals in detail can allow more understanding and depth of the precise usage of space. This paper tracks two Arab students exploring and using a newly formed online self-access centre (SAC) for writing or online writing lab (OWL) for the best part of a semester. As an exploratory action research study, it was data driven and multiple data sources were mainly unobtrusive so that the study could proceed very naturally. The choices, learning style, autonomy types and personality differences between the two students suggest a range of support is ideal in an online SAC to cater for individuals in this context, including resources, how to learn, 1-1 asynchronous with advisor (emails), forums, electronic writing raters, and a high profile test. Ongoing action research should help to keep the online facility relevant to needs and open to new ways."

Sturtz \nDavid Barry Gaspar and Darlene Clark Hine, eds., Beyond Bondage: Free Women of Color in the Americas, Champaign, Illinois: University of Illinois Press, 2004, xi + 329 pp.Building on the success of More Than Chattel: Black Women and Slavery in the Americas (1996), their edited volume of essays on and enslaved black women, David Barry Gaspar and Darlene Clark Hine have collected another impressive set of essays analysing the lives of women in slave-based societies from across the Americas in their new, and in many ways complementary, volume. This remarkably balanced set of articles discusses women’s lives in a wide range of geographic settings, from Antigua west to New Orleans and from Kentucky south to Brazil; in rural and urban settings; and under a variety of imperial regimes, including Spanish, French, British and US. Comparisons among the conditions of women of colour are further enhanced by the chronological span of this book, beginning in the seventeenth century and continuing to the middle of the nineteenth.The breadth of coverage permits the reader to consider the lives and experiences of women of colour and, even more, to reconsider the very concepts of freedom and bondage. After all, how was a free woman of colour when social practices and legal restrictions still limited her self-determination? The editors conclude that women of colour could never completely escape slavery’s hold on their lives because colour prejudice, enforced by local precepts, curtailed their autonomy, even if these restrictions occurred in different forms in the various settings represented in these essays.The editors divide the essays into two sections. The first chapters, listed under the heading Achieving and Preserving Freedom, describe the ways in which women obtained status, whether through marronage, self-purchase, lifetime or deathbed grant. In Martinique and Guadeloupe sheer laziness on the part of enslavers who demanded little or no work from their former bonds people, but also failed to complete the official procedures that would have allowed these women to enjoy documented manumission, left them in an in-between, quasifree, state as libres de fait. Documentation in other settings, such as the US South, left officially free women of colour in quasi freedom. As late as 1861, US women of colour occasionally sought to re-enslave themselves because of the limited opportunities that they were offered to support themselves and their children, or they would be forced to leave their still-enslaved family members under state laws that exiled persons of colour manumitted after specified dates. …"

IA usually emerges during the transition to self-feeding, when the child issues of autonomy are played out daily in the feeding situation. Studies evidence that the feeding interactions between children with IA and their mothers are characterized by low reciprocity, greater interactional conflict and negative affects (Chatoor et al., 2000; Ammaniti et al., 2010, 2012). Moreover, these studies pointed out that maternal depression and eating disorders are frequently associated with IA (Cooper et al., 2004; Ammaniti et al., 2010; Lucarelli et al., 2013). To date, research has focused almost exclusively on the mother-child dyad, while fathers’ involvement, co-parental and family interactions are poorly studied. The current study is a pilot research that investigated mother-father-child triadic interactions, during feeding and play, in families with children diagnosed with IA, in comparison to families with normally developing children. Until now, at the study participated N = 10 families (five with a child with IA diagnosis and five with lack of child’s IA diagnosis, matched for child’s age and gender). The parents-child triadic interactions were assessed in feeding and play contexts using the Lausanne Trilogue Play (Fivaz-Depeursinge and Corboz-Warnery, 1999), adapted to observe father-mother-infant primary triangle in the feeding context, compared to the play context (Lucarelli et al., 2012). Families of the IA-group showed difficulties in expressing and sharing pleasure and positive affects, and in structuring a predictable and flexible context. Children showed little autonomy and difficulty in being actively engaged and tune with parents. Dysfunctional family interactions are a critical issue for IA that affects co-parental and family subsystems, stressing the importance of an articulated diagnostic assessment in order to target effective treatment approaches."

These conditions are that the learner must at least be prepared to accept the degree of autonomy given to them.

This paper throws light on Traditional and Internet learning and affirms that understudy execution as measured by assessment is self-governing. 21st century guideline structure is advancing the internet usage to accomplish consideration of extra time-and place-bound students.

How many online understudies are compelling when stood out from their classroom accomplices is essential for demonstrating workforce and others blamed for evaluation. Eagerness in an online circumstance may be more trying in examination system classes than in other open association classes. In addition, backing may be less frightening, and the quality and measure of affiliation may be extended in online classes. The remote correspondence permits learner to get the taking in materials and addresses from any place the length of they are associated with the web.

Buitelaar \nPost-mortem privacy is becoming a vital topic of public and scholarly legal concern. Post-mortem privacy is understood as the right of a person to preserve and control what becomes of his reputation and dignity after death. The assumption that the deceased does not qualify for privacy rights, because his bodily presence has been terminated, no longer holds in our networked society. In the digital age, the phenomenon of the digital legacy that an Internet user leaves behind after his demise, has led to new challenges for the legal system. The deceased is no longer in a position to exercise human autonomy as an active agent. The article reconsiders the notion of human autonomy with regard to these digital representations. Taking the point of view that the control over personal information (also known as informational self-determination) is essential in protecting one’s privacy in the antemortem life, the article explores whether this principle may have validity in the postmortem context. Legal philosophical arguments are advanced in a discourse about the quandary if digital personae of deceased persons can be bestowed with a legal basis of personality rights and concomitantly privacy rights. Therefore much attention is given to the problem of the subject, which does not seem to be functioning in the case of the absence of a living subject. Briefly referring to novel personae, it is argued that fundamental human rights need not be limited to the rights of living human beings."

The changing economic conditions not only increased the participation of women and men in labor force but also in entrepreneurial activity. The supporting activities of the national economies, providing incentives, increased need to change and diversity, developing technology, the easy access to information through the internet and social and individual factors increased the willingness of individuals to become an entrepreneur. In macro level, engaging in entrepreneurial activities contribute to the countries’ economies by providing employment opportunities for others, creating new businesses, generating new wealth and adding to national income and creating social change with innovative actions. In individual level, it also provides benefits such as individual autonomy, control and particularly financial freedom and freedom on adjusting work schedule. All these positive features are the one side of the coin, challenging work conditions, taken risks that are based on the motive of making profit and critical decisions in order to ensure the sustainability of business present the other side of coin. All these difficulties which are related with work life create a physical and psychological response that is called job stress. Today’s work life consists of rapidly changing technology, globalization and many economic crises that causes the individuals to perceive higher level of job stress than before. The relation between job stress and employee well-being and health has been the subject of many studies. Nurses, doctors, emergency workers, firefighters and policemen have formed the sample of the many studies on job stress due to stressful working conditions and job quality (Cevik, 2011; Goceri, 2014). The results revealed that job stress affects employees’ physical and mental health directly and negatively, and is positively related to their job dissatisfaction, burnout, absenteeism, loss of production and performance, and high turnover rates (Bolino & Turnley, 2005; Flanagan, 2006; Kazmi, Amjad & Khan, 2008; Rothmann, Jackson & Krueger, 2003). Social support is the other important variable associated with the job stress. La Rocco, House & French (1980), in their study on 636 male employees revealed that employees perceived social support from their colleagues and managers affect negatively their job stress. Blau (1981), reported that social support reduces the level of job stress and negative judgments of business through which individuals may have. Daniels and Guppy (1994), indicated that, in the light of data obtained from 244 accountants, social support decreases the job stress of accountants and have a positive impact on well-being of individuals. Despite the individual, social and economical advantages of entrepreneurship, it also considered as stressful and difficult work activities due to nature of business environment. Therefore, identification of the possible effect of social support on job stress of entrepreneurs provides necessary information about correctional entrepreneurs’ work environment and rendering support. The absence of empirical research about the association of social support and job stress, especially on entrepreneurs creates the incentives to do the present study. This study aims at assessing the effect of perceived social support on job stress for entrepreneurs in Australia. The examination of reducing factor of stress such as support would help to deal with stress’ costly negative outcomes that affect individuals and organizations alike. In addition, it intends to find out whether there is any difference between women and men entrepreneurs on perception of this effect or not by multi-group structural equation modeling. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK AND HYPOTHESIS Conservation of resource theory, which is a stress theory developed by Stevan Hobfoll (1989), examine the demands in the environment and the individuals’ resources to deal with these demands in order to identify stress process. …"

I argue that the relational emphasis of field theory, modified by the concept of media meta-capital, can be a fruitful way of examining the social context in which representations of Muslims are produced. This advances scholarship that relies too heavily on content analysis to support judgements about news representations of Muslims. I use examples from original fieldwork in Glasgow to discuss the capital, autonomy and heteronomy of Muslim sources who are ‘authorised knowers’ and ‘new entrants’ in their source communities. These various positions are evident in their relative success in managing journalist–source relations, which encompass ‘legacy’ media platforms and emerging communication tools such as Twitter. The field theory perspective exposes relations that contribute to the work of representation but are invisible to other forms of analysis."

Nowadays, the availability of non-stigmatising sensors such as inertial sensors embedded on Smartphones allows the estimation of people’s postures in real time in order to evaluate their autonomy in daily life. Our aim is to propose an unconstrained and non-intrusive method based on inertial sensors, which gives an indicator about a person’s autonomy. This method determines the correlation between people’s postures and activities over time in order to compute an index of ADL ( IndexADL ), specific to each person. The IndexADL variation over time is then a useful feature for positively or negatively evaluating people’s autonomy.  Our experiment, based on data collection of eight elderly people over a 3-month period, analyses the Lunch and Dinner activities with promising performances."

To this end, has been analyzed the MOOC Information and Communication Technologies in Education in the Coursera platform. The working methodology was based on the review of the main concepts (communication and collaboration) discussed in relation to the AVA, the main topics of discussion forums, management students in learning communities, participation in various communication channels, results of course approval. These results demonstrated that communication and collaboration is possible in MOOCs, and how autonomy and motivation is substantial for collaborative efforts among hundreds of participants. The study confirmed that collaborative products can be made voluntarily, if participants have a common language and similar incentives."

Internet questionnaire surveys and data collection were conducted to test proposed hypotheses by means of structural equation modeling with AMOS.\nFindings\nReciprocity, learning, and altruism have significant positive influence on persistent sharing willingness, and the degree to which each factor influences persistent sharing willingness differs considerably. Autonomy support, perceived usefulness, and relatedness support have no significantly direct influence on persistent sharing willingness, but they indirectly influence the persistent sharing behaviors by the mediating effect of different autonomous motivations.\nOriginality/value\nThis study contributes theoretically and practically. First, the results suggest that a particular motivation in different contexts has a different degree of autonomy. In addition, explanations are offered for the phenomenon that suggest that controlled motivations directly affect autonomous motivations. It was found that the contextual factors of competence support and relatedness support also have influence on different autonomous motivations, and hence encourage knowledge-sharing behaviors. Specific suggestions for QQ group managers and information seekers are proposed."

Transactions in ECOS may, therefore, be conducted in an unreliable environment and be vulnerable to frauds. Trust management schemes, naturally, have come as feasible solutions. With a view to making improvement on the existing trust management mechanisms, we, in this paper, propose a factor-enrichment-based hybrid trust framework for trust measurement in ECOS, in which three levels of trust are used to establish trustworthy opinions among individuals for their transactions: 1) private reputation, which is defined as subjective trustworthy impression among individuals with respect to its feature of dynamic evolution; 2) common reputation, which is defined as collective and sharable trust degree and is proposed with two factors, a consistency factor and a continuity factor, introduced for enhancing the reliability of common reputation; and 3) the hybrid trust, which is proposed to obtain integrated trustable impressions based on private reputation and common reputation, with anti-fraud factor and confidence factor presented to further determine the trustworthiness of hybrid trust. Finally, we list the results of a series of examinations to further verify the performance of our mechanism."

Hains \n Michael Parr \n David Milliss \n Robert Herkes \n Johanna I. Westbrook \nPublic policy in many health systems is currently dominated by the quest to find ways to ‘do more with less’-to achieve better outcomes at a reduced cost. The success or failure of initiatives in support of this quest are often understood in terms of an adversarial dynamic or struggle between the professional logics of medicine and of management. Here, we use the case of the introduction of information and communication technology (ICT) to a well-established ritual of medical autonomy (the medical ward round) to articulate a more nuanced explanation of how and why new ways of working with technology are accepted and adopted (or not).The study was conducted across four intensive care units (ICUs) in major teaching hospitals in Sydney, Australia. Using interviews, we examined 48 doctors’ perceptions of the impact of ICT on ward round practice. We applied the concept of institutional logics to frame our analysis. Interview transcripts were analysed using a hybrid of deductive and inductive thematic analysis.The doctors displayed a complex engagement with the technology that belies simplistic characterisations of medical rejection of managerial encroachment. In fact, they selectively welcomed into the ward round aspects of the technology which reinforced the doctor’s place in the healthcare hierarchy and which augmented their role as scientists. At the same time, they guarded against allowing managerial logic embedded in ICT to de-emphasise their embodied subjectivity in relation to the patient as a person rather than as a collection of parameters.ICT can force the disruption of some aspects of existing routines, even where these are long-established rituals. Resistance arose when the new technology did not fit with the ‘logic of care’. Incorporation of the logic of care into the design and customisation of clinical information systems is a challenge and potentially counterproductive, because it could attempt to apply a technological fix to what is essentially a social problem. However, there are significant opportunities to ensure that new technologies do not obstruct doctors’ roles as carers nor disrupt the embodied relationship they need to have with patients."

Crandall \nDo claims of “free speech” provide cover for prejudice? We investigate whether this defense of racist or hate speech serves as a justification for prejudice. In a series of 8 studies (N = 1,624), we found that explicit racial prejudice is a reliable predictor of the “free speech defense” of racist expression. Participants endorsed free speech values for singing racists songs or posting racist comments on social media; people high in prejudice endorsed free speech more than people low in prejudice (meta-analytic r = .43). This endorsement was not principled-high levels of prejudice did not predict endorsement of free speech values when identical speech was directed at coworkers or the police. Participants low in explicit racial prejudice actively avoided endorsing free speech values in racialized conditions compared to nonracial conditions, but participants high in racial prejudice increased their endorsement of free speech values in racialized conditions. Three experiments failed to find evidence that defense of racist speech by the highly prejudiced was based in self-relevant or self-protective motives. Two experiments found evidence that the free speech argument protected participants’ own freedom to express their attitudes; the defense of other’s racist speech seems motivated more by threats to autonomy than threats to self-regard. These studies serve as an elaboration of the Justification-Suppression Model (Crandall & Eshleman, 2003) of prejudice expression. The justification of racist speech by endorsing fundamental political values can serve to buffer racial and hate speech from normative disapproval. (PsycINFO Database Record"

This model is used to question the relevance of the learner autonomy model, which has been a cornerstone of language learning policy in Europe for the past 30 years. A research project is discussed, with particular attention to the relevant research methodologies in this field, investigating how non-specialist language learners use the Internet in their spare time to read and listen to English, and also communicate in English, notably in online communities through social networking websites."

    "text": "Doc 814 :  Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL) Applications for Interactive and Engaging Classrooms: APPsolutely! \nhttps://zenodo.org/record/2665016\n Ajda Osifo \n Amanda Radwan \nMobile Assisted Language Learning, a specialization of mobile learning, represents a new field of the educational system, which offers new possibilities of delivering content to learners and facilitates the learning process. Mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) or m-learning which is defined as learning with mobile devices that can be utilized in any place that is equipped with unbroken transmission signals[1] has created new opportunities and challenges for educational use. It introduced a new learning model combining new types of mobile devices, wireless communication services and technologies with teaching and learning. Recent advancements in the mobile world such as the Apple IOS devices (IPhone, IPod Touch and IPad), Android devices and other smartphone devices and environments (such as Windows Phone 7and Blackberry), allowed learning to be more flexible inside and outside the classroom, making the learning experience unique, adaptable and tailored to each user [2]. Creativity, learner autonomy, collaboration and digital practices of language learners are encouraged as well as innovative pedagogical applications, like the flipped classroom, for such practices in classroom contexts are enhanced. These developments are gradually embedded in daily life and they also seem to be heralding the sustainable move to paperless classrooms. Since these varied digital technologies are increasingly viewed as a main platform for delivery, we as educators need to design our activities, materials and learning environments in such a way to ensure that learners are engaged and feel comfortable. This paper presents how apps (for Apple devices) can be integrated into teaching and learning in higher education. Current Approaches to MALL The use of mobile devices in education has become common across all educational sectors and the range of research into the use of mobile communication technologies for the purposes of language learning has been diverse. This is motivated by a search for effective pedagogical innovations and educational applications of new media since classroom instruction needs to constantly adapt to new technologies and interests. As mobile learning has gradually gained popularity, several researchers have attempted to develop models and frameworks to explain where and how mobile learning fits within the context of education to support various kinds of learning. Pereira and Rodrigues [3] presented “the evolution of the learning models” where mobile learning is the most recent model, which reduces the limitations of the previous models. Fig. 1. The evolution of the learning models [3] Naismith, Lonsdale, Vavoula and Sharples’ report [4] stated that mobile devices can support traditional pedagogical approaches as well as contemporary approaches. In their literature review, Viberg and Gronlund [5] found that the theories and models applied on MALL mostly derive from previous theories of learning such as constructivism and social constructivism. With a constructivist approach to learning, learners actively generate ideas or concepts based on their current knowledge and build on what they already know as they are encouraged to collaborate with peers to do so. Project-based learning, a constructivist approach, allows mobile technology integration in meaningful ways so that learners can explore and develop content purposefully and engage in authentic problem-based, casebased and inquiry-based learning using the most efficient mobile applications and tools such as mobile investigations or casual games. A more recent development is Siemens’ theory of “connectivism” [6] which is described as “..including technology and connection making as learning activities begins to move learning theories into a digital age”. Combining connectivism with constructivist approaches offers learners an opportunity to achieve 21 st century skills such as technology-mediated multi tasking. Blended-learning approach [7] is another way to integrate mobile technology applications into classroom practice by using Learning Management System Apps or Personal Learning Environments such as blogs. The flipped classroom, where the sequence of activities or assignments is rearranged so learners watch teacher created videos outside the classroom so that they spend more time for practice in class, is conceptually grounded in active learning and student engagement theories and is made effective with MALL applications. Given that mobile technology devices and tools are still rather new and developing, using an integrated pedagogy in ways that support engagement of learners should be the driving force behind our classroom practice. MALL Apps in Language Learning Mobile technology involves the use of portable devices that are also embedded in our daily lives, such as mobile phones, smart phones, tablet PCs and other hand-held gadgets and the fact that learners are already using communication facilities and technology-related activities such as content creation on their portable gadgets has contributed to teachers’ efforts to integrate them into teaching and learning. These screen-based technologies are significant in educational technology as they provide many advantages like mobility of the learners and flexibility of the learning environment, connectivity and accessibility to materials, authenticity, creativity and collaborative learning. With MALL, learners are able to combine the advantages of the Internet with personalized and ongoing learning activities anytime, anywhere. Ally [8] describes mobile learning as “powerful support for effective learning and performance-based assessment”. Since the arrival of Apple IPhone in 2007 and the IPad in 2010, a wide range of MALL applications have been developed which are intended to enhance the learning process, create a learner-centred environment and focus on the ongoing process of learning rather than the end result. Learners increasingly lead tech-filled lives outside the classroom and mobile apps offer the ability to capture the full attention of the learners with full customization in regards to personal preferences and differentiation. There are a lot of apps available for carrying out a variety of tasks from media creation to productivity."

New approaches to ‘knowledge by technology’ are changing both teachers’ and learners’ roles, responding to their different aims and needs. At the same time, nearly 4 million people are presently involved in massive migration processes all over Europe, coming either from outside Europe or from another EU member state. The EU policies on migrants state the importance of a basic knowledge of the host country’s language, history and institutions for an effective integration process, and EU governments are expected to contribute to this aim. This paper describes the European Project ‘L-PACK: Citizenship Language Pack For Migrants in Europe’ (2011-2016), whose main aim consisted in developing a series of internet video texts, accompanied with materials and resources to lead adult migrants to A2 level (according to QCER levels scale) in different EU languages. The project has been developed in two main stages. In the first part of the programme, called L-Pack 1, from 2011 to 2013, the languages were Italian, Spanish, German, Lithuanian, Greek and Czech. In the second part, called L-Pack 2 extended, from 2014 to 2016, the project added English and French and was integrated with new resources and tools. The L-PACK course, which consists of 60 short video dialogues from everyday life, supported by comprehension activities and linguistic explanation and rules, is totally free and available through Youtube, Wikibooks and Soundcloud. The dedicated website http://www.l-pack.eu was visited by 120.000 users from 146 countries in the period 2011-2016. L-Pack teaching materials have also been used by teachers in classroom activities. The authors analyze and evaluate the results of the L-Pack Project, from pilot to dissemination, in different learning contexts both in situ and through e-learning. This is carried out on the basis of surveys concerning the project as a whole and in particular its use in Italian language teaching classes for migrants in Italy."

Although research in this area is relatively scarce, recent studies suggest that rising numbers of five- to eight-year-olds engage in the use of digital devices and that Internet games are increasingly targeted to younger audiences. Some theorists caution about the impact of violent imagery and unrealistic media-based depictions of people and relationships, whereas others propose that digital technologies offer new opportunities for autonomy, personal expression, and community with online peers. The following questions arise: as the boundary between real and virtual play grows porous, do digital games fall within the realm of make-believe play and serve the developmental functions of solitary and shared pretense? Might the highly stimulating, fast-paced, and immediately gratifying na…"

While the “official” Sanders organization built applications to transform supporters into a tightly controlled distribution network for its social media messaging, this was complemented by “unofficial” grassroots networks that circulated more informal and culturally oriented appeals. The latter are classified according to the models of organizationally enabled and self-organized connective action in digital social movements, with structural differences in oversight and moderation that suggest varying levels of creative autonomy for citizens and reputational risk for the associated campaigns."

The writers refine their conceptualisations of student-direction, different to, but flowing from student-centred learning, by scrutinising a progressive series of face-to-face examples offering some autonomy in learning. Nine features are identified as essential in a student-directed programme. They review Garrison’s recent account of learning-centred Communities of Inquiry (CoI), identifying aspects of the teacher/instructor’s role that would need to be altered for student-directed online communities. Guidelines are suggested for creating a student-directed CoI including programme design addressing the development, and use, of generic abilities. Finally, the writers provide an example programme structure incorporating preparation of learners for the respon…"

However, despite the fulfilment of such necessary conditions, there are situations where the telemedicine still fails to settle as a system due to low receptivity of stakeholders.\nIntroduction: This study plans to first analyse the stakeholders’ resistance to an organisation’s implementation of telemedicine. By focusing on the medical professionals’ interests, we aim to propose a strategy to minimise their conflicts and improve their acceptance.\nMaterials and methods: The Delphi study was carried out on 190 telemedicine professionals, whom have been recommended by 480 telemedicine-related personnel in South Korea.\nResults: Out of 190 professionals, 60% of enrolled participants completed the final questionnaires. The stakeholders were categorised into groups including policy making officials, medical professionals, patients and industrialists. Amongst these, the majority of the medical professionals opposed to the execution of telemedicine. The main causes of such opposition were found to be the lack of medical delivery system and the threat of disruption of the primary care units. The consensus amongst stakeholders revealed low and in order to facilitate the smooth agreements, each expert presented the similar conditions such as the financial support by the government and the guarantee of medical autonomy.\nConclusion: The analysis of the causes of the resistance of telemedicine, extracted from the concerned parties, has important implications for the policy-makers to derive strategies for an appropriate consensus."

HIV seropositive patients use the Web as a tool for searching information, meeting other Web users and developing social networks. In July 2008, taking advantage of the advent of Web technology 2.0, AIDES, a non-profit organization dedicated to fighting AIDS, launched Seronet, a website premised on a communitarian objective that aims to improve access to knowledge, provide a forum for sharing individual experience of the disease and break the cycle of isolation. Despite certain limitations, a relatively wide support network has gradually developed around Seronet. The long-term impact of this network on isolation, the development of autonomy, and the encouragement of a communitarian involvement of HIV-positive patients in terms of healthcare will need to be assessed."

Nonetheless, such limitations, if any, must not be left unnoticed. Indisputably, notions of “success” and “failure” are indeed highly subjective issues. The outcome of something as difficult and complex to achieve as government reform, or higher levels of civic engagement by means of electronic medium, may not be sensed immediately. These agencies must also be ready to transform mindsets, systems, and processes even if this may decrease their autonomy. Boundaries, silos, and counters will have to be torn down and done away as clients move online. Communications with the government via e-mails and other electronic channels will be made a mere routine norm, delivered to the public clients any time of the day across any time zone and in any continent. The implementation of a fully connected Malaysian government also requires empowering the government workforce. Bureaucratic agencies must focus their interest to empowering employees by providing them the tools to perform and deliver their duties better and from any workspace. Therefore, there is an urgent need to make human capital planning a strategic element in the agencies’ initiatives. An effective and fully connected Malaysian e-Government initiative poses challenges on how they might devise policies to spur and inspire local innovation and on how they might integrate which technology to achieve their objectives to a greater degree. Key words: e-Government, Malaysian nation-state, Information and Communication Technology, bureaucratic reform, and effective management. About the Authors: Azizan H.

From 2013 to 2016, several actions were developed by the research group to contribute to research on collaborative learning, co-creation, open education and open educational resources, due to a partnership with the Collaborative Open Learning Community (coLearn) under the coordination of Dr. Alexandra Okada. In this context, the question to this investigation was as follows: how can open educational resources (OER) development on Higher Education in a collaborative process of co-creation contribute to student learning? The aim of this study was to promote a collaborative and open educational experience for students through the creation of OER as well as the incorporation of Facebook, YouTube and Whats App as supporting environments in the teaching and learning process. Based on the analysis of the obtained results, it was observed that this experience was positive for contributing to the knowledge production in a collaborative way, with criticality, autonomy and creativity. And also, the students experienced an innovative methodology, allowing those who already act as professors to reflect on their pedagogical practice."

The study focused on the use of synchronous Chat in teaching and learning. Collaborative learning is considered to lead to a deeper level of learning, enhanced critical thinking, shared understanding and long-term recognition of the learned material. A qualitative approach was used in the data collection process. Participants were 20 high school students, native speakers of Arabic, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The study examined participants’ English usage in conversation, a quiz, and a discussion, all of which took place online, in a CMC format. There was also a paired work presentation of 25 minutes’ duration. Results revealed that CMC enabled learners to further their understanding of instructional content and to better apply what they had learned when they were placed in a group. The results from the online discussion showed that participants’ linguistic performance improved, including better utilization of words. Although grammatical usages lack certain accuracy, the use of CMC to a larger extent contributed to enhanced communication skills and autonomy. Based on the findings some suggestions and recommendations were provided as to aid teachers as well as students in implementing the Internet technology in EFL classrooms."

Graber \n Eliyakim Hershkop \n Rachel Ilana Graber \nAccess to information is critical to a patient’s valid exercise of autonomy. One increasingly important source of medical information is the Internet. Individuals often turn to drug company (“pharma”) websites to look for drug information.The objective of this study was to determine whether there is information on pharma websites that is embargoed: Is there information that is hidden from the patient unless she attests to being a health care provider? We discuss the implications of our findings for health care ethics.We reviewed a convenience sample of 40 pharma websites for “professionals-only” areas and determined whether access to those areas was restricted, requiring attestation that the user is a health care professional in the United States.Of the 40 websites reviewed, 38 had information that was labeled for health care professionals-only. Of these, 24 required the user to certify their status as a health care provider before they were able to access this “hidden” information.Many pharma websites include information in a “professionals-only” section. Of these, the majority require attestation that the user is a health care professional before they can access the information. This leaves patients with two bad choices: (1) not accessing the information or (2) lying about being a health care professional. Both of these outcomes are unacceptable. In the first instance, the patient’s access to information is limited, potentially impairing their health and their ability to make reasonable and well-informed decisions. In the second instance, they may be induced to lie in a medical setting. “Teaching” patients to lie may have adverse consequences for the provider-patient relationship."

The paper actualizes the notion of media and professional autonomy, introduces the Western tradition of journalistic culture and considers the decisions being made and how they affect professional independence in Lithuanian newsrooms. The practical research part of this piece mostly focuses on newsrooms operating online. Based on the findings of the research conducted on the relationships of business and government structures with the media, and the data of the survey of editors and journalists, it can be stated that several factors affect the autonomy of newsrooms and journalists of Lithuanian internet portals: 1) the owners of a media outlet; 2) the political and business interests of the owners; 3) an absence of ethical norms, such as documents regulating professional activities; 4) an absence of mechanisms for feedback and resolution of conflicts of interests; 5) a lack of transparency and impartiality in internet portals; 6) political and business interests; 7) the hierarchical structure of an editorial office. An analysis of the information about owners and documents published in internet portals revealed that the editorial offices either do not provide any information about the shareholders (owners) altogether or this information is provided to the general public in a laconic and sleek manner. Regardless of the fact that some of the portals provide information that shareholders do not interfere with the work of the editorial office, none of them referred to a mechanism for dissociating the editorial office from the interests of the owners (shareholders). The portals do not provide information about the mechanisms for resolving conflicts (between the readers and the newsroom) operated in the newsrooms. Moreover, there is no information on how the conflicts of editors and journalists pertaining to professional ethics are resolved. The majority of newsrooms (except for Delfi.lt) do not familiarize readers with their work culture. The survey of the journalists and editors of internet media outlets revealed that the newsrooms are not sufficiently autonomous – the majority of those surveyed do not think they work in autonomous newsrooms. The lack of autonomy of newsrooms of the internet portals was also corroborated by the fact that there are topics avoided by journalists and editors alike. Generally, they are associated with competitors, politicians or business structures, advertising customers and the interests of owners. It can be assumed, based on the corpus of the replies given by editors and journalists, that a strong hierarchical structure prevails in editorial offices influencing the individual autonomy of journalists. The overall analysis of the journalist replies shows that the journalists do not complete the texts themselves (texts are corrected; titles are changed). Although the corrections are coordinated with the journalists, the editors make the final decision concerning them. Moreover, the lack of professional autonomy of the journalists is also shown by the fact that journalists are commissioned to write articles, whereas certain articles are removed from the internet space."

This paper adds to the growing scholarship on citizen journalism by exploring the motivations of Indian citizen journalists to produce online news content. Through a Web-based survey of citizen journalists (N = 134) contributing to the leading news portals in India, this study addresses the role of traditional media experience among citizen journalists’ reporting practices. One of the key findings of this study is that, unlike American citizen journalists, Indian citizen journalists who have not worked in traditional media are less likely to work collaboratively than those with traditional media experience."

This article addresses the sense of the changes, recognized in international experience, in our context, centrally inquiring about: what kind of social implications takes place due to the growth of activities in companies in the sectors of creative economy? It starts from the recognition that economic action finds itself immersed in a set of mechanisms of social mediation. Data were obtained on a purposeful sample of fourteen small enterprises belonging to this economy in the city of Porto Alegre, complementing with documentary sources. The study suggests that this type of business tends to be guided by the pursuit of novelty, complementarity of knowledge, professional autonomy and responsibility with the environment, within the limits of the social and institutional conditions in which they take part.

The commitment to evolving ideas is a cornerstone of academia, informing the varied teaching and learning spaces we occupy as well as the professional spaces where we collaborate, share, and learn: from faculty lounges to hallways, from conferences to journals, from handwritten correspondences to emails, blogs, and tweets. 21st century technologies continue to multiply, affording us an ever expanding arena of modalities and methods to refine and impart our intellectual craftsmanship as scholars and as faculty developers. Faculty developers can benefit from the insights, methods, and examples of the unconference as a powerful platform for imagining and crafting dynamic and potentially transformative faculty learning experiences (West, 2012).The unconference is powerful because of the rate at which ideas can be generated and shared; because the unconference celebrates autonomy and encourages the emergence of our personal narratives; because the unconference challenges traditional notions of learning space redefining the locations, relationships and by which we communicate and build understanding; and because of the unconference’s democratic-participatory structure (Association for Learning Technology; Kassner, 2014). The unconference is an arena of possibilities that organically build off the very foundations that drive those interested in developing knowledge to connect with others. Conceived as such, the unconference can substantively inform and inspire new directions for the future of faculty development so that the field continues to remain programmatically relevant, agile, and exciting.With the spirit of exploration in mind, this paper discusses the what, why, and how of unconferencing and probes its implications as a transformative approach to faculty development in higher education. The paper examines theory that informs the unconference, canvasses resources and tools that can be used to organize and build unconference learning experiences, and highlights ways the unconference can prompt critical reflection among faculty. To this end, best practices and strategies are offered, including reference to web-based resources that may assist in preparations for unconference experiences. Moreover, the authors discuss the importance of and methods for networking stakeholders as a practical means by which to set strong foundations for unconferencing to take place and become valued on institutional campuses. Three iterations of unconferencing as modes for substantively engaging faculty are examined as a practical basis for considering implications of the unconference on the future of faculty development.What is an Unconference and How is it Different?‘Unconferences’ are a non-traditional form of professional activity defined by the absence of many conventional conference structures (Carpenter, 2015, p. 78). Stated differently, ‘Unconferences’ are voluntary, informal learning experiences that reject traditional conference such as a predetermined slate of speakers and sessions (Boule, 2011). Unconferences manifest themselves in different ways, yet all share common principles and structures. At its core, unconference events are participant driven. From topics to participation, from goals to agendas, the unconference works to organically surface interests and problems relevant to those attending, provide a place for them to work, and relies on the contributions of each participant to move group defined goals forward. The unconference approach is in direct contrast to traditional academic conference that exemplify more didactic modes of engagement.To a large extent, attending a [traditional] conference can be a passive experience (Sweeting & Hohl, 2015, p. 2). The roots of dominant conference formats date back to the 1660’s when travel and copies of physical manuscripts posed challenging obstacles to sharing knowledge. …"

This paper aims at exploring the student experiences in collaborative learning using social media tools in a blended learning course. Through the in-depth exploration of the individual student interviews, the paper attempts to provide an example on the use of social media tools in learning for the institutes to plan for the learning needs due to changes on online technology. The study results confirmed the students engaged in learning through use of social media. It was found that the collaborative learning using social media tools in the course was not instructed by the teachers but was initiated by the students. The collaboration was a non-prescribed activity. This study proposes that social dimension of learning autonomy, could be considered in the community of inquiry framework."

Instead, Communion must ask what quality of intra- and inter-ecclesial relationality is appropriate for Christian community and measure against it. An ecclesiology founded upon an anticipated eschatology, an approach familiar to Anglican theology and practice, provides a framework for this assessment. Five characteristics of eschatological ecclesiology and quality of relationality it promotes are advanced. Aided by Inter-Anglican Theological and Doctrinal Commission’s report Communion, Conflict and Hope and work of Bruce Kaye, it is shown that ecclesiological values of Windsor Report and its resultant are at odds with those that arise from an eschatological ecclesiology, providing an opening for Communion to resolve its covenant conundrum. Being a global family of autonomous churches, not a worldwide church itself, Anglican Communion does not have a central figure or body that makes decisions or promulgates doctrine for all Anglican churches. It is not hierarchical authority that unifies Anglican Communion, but of that derive from a shared history and identity and that grow from inter-ecclesial fellowship and partnerships, common life and witness, and Communion-wide gatherings, formal and informal, on multiple levels. Recent events in Communion stemming from fierce disagreements over role of same-gender sexuality in determining eligibility for ordination have greatly strained those bonds of affection, raising issues of provincial autonomy and interdependence, proper exercise of theological and ecclesia! authority, and appropriate levels of diversity within Communion. Central to each of these issues is question of relationship. The present crisis is fundamentally about how relational bonds of affection uniting churches of Anglican Communion are to be understood and lived. Perceiving this, Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury, convened Lambeth Commission on Communion in 2003 and charged it with reporting back to him on the canonical understandings of communion, impaired and broken communion, and ways in which provinces of Anglican Communion may relate to one another in situations where ecclesiastical authorities of one province feel unable to maintain fullness of communion with another part of Anglican Communion.1 The result was Windsor Report, and one of its key practical recommendations was development of an Anglican Communion that would outline Anglican identity and make explicit and forceful loyalty and bonds of affection which govern relationships between churches of Communion.2 Championed by Archbishop, a Communion- wide process was launched,3 producing a series of draft covenants and extensive debate about them in provincial and Communion bodies, parish and diocesan meetings, journal articles and books, and Anglican blogosphere. As a relational response to a relational crisis, it is not surprising that supporters and opponents of version of now before member churches of Communion for adoption tend to debate advisability of endorsing it in relational terms.4 Thematically, five broad questions with relational implications appear to dominate discourse around covenant: extent to which it is confessional, contractual, conservative, centralizing, and punitive. An honest appraisal reveals a degree of truth on both sides of each question: is and is not confessional, contractual, conservative, centralizing, and punitive. This ambivalence means that answering these extremely important questions cannot be decisive test for whether to adopt covenant. …"

Francyne Huckaby \n Pamela Konkol \nThe Context of Worth Striking For Isabel NunezI WAS A FIRST GRADE TEACHER in Southern California in the early 1990s, and it was the most fulfilling work I’ve ever done. This was back in the days before curriculum standardization-or even standards; my first graders took one standardized test a year and the results were only used to help us teach them better. I spent 5 years abroad and returned to an educational landscape that was nearly unrecognizable.My current students, who are teaching now, have a hard time imagining what this was like: the freedom and autonomy that I enjoyed in my classroom. My graduate students will sometimes ask me ‘What did you do at staff meetings?’ Well, we did have staff meetings, and we did complain about how long they were, but we did NOT analyze test score data. We had the luxury of talking about students as people, not as numbers.From No Child Left Behind to the current push for teacher evaluation via test scores and ranking, it has been a really tough decade or so to be an educator. Every few weeks brings another devastating discovery, whether a new round of school closures or a ridiculous-sounding idea from a conservative think tank-which by now we’ve learned is likely to turn up as a serious policy proposal. I used to laugh at these, but now I tremble.Watching all the dots connect has been worse still: It’s not well-intentioned error; it’s a strategic assault on public education as an enterprise. Most recently, the offensive has been targeted at teachers themselves. I’m already seeing the signs of despair in my graduate students as the public discourse casts teachers as enemy number one-even while high-stakes testing makes it harder to actually teach. The efforts to undermine teachers’ unions and tenure, programs like Teach for America which ask just a few years’ commitment to the classroom: All of these point in one direction. If the reform movement is successful, teaching will no longer be a career, but a job-and a low-paid, temporary one at that. Since for most teachers, neither of these is an adequate descriptor for what is truly a vocation, the struggle in which we are now engaged is for our very survival as professionals.I was feeling demoralized, disillusioned, and dangerously close to despair in 2012. There is very little exaggeration when I say that the Chicago teachers’ strike saved my life. Being in Chicago then, as the city’s teachers took to the streets, was transformative. The summer vote by Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) members authorizing the strike garnered more than 90% of Chicago teachers’ approval. It flew in the face of a statutory requirement that 75% of members authorize a strike-a legislative move that was designed to be debilitating to teachers’ unions. In fact, Jonah Edelman, the astroturf reform group Stand for Children CEO, had bragged in Aspen that he’d succeeding in ensuring that the CTU would never strike. He envisioned a state-by-state capitulation that would neutralize the power of unions nationwide. Well, the teachers had something to say about that.During the strike itself, teachers showed incredible courage and dignity, never flinching in their support of their students and their schools-this despite the threat to their bank accounts and the attacks on their already battered reputations. One of my own students shared how she cried as she read the callously critical comments on the strike from some Facebook ‘friends’ - until just then she saw herself on the news in front of Chicago Public Schools (CPS) headquarters and was re-energized. As the strike came to a close, CTU president Karen Lewis explained that this is not just about teachers, connecting the event to the wider struggle for basic fairness to workers, a fight that is only intensifying.This was our inspiration for writing Worth Striking For: Why Education Policy is Every Teacher ’s Concern. Pamela Konkol, Gregory Michie, and I initially proposed a book of education history on the strike to Teachers College Press. …"

By highlighting the network structure and discursive meaning making of the #GirlsLikeUs network, we argue that the digital labor of trans women, especially trans women of color, represents the vanguard of struggles over self-definition. We find that trans women on Twitter, led by Janet Mock and Laverne Cox, and in response to histories of misrepresentation and ongoing marginalization and violence, deliberately curate an intersectional networked counterpublic that works to legitimize and support trans identities and advocate for trans autonomy in larger publics and counterpublics."

The problematizing question is to what extent our teaching practice in distance education distracts the teacher from his praxis? We start from the assumption that it is necessary to understand the dimension of the process of proletarianization, alienation, wich distances the teacher from his praxis, that is, from his autonomy in class preparation, from content management and also human relations with his students, in order to evaluate the consequences for the educator. After all. it is discussed the context of cyberculture, wich requires a new practice in virtual space and time for online education."

The ELP is based on the Common European Framework (CEF) Reference Levels that enable learners to describe what they can do in different languages. The CEF is a Council of Europe initiative aimed at improving the learning of foreign languages. This paper uses the internet to look at how the ELP has been implemented in different settings and to suggest how the ELP may be approached. The paper introduces a small-scale case study of ELP pilot implementation in a university preparatory school. The results from this institution show many similarities with responses in other places, and demonstrate the importance of integrating the ELP with the existing programme, providing teacher training and clarifying the status and purpose of the ELP. Analysis of documents on the internet shows a number of important factors. The most successful examples of ELP use involved integration of the ELP in the institution’s programme, training for teachers and students and a high level of commitment of time and financial resources by teachers and administrators. Responses from teachers were often extremely positive, others showed interest but many also expressed reservations about the ELP. Student responses were generally but not universally positive and a number of criticisms were raised concerning the status and purpose of the ELP. The paper provides full internet links so readers can access the same documents. The paper concludes firstly that future ELP use could exploit the internet for teacher training and secondly that thorough preparation of staff, students and programmes are needed when an innovative tool such as ELP is introduced. The basis for thorough preparation could involve detailed familiarisation with the CEF Reference Levels."

On the Internet, this kind of participation has developed new possibilities in relation with the administration feedback, accessibility and flexibility or cost savings, for example (Juris, 2005). In essentially Anglo- Saxon countries, political powers have developed platforms to manage this form of participation, such as the Scottish Parliament, the Bundestag, or Norwegian municipalities (Lindner & Riehm, 2011). However, in Spain these initiatives have had to be channeled through private alternatives. The aim of this paper is to explore the relationship between Change.org, which is one of these sites, to define its operation and confront the formal features of each of the models. To achieve these goals, we performed a qualitative content analysis of the website of Change.org. We analyze the process of creating and signing petitions, the discussion forums, the structure of the home page and the user possibilities to contact the members of the page. The results of the field work show different results on Change regarding public platforms of e-petitions. Thus, this tool for petitions noted for its simple design and its instructions and user guides that facilitate quick and easy participation by users. However, limited spaces of deliberation and scanty possibilities of contact with Change.org team and users distance the page to a public model of online petitions."

Two methods of data collection were employed; content analysis of the Facebook interactions, and semi structured interviews. Four main learning preferences or characteristics of online activities are identified; a) teacher-led activities (tasks and learning content provided by teachers), b) teachers’ presence (one or two authority figures to facilitate learning and keep group lively), c) topics or content (entertainment-oriented, grammar quizzes, opinion-based discussions), d) structure of the group (optional and ungraded). The passive participants found the activity beneficial in improving their online communication ability, while the more active participants felt a boost of confidence to use English in a more public space like Facebook. The findings indicate that the students are in need of technological changes in learning, but are dependent on teachers’ instructions to initiate the process. They exert selective interests in learning topics and content, and demonstrate partial autonomy in negotiating the online group’s structure. The theoretical and practical implications, and recommendation for future research are briefly presented."

Email: mpiskunov@eu.spb.ru This paper is devoted to the micropolitics of late-Soviet factory and employs the case of the Vyborg Pulp and Paper Factory in the mid‑1980s to shed light on the theoretical approaches of Alf Luedtke and Donald Filtzer, who adapted Harry Braverman’s labour process theory to soviet productive relationships. The failure of the Vyborg plant to meet plan targets led the upper management to follow Andropov-era policies in 1982–85 to raise labour discipline among workers. The upper management failed this task because of the passive resistance of plant line and shop floor managers. My main conclusion is what interfered with the objectives of the upper management most of all was the existence of a high level of autonomy between the key social-technological groups in the soviet enterprise. This elevated the role of low and middle level managers, and it was their intermediate position between workers and upper management that gave them such a strong influence. Sociologists such as Simon Clarke and Vladimir Yadov reached similar conclusions on the role of line and shop floor managers during research into the organization of labor within post-soviet factories during the market reforms of the 1990s. My research allows us to interpret this phenomenon as a consequence of specific Soviet productive relationships, which have not, in all likelihood, been fundamentally changed by Russia’s market reforms but even reinforced. Thus, the existence of forms of social inequality and power distribution within soviet industrial enterprises led to the distortion of Fordist (inspired by Taylor system) models of management, used by the Soviet authorities and the new industrial private owners alike. This explains the independent behavior of this group, a feature recognized by sociologists such as Simon Clarke in the 1990’s."

Weak capacity of rural government impact on law implementation failure that led to the poor rural village development. This study examines these issues. This study used qualitative research methods. The unit of analysis of this research that the village government Landungsari Dau District of Malang, East Java. This study was conducted over three years (2016, 2017, 2018). The findings of the research during the last four months in the first year of the study is Landungsari village administration showed a good performance in governance at the village of village autonomy era (the era of the Village Law.

Nevertheless, the village government also faces serious problems is the lack of human resource capacity of the village administration, village very less quantity, and village officials do not understand the duties of each. To address these issues, the village government seeks to organize village governance based on information technology (e-government), but the effort has not worked well because the village government does not have a human resources professional in the field of information technology and the village government does not have enough budget to develop the e-government program. Therefore, the research team conducting FGD on the development of e-government program.

Step next phase is the research team conducting FGD Phase II to design e-government as a means of governance villages effective and efficient, to disseminate the e-government, and publishes scientific articles on the model of governance based rural e-government in the Journal of Politics and Government Muhammadiyah University of Yogyakarta. Our advice as a researcher is a village government should make regulations governing Internet-based mechanism of public services (e-government). The regulation is to encourage villagers Landungsari to get used to using services based on the Internet, the district government of Malang should provide support to the village government to make innovations in governance, and the central government should support the village government to strengthen rural government institutions such as the addition of the village"

But how can knowledge be retained with fast staff turnover, global project-based work and parental leaves? Using enterprise social media to improve knowledge dissemination at work seems promising, when looking at the success of private social networking sites. In this article we combine ten different empirical studies which investigated different aspects of how user diversity influences the motivation to use social media at work. The emerging meta-study using the DerSimonian—Laird method (total sample size \\[N=522\\]N=522) analyzes different aspects of user diversity and their correlation with eight motives for SNS usage: information, importance, contact, self-presentation, autonomy, social comparison, and power and control. We found that that the individual achievement motivation correlates positively with the motives importance, power, information and self-presentation. The need for autonomy correlates with openness to new experiences and the need for social comparison with gender and neuroticism. From our findings, we derive practical implications for designing a social networking site for work which fulfills the users’ needs and functions along their motivation."

Yeoh \n Yi’En Cheng \nSingapore has one of the tightest regulations over assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) in Asia, a consequence of Singapore’s strong state, the priority it gives to reproduction, and the numerous religious groups in the country and their direct and indirect influence on the Bioethics Advisory Committee, which recommends ART regulations for the country. Together, these key actors give shape to the ‘local moral worlds’, which undergird ART governance in the country. Drawing on in-depth interviews and data from online forums, we illustrate Singaporean fertility seekers’ attempts to juggle myriad and sometimes confusing obligations to the state, society and religion in making reproductive choices. We then explore the limits and possibilities for fertility seekers to circumvent the restrictive rules and ‘moral safety valves’ set in place in their home country simply by stepping out to another jurisdiction across national borders. The paper goes on to show how the Internet communities serve as a bridgespace, propelling fertility mobilities by enabling Singaporeans to see creative possibilities in patchwork regulations. At the edges of state and religious power, fertility-seeking subjects take advantage of liminal spaces, grey areas, or permissive regimes to gain several degrees of freedom to practise adaptive fertility strategies that may be ‘unofficial’ but ‘licit’ or ‘socially acceptable’."

Waldron \nEmerging adults are encountering a developmental stage in a polymediated world that brings autonomy, intimacy, and identity to the forefront of their transition from adolescence to adulthood. This study focuses on traditionally-aged college students who are deeply immersed with digital technology and communication as a primary method to communicate and interact with peers, partners, teachers, and family members. To understand the relationship between digital communication and emerging adulthood, researchers facilitated a qualitative study grounded in ethnomethodological and dramaturgical perspective to uncover the unique ways in which college students make sense of their social media during this developmental time period. Data collection occurred through nine focus groups; in all, 44 undergraduate students participated. Findings illustrate four relevant patterns to the development of emerging adults: a key rationale for use among participants that is tied to both ritualized behavior and institutional constraints; the importance of autonomy with their digital communication use that is often stifled by parental access to their mediated lives; the presentation of an identity that is rooted in norms of acceptable use; and the importance of digital communication to the development and maintenance of connections to family, friends, and intimate partners. Implications for further research are discussed."

The paper also aims to establish the mediating effects of SSR and CI on PE.\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe sample size for the study was 319 employees (197 managers and 122 team leaders) from ten leading information and communication technology companies of India. Structural equation modelling was used to test the model under study. Bootstrapping was applied to provide better estimation of the sample.\nFindings\nThe exogenous variables under study were autonomy and openness. The mediating variables were SSR and CI. Results supported the model and indicated a significant direct effect between exogenous variables and PE. The role of SSR and CI as mediator was also ascertained.\nPractical implications\nThe paper highlights that the managers of service organisations should take initiatives to provide a conducive climate for innovation. Having the right climate for innovation and support from superiors will make employees feel psychologically empowered.\nOriginality/value\nAlthough as researchers and as practitioners the authors understand the importance of innovation climate and role of superior, few studies have sought to explain the mediating effects of SSR and CI."

Britt \n Anton Sytine \n Ashley R Brady \n Russ Wilkes \n Rebecca A Pittman \n Kristen S. Jennings \n Kandice N. Goguen \nNumerous authors have identified the stressors likely to be encountered on long duration space exploration missions (e.g., to Mars), including the possibility of significant crises, separation from family, boredom/monotony, and interpersonal conflict. Although many authors have noted that meaningful work may be beneficial for astronauts on these missions, none have detailed the sources of meaningful work for astronauts and how these sources may differ between astronauts. The present article identifies how engagement in meaningful work during long duration missions may mitigate the adverse effects of demands and increase the potential for benefits resulting from the missions.Semistructured interviews were conducted with nine NASA personnel, including astronauts, flight directors, and flight surgeons. Questions addressed sources of meaning for astronauts, characteristics of tasks that enhance vs. detract from meaning, and recommendations for enhancing meaning.Personnel mentioned contributing to humanity and the next generation, contributing to the mission, and exploration as the most meaningful aspects of their work. Characteristics of tasks that enhanced meaning included using a variety of skills, feeling personal control over their schedule, autonomy in the execution of tasks, and understanding the importance of the experiments conducted on the mission. Top recommendations to sustain meaning were insuring social needs were met through such activities as the strategic use of social media, giving astronauts autonomy as well as structure, and conducting training during transit.Implications are addressed for tailoring meaning-based interventions for astronauts participating on long duration missions and assessing the effectiveness of these interventions.Britt TW, Sytine A, Brady A, Wilkes R, Pittman R, Jennings K, Goguen K.

The research considers that the public sphere of this kind of digital community transforms the “Half acquaintance society” into “acquaintances society” and constructs the rural endogenous order. Its essence is the new media empower the village elite outside the system to form a social-media-based alliance, and with the village idle staff, left-behind women and other people to form the media self-organizing, become a new village endogenous power. The elite alliance of outside institutions, through express in the public sphere, media mobilization, public action, and so on, connected the scattered in different space of “atomic” villagers, promote the development of rural society. With the change of the village power structure, the elite alliance of the outside system and the village of the state agent have formed a competitive relationship, temporarily formed a relatively balanced cooperative governance model. The public sphere of the digital community makes villages from the nominal villager autonomy to the autonomy mode of “self-management, self-education and self-service” through the public participation of the villagers."

Benedetti \nHistorically, parents looking for guidance turned to a small cadre of trusted individuals such as grandparents and pediatricians. In the Internet era, this paradigm has shifted. With a few keystrokes, anxious parents have access to a seemingly endless array of opinions from faceless sources with unknown agendas. For some parents, this can cause more uncertainty, and for the parents of a child with a medical condition, navigating this information can be overwhelming.\nIn this modern paradigm, the pediatrician’s duty has also become more complex, especially with the shift from paternalism to patient autonomy in medical decision-making. It is within this context that Alan Fleischman’s book, Pediatric Ethics: Protecting the Interests of Children, should be examined. A pediatrician and neonatologist, Fleischman has witnessed this evolution over more than five decades of practice. As a clinical and academic bioethicist, he has also witnessed a transformation in the field of bioethics, with shifting perspectives on areas such as research ethics and medical decision-making. Because of his rich experience and deep understanding of the past and present of ethical issues in pediatrics, Fleischman approaches this subject with a perspective that warrants attention and thoughtful consideration."

Learners’ self-control is directly influenced by the ways in which educators execute their work, including their instructional explanations, their classroom management, and the expectations that they express to their learners. Our research on this phenomenon investigated Finnish and Swedish learners in upper secondary schools. Not only is the use of digital technology very different in these two countries; the autonomy and status of educators are as well. This article compares the empirical significance of antecedents of learners’ academic self-control in the two national settings by surveying 2191 learners in Swedish and Finnish schools. Our analysis applies structural equation modeling to two cross-sectional datasets, and the results reveal that the associations between educators’ instructional explanations, classroom management, and their high expectations on the one hand and learners’ academic self-control on the other are stronger overall among Finnish students than among Swedish students. Furthermore, the association between digital technology use and learners’ perceptions of conflict between school norms and Internet opportunities are much stronger in the Swedish sample than the Finnish sample. Lastly, we discuss the meaning of these results and their possible implications for research and practice."

Data were collected through interviews, observation and documentation. Data was analyzed by using qualitative data analysis Spradley models which was brought into line to the data analysis techniques in the research stage. The results showed that the regional development of science and technology policy for Bengkulu Province has two agenda namely science and technology to pave the backwardness and science and technology for prosperity. Those agendas were focused on the field of food security, energy, technology and transportation management, information and communication technology, security and defense technology, medical technology and medicine, and technology management of natural resources and the environment.Keywords: Autonomy, National Aspirations, Science And Technology Development, Indonesia"

On the ground of this investigation, a context description of SAC in university levels is put forward followed by an overt statement of the objectives and the rationales of the study. There are three research problems being investigated: What is the typology of the SAC? What are the self-access language learning (SALL) activities and materials provided in this SAC? And how do the students perceive the self-access language learning (SALL) activities and materials? This qualitative study reveals that this SAC is categorized into supermarket typology of SAC. This is because of the SAC system offers learners the chance to look around and choose what they want to study. This system displays materials under clearly marked categories like in supermarket. This typology of SAC is suitable for all learner contexts (Gardner and Miller, 2008). However, this SAC still lack the materials and activities for SALL. Further development, in terms of materials and activities which can promote learning autonomy should be done. Most students (72%) perceive positively about certain SAC facilities, such as books, resources, strong internet connection, and cozy environment of reading and writing area. However, there should be more improvement in certain SAC facilities (such as rooms for consultation with SAC tutor, TV viewing area) and certain SAC activities (such as English club and native speaker contact).

New media has become a base structure in accelerating the development of the global community in the last two decades. Digital and virtual sides attached to the new media has brought human interaction and community level to the most complex. Social interaction is in the form of the peak of its evolution where the boundaries between the real and the virtual becomes blurred, and as if no longer relevant when distinguishing the two realms. Human habitus which was originally driven by empirical external world is now automatically changed since information technology products such as mobile phones are no longer exist merely as a communication tool but also as a means of kontrolling and diggers knowledge. This article is a kind of theoretical review of Robert Samuels theory named automodernity as a new cultural stage. He explains emancipatory ideals that originally carried the new media makes us are in a paradoxical situation for the automation of social and individual autonomy attract each effect, Automodernity is a reaction to postmodern emphasis on social and cultural conflict with individual autonomy celebrate the ability to exploit and explore irregularities (unregulated) and the social systems automatically.

While clergy take moral positions that reflect their theological commitments, we find evidence of contextualizing in how they weight moral positions."

By combining some necessary traits and characteristics of good translators coming from the field of linguistics with critical pedagogy fostered in Academic Writing course, the author will argue that translation teaching within the framework of Academic Writing class, yields creativity and more promises on the spirit of keeping humanization alive which is at the same time challenged by the ascent notion of machine translation. The growing dependence on using google translate, for most of the students observed in this case study, highlights the importance to embrace both familiarity with the logic and limitation of MT as well as rootedness within the discourse which empowers human autonomy, thus didactic translation. In this respect, the lecturer plays dual role in becoming role-model for students in translation as well as critical evaluator for their imperfect results of translating text on plagiarism seen from the linguistic phenomenon."

ICTs, for instance, are nowadays widely used in English as a foreign language (EFL) classes for being effective tools in facilitating teaching and learning. On the other hand, self-regulated learning is broadly demanded toemphasise students’ autonomy and engagement in the learning process. With regard to educational psychology, self-regulated learning (SRL) has a notable effect on students’ cognition, metacognition, motivation, and behaviours. However, in self-regulated learning, unlike self-directed learning, the teacher is primarily involved in the students’ regulation practices. This creates a challenge to the teachers concerning their abilities to support self-regulation inside the classroom walls and in a limited time, especially with the rapid evolution of technology including online platforms. The major concern of this research paper lies in the ways that support students’ self-regulation. Therefore, it ultimately discusses how online platforms, the case of ‘Easyclass’ can strengthen students’ self-regulation skills in order to improve their achievement. It also tries to assist instructors in teaching students how to be effective self-regulated learners and promote their study skills and habits through technologies."

The Community of Inquiry (CoI) has been developed as a framework for blended learning from a socio-constructivist perspective in which learning is based on educational experiences in the environment with collaboration and interaction. The purpose of this paper is to understand student experience and explore new issues in a blended learning course from the perspective of CoI. Stake’s inductive case study approach was used and data were collected by qualitative methods. The results showed that social, cognitive and teaching presences were found in the blended learning course. However, on some occasions, students experienced learning without a teaching presence but with intrinsic drive from individuals. The students directed their own learning and shared the ideas in the discourse without teaching instruction or facilitation. Learning autonomy was linked to the learning community through convenient online communication tools. This paper proposes to extend the CoI with the dimension of autonomy presence. An Extended Community of Inquiry (ECoI) framework is described and the categories and indicators of autonomy presence are expounded. The value of the paper as a contribution to literature is to enhance CoI by including the autonomy element."

Email: anton.smolkin@gmail.com   This review is dedicated to a critical analysis of the Italian philosopher’s Luigina Mortari concept of care. Mortari develops Heidegger’s ideas on caring as a fundamental component of human existence. This plot can act as a significant resource to explain the social, given the unprecedented scope of the necessary care for people as a biological species about each other, from maternal attention to the division of labour. According Mortari, care means satisfying those needs of the Other, who is unable to satisfy on their own. In other words this is a service, while real care can only be the satisfaction of vital needs. For a long time care as an independent concept was on the periphery of research interests and preference was given to the notion of autonomy, which was seen as more ideologically attractive. However, a person spends only part of their life in a state of autonomy, and during this autonomous period he or she usually acts as a source of care. Mortari criticises the liberal view of autonomy as a goal and key value rather than one stage of life. This opens the possibility to understand the unavailability of full autonomy, except at the cost of destroying the social. However, criticism of the liberal model of autonomy can have undesirable political consequences, such as becoming an excuse for paternalism and totalitarianism. Mortari sees an additional complexity in the informal nature of caring for the Other because of the fundamental unknowability of the latter. This imposes a radical responsibility on the caregiver. For example, being a good nurse does not mean acting strictly according to job descriptions; the necessary competencies are developed in practice due to the rethinking of cases. Mortari argues that care is devalued and is not rewarded adequately not only because it is mainly women engaged in it, but also because of the role played by care unmeasurability and informality. Idealising care as an endearing and giving action and in the criticism of Moss’s concept of gift, Mortari ignores the function of the gift in assembling the social."

It indicates the various national and international legislation that guarantee the citizens’ right to privacy and protection of personal data. It reviews the literature of informational ethics, associating this domain of knowledge with the concept of privacy and the context of social networks, discussing the construction of concepts that guide and are directly involved with the domains of informational ethics. Critically considers that the customization of content operated by digital companies, in exchange for the broad freedom of access to the personal data of its users, threatens the principles of autonomy and freedom in cyberspace. It notices that the investigation of personal data is also done among individuals themselves, as a reflection of the current culture of transparency.

One tool in particular, clinical pathways, has been a key component of the recent public hospital reform in China. Clinical pathways regulate how the core activities of the medical professional should be performed. Examining pathway implementation and physicians’ attitude toward them may shed light on the extent of discretion and autonomy physicians have in their core activities. Therefore, this study takes clinical pathways as a lens through which to study Chinese physicians’ work and autonomy and asks three questions: First, what is the attitude of physicians toward clinical pathways? Second, how are pathways implemented in physicians’ practice? And third, what are the determinants of physicians’ attitude? Both quantitative and qualitative data are used to explore the research questions. The quantitative data come from a survey of 158 physicians in three tertiary hospitals in two provincial capitals. The qualitative data are from all online discussions about clinical pathways on one of the most popular social networking websites for physicians and hospital administrators. The findings are consistent with the prediction based on sociological theorization of rationalization in professional work. Namely, there are two distinct dimensions in physicians’ attitude toward clinical pathways: physicians felt that pathways made their practice more scientific, but they also felt that the pathways were burdensome and restrictive. Physicians were in general heavily involved in the process of pathway implementation, and restrictive monitoring and sanctioning practices were relatively uncommon. Factors associated with pathway implementation were important predictors of physicians’ attitude, whereas professional orientation and concerns with the status of the profession had limited effect. Taken together, the findings from this exploratory study suggest that although physicians in China9s public hospitals are dependent on their organizations, they retain considerable discretion in the implementation and use of clinical pathways. On the other hand, physicians’ views of clinical pathways are more prominently shaped by organizational factors than by their professional orientation."

Dagli \nAbstract Multi-faceted systems of the future will entail complex logic and reasoning with many levels of reasoning in intricate arrangement. The organization of these systems involves a web of connections and demonstrates self-driven adaptability. They are designed for autonomy and may exhibit emergent behavior that can be visualized. They will impact manufacturing industry, defense, healthcare, energy, transportation, emergency response, agriculture and society overall. The success will come how the current challenges related to cybersecurity, interoperability, privacy, safety and socio-technical aspects mainly interaction of human behavior and complex adaptive systems are handled Complex Adaptive Systems have dynamically changing meta-architectures. Finding an optimal architecture for these systems is a multi-criteria decision making problem often involving many objectives in the order of 20 or more. This creates “Pareto Breakdown“ which prevents ordinary multi-objective optimization approaches from effectively searching for an optimal solution; saturating the decision maker with large sets of solutions that may not be representative for a compromise architecture selection from the solution space. Our quest continues to handle complexities to design and operate these systems. The challenge in Complex Adaptive Systems design is to create an organized complexity that will allow a system to achieve its goals. Researchers from academia, industry and government met in Chicago, Illinois, on October 30 to November 1, 2017, to share their findings and expand the boundaries of research in Complex Adaptive Systems. This year we are concentered on the current state of practice in Engineering Cyber Physical Systems. This publication of the Complex Adaptive Systems Proceedings series contains the edited versions of the technical presentations of Complex Adaptive Systems held October 30 to November 1, 2017, in Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A. The extended version of each selected paper was reviewed by two referees, then revised, edited and condensed to the format herein. I would like to express my gratitude to the plenary speakers at the conference for their invaluable contributions through their talks. Further, I wish to express my gratitude to all authors for their contributions to this volume of proceedings and for their presentations at the conference, as well as, to all referees for their comments and suggestions for revising the papers. I would like to mention our appreciation to the conference sponsors for bringing real life dimension, issues and engineering problems to the meeting. I would also like to thank Sue Turner and Latesha Zach for all their help and efforts that enabled me to sail smoothly in the organization of this conference and production of this volume."

Half a century after the appearance of The Social Construction of Reality, two renowned media researchers ask new questions about the ways of making and understanding the social world. Today‘s world has become profoundly mediatized, and the social gets increasingly rooted in the technological infrastructure of digital communication. The pervasive mediatization of social life transforms all of its segments on both the micro- and macro-levels. The algorithms of social media and other computer systems quantify and automate social processes which used to be perceived as qualitative. In order to understand this world, social theory has to revise its approaches and basic notions. According to Couldry and Hepp, the classical optics of Berger and Luckmann’s social constructionism is no longer suitable, developing a materialist phenomenology which emphasizes the role of media technologies in constructing the social world. Furthermore, these authors regard the social world as a complex network of figurations, using and adapting the ideas of Norbert Elias. Their work has a pronounced critical purpose: the authors are concerned about the relative autonomy of social life, which is coming under control of technological systems’ imperatives and dictated by their developers’ commercial interests. The time is approaching when the social is no longer constructed in everyday human interactions, but produced by means of various media platforms instead. Nowadays, these platforms provide us with access to the social world and constitute its space. Does this mean the end of the social construction of reality, as well as the end of social constructionism?"

Davis \nA growing number of patients make up their minds about some medical issue before they see their provider, either by googling their symptoms or asking a friend. They’ve made up their minds before coming in, and they resist their provider’s recommendations even after receiving information and advice from their provider. This is a new kind of medical autonomy problem; it differs from cases of standard consent, futility, or conscientious refusal. Providers sometimes call this problem “Dr. Google.” I call it premature consent. Providers may wonder whether these patient decisions command the same deference and respect as other patient decisions. The answer is “no,” for these patients are neither fully competent nor properly informed. They typically appear to be competent, but competence includes the ability to deliberate, and they are not deliberating well when they make up their minds before consulting a qualified provider. They seem informed, especially after talking to their provider, but they are misinformed about what sources of medical advice to trust. Moreover, being informed requires believing the information one has received, and these patients sometimes don’t believe the information their provider gives them."

However, despite the tremendous growth of social media applications in the health-care industry, trust is still among the biggest challenges for social media health services in gaining greater acceptance. Drawn from previous literature on self-determination theory, social support, and trust, this study investigates people’s intentions to seek health-information on social media. The authors carefully selected a sample from Italy with subjects who already had experience in seeking health information on social media. The empirical results show that informational support, emotional support, and the satisfaction of people’s autonomy and relatedness needs play an important role through trust in influencing people’s health-information-seeking intentions on social media. This study is among the first to adopt the theories of self-determination, social support, and trust to investigate people’s intentions to seek health information on social media."

Doctors are expected to deliver quality medical service at the hospitals. However, hospitals often find it difficult to exercise efective managerial control over the quality of medical services. This study aimed to investigate the effect of doctor’s personality, job characteristic, payment method, facility, on performance and quality of doctor service. Subjects and Method: This was an analytic observational study using cross-sectional design. The study was carried out at Dr. Moewardi  Hospital and PKU Muhammadiyah Hospital, Surakarta, from March to May 2017. A sample 182 study subjects consisting of 26 doctors, 26 nurses, and 130 patients, were selected for this study by simple random sampling. The dependent variable was quality of doctor service. The independent variables were doctor’s personality (extrovert vs. introvert), doctor’s carefulness, proactive attitude, self-efficacy, autonomy, performance feedback, supervisor support, payment method, work site (private vs. public), and performance. Questionnaire was used to collect data. Path analysis was employed to analyze the data. Results : Good quality of doctor service was directly affected by good performance (b=0.64, SE=0.11, p<0.001), private work site (b= 2.85, SE=0.66, p<0.001), and strong self-efficacy (b=0.21, SE=0.07, p=0.006). Good work performance  was affected by extrovert personality (b=0.08, SE= 0.06, p=0.186), careful attitude (b=0.30; SE=0.09; p=0.001), proactive personality (b=−0.17; SE=0.05; p=0.001), strong self-efficacy (b=0.27; SE=0.07; p<0.001), autonomy (b=0.16; SE=0.06; p=0.015), performance feedback (b=0.43; SE=0.13, p<0.001), supervisor support  (b=0.14, SE=0.06, p=0.018), payment method (INA CBGs) (b= −2.29; SE= 0.66; p<0.001), and private work site (b= -0.26, SE= 0.68, p=0.696). Conclusion: Good quality of doctor service is directly affected by good performance, private work site, and strong self-efficacy.

Adolescence is a time of increased autonomy during which parents may be uncertain about their abilities to influence their adolescents’ risk-taking behavior. Design. Parents’ (N = 145 mothers and 53 fathers) confidence in their parenting abilities across prudential adolescent behaviors was investigated, including alcohol consumption, cyber activities, eating behaviors, and problem peer associations. Additionally, we explored how adolescents’ (N = 161, Mage = 14.4 years, 60% female) reports of their engagement in those behaviors were associated with parents’ perceptions of their ability to impact their adolescents’ behavior (i.e., self-efficacy). Results. Mixed-model analysis of variance revealed that mothers and fathers felt most efficacious in reducing their adolescents’ engagement in problematic cyber activities and least efficacious regarding alc…"

While with ECS the idea of full end-to-end interoperability is one of the key features, initial research (28 qualitative interviews) conducted by us indicate that consumers use different MMAs to negotiate their social ties. In this paper, we extend this research with an analysis of the functionalities of 139 MMAs and 20 in-depth interviews focusing on how consumers use individual services to manage stages of intimacy in relationships, communicate a message’s urgency, or craft social messages. We find that the technological seams between various MMAs indeed fulfil important functions as they enable consumers to mediate competence, relatedness and autonomy as defined in Deci and Ryan’s Self-Determination Theory (SDT). Furthermore, the paper shows how the choice of MMA reflects different stages of relationship development. Finally, we show that consumers also rely on technological seams between MMAs to feel autonomous and competent in their social interactions as the choice of MMA and functionality according to the specificities of the situation adheres to a finely grained social code. For policy makers and regulators, our results indicate that imposing interoperability obligations on MMAs is likely to reduce consumers’ well-being given the importance of technological seams to enact self-determination."

In such work environments, normally individuals are provided with autonomy and independence in performing tasks, thus allowing them to further engage in their given work. This study investigated task antecedents of work engagement, and further explored the process of how task characteristics affect work engagement. It focused on examining the mediating effect of role ambiguity on the task characteristics-work engagement relationship and the moderating effect of information and communication technology (ICT) presenteeism on the task characteristics–role ambiguity relationship through multiple regression analyses and a bootstrapping procedure on survey data collected from 202 South Korean employees. It found that task interdependence and autonomy were negatively associated with role ambiguity. Of the two task characteristics, only task interdependence had a negative relationship with role ambiguity, and this relationship was significantly moderated by ICT presenteeism such that the negative association between task interdependence and role ambiguity was more pronounced when ICT presenteeism was high than when it was low."

If its invention allowed the dissociation between sexual practice and motherhood, the drug is currently considered harmful in some contexts. From the theoretical perspective of genealogy, we analyze which inventions of the feminine are possible base on the discourses on the pill today. As methodology, we used the analysis of the discourse of reports of Veja magazine and of posts from non-hormonal contraception groups on the social network site Facebook. The results show that, in the reports, the drug appears as the motor of emancipation of the woman; while in the groups new activisms raise the flag of body without pill as a political action for the conquest of freedom. We conclude that, in the regime of contemporary knowledge-power, the rescue of the natural female body reconfigures itself as a device of freedom against the control of medicalization."

In Sweden, 75% of the Thai population are women, among whom 80% are partnered with Swedish or other Scandinavian men. Previous studies have indicated that lack of autonomy, social isolation, and stigma are important risk factors for poor mental health for foreign-born women as well as for women in international marriages.To explore what characterizes the processes, choices, challenges and relational conditions that Thai women, partnered with Swedish or Danish men, experience during their first years in Sweden.A qualitative study using a Constructivist Grounded Theory approach based on fourteen individual interviews with Thai women partnered with Swedish or Danish men and residing in Sweden.The core category ‘possibilities to maintain a strong self in Sweden’ is linked to five categories characterizing the process that the women go through over time. The subcategories illustrate different paths taken even if there were possibilities to change paths along the way. The women had, for different reasons, reached a turning point that made them leave Thailand. In Sweden, they started in dependency and struggled in different ways to adjust to relational norms and handle prejudice. Toward the end of the timeline, differing ways of recognizing life choices depended on access to social networks and partners’ attitudes.Our study showed the crucial role of economical, emotional and social support from partners and networks for Thai women’s possibilities to maintain a strong self and good health after migration. This implies a need for supporting Thai women to be more independent by providing access to language education, employment and community involvement. The current requirement for becoming a permanent resident should also be reviewed not to jeopardize women international marriages possibilities’ to leave unhealthy relationships."

This can be achieved through planned activities and the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs), resources designed to complement students’ autonomous learning needs. A quantitative analysis of students’ academic performance using final course grades was performed for a fundamentals of electronics course and we examine students’ perception of their autonomy using surveys. The students’ progress and attitudes were monitored over four consecutive semesters. The first began with the design of the intervention and the following three consisted in the implementation. The strategy was focused on the development of course competencies through autonomous learning with ICT tools presented in the VLE. Findings indicate that the students who did the activities in the VLE showed an increase in performance scores in comparison with students who did not do them. The strategy used in this study, which enhanced perceived autonomy, was associated with a positive effect on their learning process. This research shows that a technology-enhanced course supported by ICT activities can both improve academic performance and foster autonomy in students."

Freedom can be defined as the preservation of the right of autonomy in the daily life of citizens or members of social and political organisations, whilst respecting the utilisation of this right, by oneself, or by one or more persons or citizens. A number of strengths and weaknesses are identified in this regard. The paper examines the way in which search engines like Google exemplify restrictions on freedom: they are enhanced by the use of technical resources that are aimed at the most efficient exploitation of the information available on the Internet; the resources are not utilised to reinforce the rights of the users. Finally, it is argued that the limits imposed on freedom can be overcome with the aid of technical tools such as thesauri that can produce a positive relationship between freedom and Internet.

    "text": "Doc 879 :  The Functionalities of Success – A Psychological Exploration of Mobile Messenger Apps’ Success \nhttps://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2941792\n René Arnold \n Anna Schneider \nMobile Messenger Apps (MMAs) such as WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, LINE, Signal or Snapchat enjoy impressive success worldwide. Since many of these applications are offered at no monetary cost, telecommunications providers have argued that consumers choose MMAs predominantly to save money. In light of consumers’ complementary and multi-homing use of MMAs, it seems unlikely that saving money can fully explain their success. Our paper draws on more than 60 semi-structured qualitative interviews with consumers to explore why they opt for MMAs, why they use them complementary to Electronic Communications Services (ECS) and why they use multiple MMAs at a time. Specifically, our paper follows a grounded theory approach. It uses three rounds of interviews. The first round (20 interviews) established an initial understanding of relevant success factors of MMAs from a consumer perspective. The second round (24 interviews) focused on the role of technological seams enabling consumer to negotiate their social sphere. The third round of interviews (20 interviews) emphasized how functions not available with ECS may fulfill or thwart basic psychological needs (competence, relatedness and autonomy) as established in Self-Determination Theory (SDT). Throughout the three rounds of interviews, it emerges that indeed saving costs is not a central motive for consumer to use MMAs. Additional functions such as (1) rich interaction using video chat, pictures, videos, etc.; (2) group chats; (3) awareness and notification functions; (4) voice messages; and (5) presentation of self e.g. via a profile picture provide better fulfillment of one’s basic psychological needs than ECS without these functions. Furthermore, our results show that both complementary use of ECS and MMAs as well as MMA multi-homing can be explained by consumers enacting competence in applying and decoding subtle social codes along the stages of stage models of relationship development. In sum, our results highlight the relevance of additional and innovative functionalities of MMAs for their success. These functionalities generally help to fulfill consumers’ basic psychological needs better than SMS. Furthermore, consumers’ need fulfillment is supported by the opportunity to use various MMAs in parallel to adhere to a finely grained set of social codes associated with interpersonal communication. Hence policy and regulators should not interfere with the innovation paths of these applications as well as the technological seams that exist between them. For marketers, our results add further insights as regards potential targeting strategies for developing platform business models for MMAs."

The cyberbullying is closely connected to the processes of children’s identity construction, of the relation to the peer group and of the definition of autonomy trough which they can free themselves from the control of adults. It is an issue that can be read even from a gender perspective because if the victims are mostly girls, the peculiar procedures enable girls to behave as bullies. Furthermore many of the cyberbullying acts have to do with the body representation and the models of masculinity and femininity that define the imaginary of teenagers. The aim is going beyond the focus on the digital tools and their possible emotional damage for looking at the contents that reproduce sexism and oppression which is not often recognized as problematic."

Krishen \n Shaurya Agarwal \n Pushkin Kachroo \nAbstract Social media environments can transform and reinforce life experiences, influencing self-concept and providing happiness. The goal of this research is to examine social media networking as an experiential phenomenon, wherein consumers pursue virtual happiness by satisfying the self-determination theory (SDT) needs of relatedness, competence, and autonomy. Beginning with the memory connection to self-concept, the study proposes an experiential outcome circle for social media to virtual happiness. A circle depicts the idea that self-concept motivates social media behavior, which influences the self-concept. Happiness, or affect balance, is a potential outcome of this connection. The study analyzes n = 504 social media networking participants using generational cohorts with fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). This study suggests the metaphors for each generation based on the following SDT recipes: (1) “we” for generation Y with relatedness and competence, (2) “me” for generation X, with autonomy and competence, and (3) “be” for baby boomers with competence."

The findings demonstrate many of the benefits of e-portfolio practice regarding learners’ increased sense of ownership, teacher and peer feedback, enriched learning experience at both individual and technological levels, enhanced opportunity for self-improvement and increased awareness of the learning process. Despite many positive aspects of e-portfolios use, the study reveals some challenges facing students, teachers and support staff, mainly connected with technical problems and Internet access, and the necessity for teachers and learners to change their roles to become more independent in the learning process. The author concludes that e-portfolio is a promising tool to stimulate and challenge students to become independent and self-regulated learners that should be implemented in English language learning at higher educational institutions."

It is all the more necessary therefore, that the leading persons in these fields should declare themselves as strenuously and decisively opposed to such tampering with human autonomy. Shils expresses many of the anxieties and conundrums we’ve heard this week about massive human studies on networked platforms."

The approach carried out in the pages of this paper showed that the local autonomy, understood as democracy at local level, on the one hand, and the financial, human, material and information resources, on the other hand, are of paramount importance for the good functioning of the local administrative mechanism. Without these resources the autonomy can not fully manifest, the local public administrative authorities being unable to fulfill their responsibilities, situation that endangers the functioning of local administrative system as a whole and that, finally, generates the inefficiency of the administration process from administrative-territorial units. /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:Table Normal; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-parent:; mso-padding-alt:0cm 5.4pt 0cm 5.4pt; mso-para-margin:0cm; mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:10.0pt; font-family:Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language:#0400; mso-fareast-language:#0400; mso-bidi-language:#0400;}"

The digital folder (e-portofolio) constitutes an educational breakthrough which fulfils the criterion of polymorphism. Our goal, in this study is the research concerning the contribution of the e-portofolio in the promotion of the cooperative freedom during flexible zone to second grade primary school students. As a basic research tool we created an e-portofolio utilising the Mahara software. In this research, 12 second grade students from an urban area of Athens took part. The introduction of the e-portofolio was created in two phases during the school year 2014-2015. Initially, the pilot application in the program ‘all the earth, an embrace’ and the main one was realised with the program ‘the water’. Through the methodological approach of the qualitative action research we concluded that cooperation and autonomy can be achieved within the context of the educational community in a distance learning environment with the use of guided educational dialogue."

This proposal, named AssisT-Task, is a full functional mobile application for Android smartphones and offers step-by-step guidance, establishing a learning method through task sequencing. It has been tested with a group of 10 users and 2 types of labour tasks. Through 7 recorded sessions, we compared the performance and the learning progress with the tool against the traditional assisting method, based on paper instructions. The results show that people with cognitive disabilities learnt and performed better and faster when using AssisT-Task than the traditional method, particularly on tasks that require cognitive effort rather than manual skills. This learning has proved to be essential to obtain an adequate degree of personal autonomy for people with cognitive impairment."

Recent developments in information technology are accelerating the pace of change in products, particularly the emergence of smart products. Despite these technological advances, however, there is a lack of understanding about consumers who buy and use smart products. In this empirical study, five smartness dimensions of autonomy, adaptability, reactivity, multifunctionality, and ability to cooperate, are used to examine perceived product smartness which is also tested with consumer satisfaction. Based on their experiences with smartphones, 388 consumers, in their 20s, respond to the questionnaire. Among the five factors, adaptability y and multi-functionality have significant influence on perceived product smartness and consumer satisfaction. However, the other three factors do not show a significant impact. In addition, the moderator effect of customer innovativeness on satisfaction has been proven significant. The results of this study provide a better understanding of the impact of product smartness on customer attitudes and provide managerial implications for new product development and market managemet."

While recent transformations in the city have benefited some more than others, developments in the city are allowing for the creation of new ‘spatial texts’ in a place notorious for constraining women. In this article, I explore feminist geographer Linda McDowell’s idea that the city is a place in which the active, independent woman comes into her own. Drawing on focus groups, emails and photos sent to me by educated, ‘middle class’ Papua New Guinean women living in Port Moresby, I demonstrate that the city’s new places are paradoxical, even liberating places. The article reveals both the extent of women’s subordination in the city and the emerging possibilities for middle class women to experience a degree of autonomy. Nevertheless as Radice notes, women must endlessly renegotiate their experience of comfort in relation to others, including those whose lives are less comfortable."

So \n Louis Leung \n Francis L. F. Lee \n Michael W.Y. Chan \nThe present study examines the struggle for hegemony in the public sphere by two different systems, following Hong Kong’s handover to China in 1997. It has been postulated that the new media, particularly social media, has become an important public sphere for the citizens of Hong Kong to engage in an anti-hegemonic struggle against China’s discursive encroachment into Hong Kong since 1997. Given that the public platform provided by legacy media has been bought out or coopted by China, new media has begun to serve as a subaltern public sphere to enable resisting the hegemony imposed by China. This was analyzed through a survey conducted as part of this study, which showed that people who are young, read the Apple Daily, have high expectations of local autonomy, and a high regard for press freedom are prone to using social media to obtain their social and political information. This article analyzes the implications of the emergence of a counter-China hegemonic public sphere."

Communication and informational technologies like laptops, tablets, and smartphones enable workers to stay connected regardless of physical location and time of day (Kossek, 2016). Managing the boundaries between the work and home domain is not a new issue (Nippert-Eng, 2008), yet the increasing technological embeddedness in our everyday lives increases the complexity and relevance of these boundaries for both organizations and employees. Communication technology can in many cases give opportunities for more flexibility, autonomy, and control. Nevertheless, it might also exert a pressure on employees, breeding an “always available” culture in organizations (Kossek, 2016). Leaders and managers set examples through their own behavior, which signal what is expected from the employees. Leaders who reply to and send emails during odd hours might contribute to the establishment of organizational norms that revolve around being available after hour and during off days.  However, whether or not this becomes a problem is dependent on individual differences, perceived control over boundaries and companies’ availability policy. This review will take a closer look at the different factors that influence the management of work-life boundaries and how technology influences this relationship."

In this study, we investigate the day-level effects of work-related smartphone use during non-work time on employees’ psychological well-being. Drawing on the Limited Strength Model of Self-Control, we propose that work-related smartphone use depletes limited regulatory resources and thus, impairs well-being at the day-level. Furthermore, based on arguments brought up by Self-Determination Theory, we propose basic need satisfaction at work as a buffering moderator of this relationship, arguing that for employees with high levels of basic need satisfaction work-related smartphone use is less depleting due to high intrinsic motivation and higher levels of energy, which support resource recovery. A diary study covering ten working days (N = 74) was conducted to test our hypotheses. Results indicate that, in line with our expectations, work-related smartphone use impairs employees’ psychological well-being at the day-level. The satisfaction of basic psychological needs at work (autonomy, competence and relatedness) can buffer these effects and thus, protect employees from impairments of well-being. Practical relevance: Technological innovations such as smartphones allow employees to work anywhere, at any time, thus blurring the lines between different life domains and endangering employees’ well-being. Our study suggests different practical interventions to prevent such impairments of well-being for both organizations and individuals."

    "text": "Doc 894 :  Teaching Sex Education with Poetry: An Intimate Coupling \n\n Amber Moore \nEnglish are multifaceted and polymathic. Alongside our students, we explore cultures, perspectives, and lived experiences through text, often encouraging intellectual development and affective maturation (Williams, 2012, p. xi). Thus, through such diverse learning, sometimes-complicated discussions arise, and texts that touch on sexualities surface our classrooms. Pickering (2004), who inspired the film Dead Poets Society (1989), argues that teachers never escape sexual doings (p. 237); if it true that (in general) can’t escape sex, how might English (in particular) purposefully integrate it their curriculum? Johnson (2015), citing Lewis and Tierney’s (2011) work, posits in the English classroom, where personal growth often an explicit part of the curriculum . . . , sex might seem a natural fit (p. 61). Therefore, English would do well to develop effective teaching strategies for addressing issues related to sex education including sexualities, healthy relationships, consent, and so forth. Further, finding dynamic ways for educators to exercise reflexivity their teaching practice also important when trying new approaches to learning.I have been fortunate to teach English a progressive public secondary school western Canada where the have a great deal of autonomy to develop curriculum that attends to students’ collective needs and interests. As Brezicha, Bergmark, and Mitra (2014) argue, Effectively leading a complex and dynamic system requires leaders who [understand and respect] how individuals make sense of their work while working within the context of their social environment and boundaries of the school setting (p. 124). We have such leadership at the helm of our school, which I realize makes my context a bit of an educational nirvana. Nonetheless, I hope my experiences might have some applicability for the readers of English Education.As evidence of our school’s commitment to best practices, my administration approached me as the English department leader to organize our five literacy to embed a healthy relationships curriculum, comprised of sex and consent education material, into grade 9 English. As Jones (2011) describes, this curriculum is seen as a hyponym under which sub-types such as sex education (education mainly concerned with the act of intercourse or reproduction), relationship education (education mainly concerned with the creation of romantic or sexual relationships) and other types fall (p. 371). This opportunity emerged from challenges with scheduling the ninthgrade class timetable, which runs differently than other grades. In an effort to provide new options, physical education classes faced losing critical time the gymnasium unless another department took on teaching the health curriculum component, which how our English team got this exciting chance to explore sex education with a fresh approach.Fortunately, each teacher had previously taught sex education some capacity, including roles such as a physical education teacher, a social worker, a volunteer sexual assault counselor, or teacher of a locally developed career and life management course that included a healthy relationships curriculum. As such, we had complete freedom with bringing this learning our classrooms; we could simply take a break from our literacy studies to complete the curriculum, or we could integrate with a text or film study- whatever would work best.Each teacher uniquely approached the subject matter, embracing the opportunity to try something new. As we taught it differently, we also supported one another by sharing our ideas and observations, swapping lesson plans, and emailing links to resources. This a common practice our department, as the majority of us contend, meaningful collaboration benefits educators and students alike (Ketterlin-Geller, Baumer, & Lichon, 2015, p. …"

This expansion has encouraged a new role for librarians to assume, in that a subset of health sciences librarians identify as “satellite librarians” who are permanently located at a distance from the main campus. Due to the unique nature of this role and lack of existing data on the topic, the authors investigated the experiences and perceptions of this unique group of information professionals. Methods: An electronic survey was distributed to health sciences librarians via two prominent North American email discussion lists. Questions addressed the librarians’ demographics, feelings of social inclusion, technological support, autonomy, professional support, and more. Results: Eighteen surveys were analyzed. While several respondents stated that they had positive working relationships with colleagues, many cited issues with technology, scheduling, and lack of consideration as barriers to feeling socially included at both the parent and local campuses. Social inclusion, policy creation, and collection management issues were subject to their unique situations and their colleagues’ perceptions of their roles as satellite librarians. Conclusions: The results from this survey suggest that the role of the academic health sciences librarian at the satellite campus needs to be clearly communicated and defined. This, in turn, will enhance the experience for the librarian and provide better service to the client."

Thus, firms are establishing online platforms to support users in innovating services, such as iOS and Android platforms for mobile data service (MDS) innovation. Mobile phone platforms are characterized by technology (toolkits) and policy (rules) components that could influence user’s innovation. Additionally, attributes of user innovators (lead userness) are expected to drive their innovation behavior. Yet it is unclear how these characteristics jointly impact users’ service innovation outcomes. To address this knowledge gap, we propose a model that builds on user innovation theory and the work design literature to explain the influences of lead userness, design autonomy, toolkit support, and their interactions on user’s innovation outcomes (innovation quantity) on these platforms. We conceptualize toolkit support in terms of two constructs (i.e., ease of effort and exploration), and design autonomy in terms of three constructs (i.e., decision-making autonomy, scheduling autonomy, and work-method autonomy). The model was tested using survey and archival data from two dominant mobile phone platforms (i.e., iOS and Android). As hypothesized, lead userness, exploration through toolkits, and ease of effort through toolkits positively affect users’ innovation quantity. Additionally, decision-making autonomy and work-method autonomy influence innovation quantity, but scheduling autonomy does not. Further, the proposed three-way interactions between lead userness, toolkit support, and design autonomy constructs on users’ quantity of MDS innovation are largely supported. The findings enhance our understanding of user innovation on mobile phone platforms."

This however hides the fact that there is a great variety of different participative practices, both on micro and macro levels, practiced for very different purposes. Sometimes speaking of participation is just juggling with names. In many enterprises market driven work organisations offer “participation” to employees, which is in fact a device to misuse employees’ interest in “authentic participation” (Fals Borda, 2013/2007) for increasing the efficiency of work by dependent autonomy. In modern forms of so called interactive value creation via the internet we find another practice: so called participation of consumers or online communities of co-producers in designing, creating or improving (new) products. Even in trade unions the use and practice of participation is sometimes ambivalent. In order to distinguish authentic participation in the interest of participants from the misuse of participation for different interests (increase in efficiency; exploitation of participants’ creative capacities) this author coins the term of democratic participation, characterised by, among others, democratic dialogue between subjects (no othering business); collective reflection; giving a voice to all participants. Finally it is argued that the practice of democratic participation may open horizons of utopia. Keywords: authentic participation, democratic participation, participation on micro and macro levels, trade unions’ participative practices, inflationary use of the term participation"

It also presents and compares the three analytical dimensions and uses them to characterize, in an exploratory manner, three cases of social mobilization (the Arab Spring in Egypt, the 15M, and the Platform for People Affected by Mortgages in Spain). In the text, the use of social net- works and the media is a transverse study based on the three dimensions proposed. e analysis shows that some forms of protest have declined to the feelings of political frustration of citizens, and they have been displaced to a second institutional level or suffered a systematic disarticulation. We propose the conceptualization of the contemporary social movement as a collective space built on a strategy aimed at a specific political system that performs change actions focused on autonomy processes and sets out long-term objectives that have been agreed upon."

Romaniuk \nScience – research transformation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has a number of colours and shadows, many dimensions including technical, social, community, financial, economic and civilization. This transformation has many wide development roads but also numerable pitfalls and traps. It does not take place solely at the level of scientific and technical progress and innovation. It preliminarily takes place in a complex socio-political-economic context, narrowed for simplification as social acceptance and education only. Such acceptance, for example expressed simply by demand and market popularity, for simple items supplemented by useful functions, such as an iron that recognizes the type of fabric and matches its work accordingly, a completely autonomous vacuum cleaner, etc., is trivial. We aim at much deeper relations of IoT with society. If IoT were only adding such functionalities, it would not be worth the time to consider it here. IoT causes a lot of confusion for much more important reasons in many areas of life. Somewhere further on the potential paths of IoT development, it has been noted with interest, but also with anxiety, the possibility of its empowerment as local but also global, superintendent surveillance system, gathering enormous amounts of information, creating knowledge and making autonomous decisions. Potential subjectivity must include such attributes as acquiting from the creator, autonomy, consciousness, morality and further building by the society the whole legal system around the new entity. It will not be a single entity, it will be a whole virtual society, with electronic people. The consequences can be far-reaching and appear as an inevitable option on such a scale for the first time in the history of our human society. Overcoming certain barriers recognized by us may mean that the intelligence and consciousness are not only attributes of the human biological mind. Such reasoning, not without a reason, encounters strong resistance. However, there is a fundamental difference between the opposition to some genetic research and the potential modification of man himself, and the opposition to machine building, a system of superintendence that far exceeds the possibilities of a single man and of entire societies."

Such conceptions provide a way for these artists to respond to colonial appropriation, reactivate interrupted dialogues, engender new forms of territorialization, and create places of commemoration and memory preservation. Similar to the historiographical deconstruction performed by thinkers and activists such as Vine Deloria Jr. and Taiaiake Alfred, these artists’ works offer a model of autonomy and environmental balance. While some are reviving mnemonic practices, such as the making of wampum, which traditionally preserve memories of alliances and conflicts, others have embraced Internet and selfie technologies as a means of creating new spaces for speech and recognition."

Since the enactment of Bioethics and Safety Act in 2004, the Republic of Korea has developed a regulatory framework that reflects ethical principles. However, the existing regulation of biobanks has recently proven to be limited in responding to newer ethical and legal issues that have arisen. First, as there is an emerging trend for human biospecimens to be stored, managed and distributed as digitalized data, the current role of the Distributive Review Committee may become less important compared to the Data Access Committee. Second, even if public health data is anonymized, the risk of identifiability is growing. This makes a third point relevant, informed consent is crucial to respect the autonomy of patients and research subjects, but current consent rules need to change to reflect the interactive and dynamic communication process, in which information and communication technology (ICT) plays an increasingly prominent role. Fourth, even though data sharing for research is expected to be altruistic and the sale of human biospecimens and genome data remains prohibited, data sharing practices have become more complicated and are closer to commercial use and commercialization. Given these challenges, there is a pressing need for continuing and deeper deliberation in order to develop a more comprehensive and responsive governance framework."

Una reflexión sobre el hacer archivo en redes sociales a partir del contexto argentino actual \nhttps://doi.org/10.22395/angr.v16n31a4\n Diego Germán Vigna \nFor a decade and a half, the ways of filing and authorial intervention in web formats have invaded different spheres of action of the subjects, and have fostered behaviors of identity and cultural construction. Ways of registration and documentary organization that until recently seemed restricted to the study of institutional files, writers’ files or other ways of preservation of cultural heritage, today model the daily practices of subjects that are involved with relational processes mediated by technologies. Within the framework of this problem, our objective is to reflect on the ways of making files in the context of virtual social networks, which we consider central to understanding the dynamics of intervention of subjects and groups in the interactive digital environment. This reflection is based on a documentary analysis of the publications and user interventions in the most used social network in Argentina, Facebook, taking as empirical reference the last presidential campaign of 2015. The analysis is structured by considering each publication or post as a unit of content, following the principle of digital modularity. We took the 2015 presidential campaign in Argentina because, in its development, the interactive component was a key based on a premise of fundamental action arising from the analysis, which we call the imperative of the saying. This notion, within the framework of a specific publication and filing grammar, is central in order to understand strategies for capturing votes conceived from the supposed autonomy of users."

Structural equation modeling techniques were used to investigate the theoretical relationships among the constructs. Constant comparative method was employed to analyze qualitative data that resulted from the transcription of semi-structured interviews with 12 field experts. Findings Quantitative results showed that individualism has a significant effect on Internet addition through affiliation, dominance, achievement, and autonomy (i.e., psychological needs). As students’ needs for dominance, achievement, and autonomy increased their Internet addiction levels decreased. However, increase in the need of affiliation led to…"

They were administered Internet addiction scale (Young, 1998) and Psychological wellbeing scale (Ryff, 1989). One way ANOVA was employed to find out the difference between normal, problematic and addict levels of internet on psychological wellbeing scores. Results revealed that as the levels of internet addiction increased, total psychological wellbeing scores decreased linearly and significantly. As the levels of internet addiction increased, wellbeing also decreased in specific components of autonomy, environmental mastery, and purpose in life."

It is believed, however, that Asian learners seem to possess reactive autonomy so that while they can organize their resources autonomously to achieve their learning goals, they are unable to take responsibility for their own learning. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to explore the factors that influence Vietnamese EFL learners’ support for or resistance to promoting learner autonomy within a 15-week, portfolio-based writing course. The data were collected using semi-structured interviews and writing logs in this qualitative research and analyzed through content analysis. The findings showed three major factors (personal, academic, and external) supporting and resisting developing learner autonomy in the portfolio-based writing course."

This study took the course “Marketing Management” as an example. It analyzed the challenges and opportunities for this course in the era of Internet. Based on the analysis, the study gave several suggestions about the course content, teaching modes and methods, and assessment forms. It puts forward that marketing course must follow the trend of Internet, expand the content, innovate the teaching mode, use the diversified teaching methods, and adopt the dynamic teaching evaluation mechanisms. Then the enthusiasm and autonomy of the students could be increased, and the teaching quality could be improved."

Expenditure growth on average is about 2.5% a year (OECD, 2015) most notably led by the impact of ageing population. One of the areas with the fastest growth due to the “ageing-boom” is that the senior care. Technology investment is necessary to cope with the surge of patients. Internet of Things is one of those solutions. Too few studies have analyzed the organizational impact of these technologies. We propose a model confounding organizational perspective and anthropology. We seek to understand how the diversity of technological tools can give meaning to their implementation in the organization. Based on experts’ statements and analysing weak signals, we suggest three trends: the Internet of Things strengthens patients’ autonomy; it fights against the negative image of Senior care and ensures continuity between homecare services and institutionalization. The Internet of Things strengthens the bureaucratic aspect of Senior care, which in certain respects sound like highly bureaucratic organization where control becomes dominant. The duty of monitoring, control and transparency is enhanced by disempowering professionals and changing the tasks of Senior care directors whose supervisory task has grown major. The Internet of Things can strengthen an opposite organizational model based on technical and human networks."

The question is not if further innovation and automation will happen but when—sooner than later—and how. Independent of physical production innovations (additive manufacturing) the information integration and decision autonomy tendencies themselves will drive new supply chain and customer interaction designs and business models. This article presents a technology forecast model based on extensive descriptions of developments by field as well as interaction traits. Results suggest that the crucial element in AI and technology application in logistics will be the human factor and human-artificial cooperation capacities and attitudes."

The emphasis is made on a number of new tasks related to the education content update. Implementation of the function of deliberate development management lies in a combination of traditional education with modern electronic technologies. Therefore, in order to achieve the training objectives (the expected application of acquired competencies) and improve the quality of education, a student must master existing forms of self-education. The practicability of using electronic means in educational activities has been proved as most students are active Internet and programs users that help to interest them, concentrate students’ attention on studying new material, motivate their active cognitive activity. Since it is a priority task of modern higher education establishments to create pedagogical conditions for the identification and development of students’ abilities, satisfaction of their needs and interests, formation of competences, development of educational and cognitive activity and creative autonomy, purposeful regulation of independence development is carried out in the process of educational interaction by helping to form creative student activity experience. The pedagogical aspect of students’ motivation for independent cognitive activity has also been analyzed in the article by the author. It has been proved that the formation of educational motives is directly proportional to the success and further individual development as a future specialist."

This study aimed to examine the effects of ICT-based learning using wiki on learning of students’ vocabulary mastery at the junior high school. The design of the present study was quasi-experimental study. The population of the study was seventh graders of a junior high school in Bandung. Experimental group and control group comprised of 25 students each. The instruments of the study were a pre-test and a post-test of vocabulary mastery and an online learning platform called wiki. The data were analyzed by SPSS 16.0 for the windows. The findings revealed that there were significant differences at .05 level between experimental group and control group (df= 49, t= 2.02). Furthermore, recommendations are proposed for the teachers whose teaching philosophy is twisted with ICT-based learning. For instance, they should provide an interesting topic on the wiki, let them chat while working online, assign them working at home and well prepare the facilities used in the class before starting of the lesson."

Using unique data on the work times of Internet-based freelancers, specifically, self-employed professionals participating in a Russian-language online labor market (N = 4,280), the authors find that working at night has adverse effects on workers’ subjective well-being as measured by satisfaction with work–life balance, life satisfaction, and emotional exhaustion. Night work has differential effects on freelancers’ well-being based on gender, partnership status, and caregiving responsibilities. Highlighting the autonomy paradox, the authors’ findings document how freelancers’ discretionary application of a flexible schedule to work at night consequently undermines their well-being."

We examined this question by using interviews, the experience sampling method, and mobile logging of 86,402 sessions of app use. One motivation for use (habitual use to pass the time) and two types of use (entertainment and passive social media) were associated with a lower sense of meaningfulness. In interviews, participants reported feeling a loss of autonomy when using their phone in these ways. These reports were corroborated by experience sampling data showing that motivation to achieve a specific purpose declined over the course of app use, particularly for passive social media and entertainment usage. In interviews, participants pointed out that even when smartphone use itself was meaningless, it could sometimes still be meaningful in the context of broader life as a ‘micro escape’ from negative situations. We discuss implications for how mobile apps can be used and designed to reduce meaningless experiences."

From a theoretical point of view, the impact of ICT on workplace organization is ambigu- ous. On the one hand, the fast diffusion of ICT among employees makes it possible to monitor professional activities, leading to greater centralization. On the other hand, ICT enable employees to work more autonomously, so that workplace organization becomes more decentralized. Based on ordinary least squares and instrumental variable estimates, we find that ICT promotes both centralization and decentralization tendencies. Furthermore, managerial employees are more affected by ICT-induced monitoring and autonomy than their non-managerial counterparts. Finally, the effect of digital ICT on employee autonomy is more pronounced than the corresponding effect on employee monitoring. Again, this does especially hold for managerial employees. All in all, our results support the view that unlike prior technological revolutions digitalization primarily affects the employment prospects and working conditions of employees at medium and higher hierarchical levels."

Study period was from July 2016 to June 2017.Sample size was 289 postgraduate clinical students of various course (MD, FCPS & Diploma) and 20 clinical teachers of 10 selected postgraduate medical institutes of Bangladesh. Convenience sampling technique was adopted. Data collection was done with self- administered semi-structured questionnaire using Postgraduate Hospital Educational Environment Measurement (PHEEM) inventory and by In-depth interview of teachers. Three subscales of PHEEM are students’ perceptions about ‘role autonomy’, students’ perceptions about quality of teaching and students’ perceptions about social support. In-depth interview of the clinical teachers was undertaken to explore the training facilities in the selected postgraduate medical institutes of Bangladesh. Study result revealed total PHEEM score was110.08.Mean score of subscales of PHEEM were 34.51, 36.29 and 26.28 for ‘role autonomy’, quality of teaching and social support respectively. All these values indicates that the students’ perception were in the right or positive direction. Analysis of individual items had shown mean score of most of the individual item were 2-3 that indicated the aspects of the climate that could be enhanced. There were few items that had mean score 2 or less than 2 that indicated the problematic areas of hospital educational environment. In-depth interview of the teachers revealed that there was also some problematic issues on postgraduate training facilities like work overload, lack of proper monitoring or supervision of training, inadequate library, internet, ICU and investigation facilities etc. Study recommended that significant attention should be paid in the problematic areas (lack of supervised training, heavy work load of student, lack of library facility etc.) as well as improvement needed on several areas of hospital educational environment of postgraduate medical institutes of Bangladesh.

It opens however, with a pleasingly comic tableau as academics from England, Portugal and Poland bicker amiably at a conference and on Twitter about whose country is really the most centralised. The rest of the book is devoted to showing why the English academics were right, why it matters and what should be done about it.\n \n The main thrust of the text is an analysis of the impact of the dominant policy narratives around centralism and localism. The argument that Copus, Wall and Roberts put forward could be boiled down to the assertion that the problem with local government in England is that it is neither local nor government. But to make this case they first helpfully unpack several sets of concepts that are all too often elided together."

It has as problem the questioning about if the internet can serve as instrument of socialization and as a way of promoting the decisional autonomy of individuals, its users. To reach the purpose, it was done a bibliographical exploratory-explanatory search, qualitative, using the deductive method. As a search result, in summary, it has that, therefore in certain and specific situations, surely, the internet can favor the social isolation, since used according with the dictates recommended by common sense, with parsimony and respecting the limits of legality, can favor the socialization of individuals, and promote the improvement of their decisional autonomy. Concluding, therefore, that, the positive consequences related to the use of internet are really important, even in relation to the aspect of sociability and autonomous development.

Considering algorithmic ethical subjectivation \nhttps://doi.org/10.1177/2056305118768301\n João Carlos Magalhães \nMoral critiques of computational algorithms seem divided between two paradigms. One seeks to demonstrate how an opaque and unruly algorithmic power violates moral values and harms users’ autonomy; the other underlines the systematicity of such power, deflating concerns about opacity and unruliness. While the second paradigm makes it possible to think of end users of algorithmic systems as moral agents, the consequences of this possibility remain unexplored. This article proposes one way of tackling this problem. Employing Michel Foucault’s version of virtue ethics, I examine how perceptions of Facebook’s normative regulation of visibility have transformed non-expert end users’ ethical selves (i.e., their character) in the current political crisis in Brazil. The article builds on this analysis to advance algorithmic ethical subjectivation as a concept to make sense of these processes of ethical becoming. I define them as plural (encompassing various types of actions and values, and resulting in no determinate subject), contextual (demanding not only sociomaterial but also epistemological and ethical conditions), and potentially harmful (eventually structuring harms that are not externally inflicted by algorithms, but by users, upon themselves and others, in response to how they perceive the normativity of algorithmic decisions). By researching which model(s) of ethical subjectivation specific algorithmic social platforms instantiate, critical scholars might be able to better understand the normative consequences of these platforms’ power."

The problem is now becoming one of how to get these things to interact and collaborate with each other; to form intelligent environments amongst themselves and thus generate better services for users. This article explores a solution approach that consists in providing collaborative behavior to smart things, through the incorporation of an ontology and an architecture. It makes possible things that can communicate and collaborate with each other, allowing the generation of new services of interaction according to user needs. For this task, a real test bed of smart things was created, in which the proposed solution was deployed (Smart Room). Finally, it was concluded that the creation of these types of test bed is feasible, taking into account that response times and the information delivered by the different managed processes are acceptable. New challenges were encountered, however, such as problems of critical region in test beds with conflicting services and management of multiple users."

The change of approach advocated by the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFRL), implemented by Information and Communication Technology (ICT), has led to the Electronic European Language Portfolio (eELP). This new model involves a change in methodology, which benefits from new ways of managing information and interacting with the personal learning environment. METHOD. This article analyzes the development of autonomy through the eELP by using data collected in a qualitative study conducted on a group of students studying German (level A2.1 of the CEFRL) of the Official School of Languages of Alicante (Spain) between October 2016 and February 2017. The purpose of this study is to analyze the progression of the students in three subsections of the section Learning to learn of the eELP: Reflection and organization, Learning the new and Fixing the learned. RESULTS . If we analyze the results, we conclude that the eELP has encouraged the change of focus from the teacher to the student. Likewise, meaningful learning has meant that the activities have had to be adapted to the student in regards to goals, content and tasks, thus responding to the needs of the learner, so that it has been possible to integrate and restructure these activities in their world of experiences. DISCUSSION . The motivation of all the students has increased and they have developed confidence in themselves thanks to the positive formulation of their capacities through rubrics. In spite of the progress in autonomy, the implementation time has been insufficient to develop all the capacities that integrate autonomous learning."

The overarching question “What is the ‘Chinese-ness’ of the mobile phone user culture of young romantic couples regarding perpetual contact, boundary maintenance, and the connectedness-autonomy tension?” was answered by 15 semi-structured individual interviews. The findings suggest that 1) WeChat messaging was the most prominent mobile media platform used by the respondents to stay in “perpetual contact”, i.e., defined as a continuous conversation through frequent short messages between individuals not physically in the same location (Katz & Aakhus, 2002: p. 2). The interviewees wished to protect their relationship a couple by not disclosing too much or by preventing others from prying too far into it. 3) Respondents resolved the tension between the needs to connect with each other and to remain independent individuals by adopting the former approach. Respondents frequently practiced perpetual contact, supporting the Apparatgeist theory, which views mobile phones as mystical devices that allow constant communication with unseen others, combined with the collective construction of meaning (Katz & Aakhus, 2002). This current study further discusses relevant theoretical and social implications."

Defining an existential opportunity as the converse of an existential risk—that is, a development that promises to dramatically improve the future of humanity—we argue that one such opportunity is available and should be explored now. The opportunity resides in the moment of transition of the Internet—from mediating information to mediating distributed direct governance in the sense of self-organization. The Internet of tomorrow will mediate the execution of contracts, transactions, public interventions and all other change-establishing events more reliably and more synergistically than any other technology or institution. It will become a distributed, synthetically intelligent agent in itself. This transition must not be just observed, or exploited instrumentally: it must be ventured into and seized on behalf of entire humanity. We envision a configuration of three kinds of cognitive system—the human mind, social systems and the emerging synthetic intelligence—serving to augment the autonomy of the first from the ‘programming’ imposed by the second. Our proposition is grounded in a detailed analysis of the manner in which the socio-econo-political system has evolved into a powerful control mechanism that subsumes human minds, steers their will and automates their thinking. We see the venture into the existential opportunity described here as aiming at the global dissolution of the core reason of that programming’s effectiveness—the critical dependence of the continuity of human lives on the coherence of the socially constructed personas they ‘wear.’ Thus, we oppose the popular prediction of the upcoming, ‘dreadful AI takeover’ with a call for action: instead of worrying that Artificial Intelligence will soon come to dominate and govern the human world, let us think of how it could help the human being to finally be able to do it."

This represents a challenge, since it is complex to predict the effectiveness that an ICT (Information and Communication Technology) project will have in certain areas of the country that do not even have the necessary infrastructure to start up. To address this problem, it is important to provide schools with a System for Technological Management (STM), that allows them to identify, select, acquire, adopt and assimilate technologies. In this paper, the implementation of a quantitative model applied to a STM is presented. The quantitative model employs parameters of schools, regarding basic infrastructure such as essential services, computer devices, and connectivity, among others. The results of the proposed system are presented, where from the 5 possible points for the correct transfer, only 3.07 are obtained, where the highest is close to 0.88 with the availability of electric energy and the lowest is with the internet connectivity and availability with a 0.36 and 0.39 respectively which can strongly condition the success of the program."

This paper proposes an agent-based approach to distributed control for production environments in which the agents are only able to interact with a part of the whole system. It hypothesises that the performance of the agent network can be improved through learning and communication. A description of the approach is presented and illustrated with a simulation case of distributed control for an industrial compressed-air system."

Its main characteristic is that it occurs mainly on the social web, with the students sharing their journalistic productions in a collective blog and discussing their work on a Facebook page. The strategy also aims at developing the sense of autonomy and democratic participation of the students and their awareness of the values and practices of the profession. The strategy is the culmination of a three-cycle action-research project, developed over a period of five years, on how to educate journalists through innovative learning experiences based on new technologies. We believe that both the strategy and the research that led to it may be inspiring to educators and researchers concerned with the challenges of education on the social web."

To increase its public health impact, testing strategies that might increase the effectiveness of online computer-tailoring is a priority. The aim of this study is to explore the potential of message frame tailoring, by identifying the most autonomy-supportive message frame within an online health communication intervention aimed at the promotion of vegetable intake.\nMethods Two strategies will be studied that have been found to increase perceived autonomy-support in the face-to-face setting, i.e. offering choice and using non-controlling language. A 2 (choice vs. no choice) x 2 (non- controlling vs. controlling language) experiment will be conducted. Participants (N=492) will be recruited via a research panel and will be randomly assigned to one of the conditions. Measurements will occur before (T0; demographics, present behaviour) and directly post-intervention (T1; perceived autonomy-support).\nExpected results It is hypothesized that both offering choice and using non-controlling language increase perceived autonomy-support, but that the combination is most effective.\nCurrent stage of work Currently, intervention materials have been adjusted for use in each of the four conditions. Next steps will entail pre-testing among experts and the target population, finalizing intervention materials and data collection (expected in April-May 2017).\nDiscussion The results from this study will contribute to the increased effectiveness of online computer-tailored health communication, a low-cost health behaviour change strategy. As the Internet ensures a great reach, this increased effectiveness will improve its impact on public health."

Jonsen’s four topics approach was applied in the deliberative process for all cases. A comprehensive review of the case records of 28 patients referred consecutively to the CEC from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2014 was conducted. Data and information was collated from the referral forms, patient medical records, and emails communicated among CEC members. A deductive approach to thematic analysis based on Jonsen’s four topics approach was used to analyze the documents. Majority of the patients were male (94%), Chinese (76%), and above 65 years of age (41%). Ethical dilemmas surfaced due to differences in opinion regarding withholding of aggressive management (53%), withdrawing treatment (35%), and ascertaining patient’s autonomy (12%). In most cases, the patients’ preference on end-of-life care was unknown (82%). The main reasons for referral to the CEC were conflicts in clinical management and uncertainty about the decision-making capacity of patients. The CEC members tended to emphasize on “patient preference” more than the other quadrants in the four topics approach as they worked through each case. The Jonsen’s four topics approach lays the groundwork to frame ethical dilemmas that can be easily applied in the clinical setting and is a useful tool for the CEC’s teaching and discussion. Nonetheless, the approach only organizes ethical dilemmas and requires clinicians to apply own judgment in weighing ethical principles. Further studies can look into adapting the four topics approach to suit the local practices and context."

The project was selected and nominated since it provides a methodological approach and study strategies which favour multilingualism, mobility for young people and inclusiveness. The project is based on an online exchange between Italian students enrolled at the University of Padua and international students who will be coming to the University. It differs from many other telecollaboration projects in that it involves different languages, levels of language competence as well as various ways of interaction. Indeed, it implies three different ways of communication among participants: (1) one-to-one partnership in the students’ target language; (2) many-to-many interaction in Italian and/or English/French/Spanish as linguae francae on a Moodle platform and/or in a social Facebook area; (3) one-to-many multilingual interaction carried out by e-tutors in Facebook. They provide students with useful links regarding cultural events and things to do in Padua and its surroundings, as well as recent news and interesting linguistic and cultural issues related to different countries. Mobility, informality, autonomy, reciprocity, friendship, fun and multilingual community are the key words of this initiative whose objectives are aimed at developing linguistic, cultural, personal, social and digital skills in different languages, even in the less used and less taught ones."

Social media is integrated in schools and higher learning institutions for communication and reflection of learning which enhance teachers’ performance in leadership quality and effective teaching. This study was designed in a qualitative approach mainly to explore the extent of interest and enjoyment students experienced during an intensive ICT course. Blog was used as a medium for reflection during the class where students posted their creations of videos, posters and other ICT materials. The three needs investigated were namely autonomy, competence, and relatedness support. The researcher further examined on students’ awareness of the usefulness of the ICT skill they learned and how much they can use the blog for teaching and learning. Based on the Basic Psychological Needs Theory framework (BPNT), this study has adopted the direct observation, journal entry, and interviews as a triangulation approach."

A common critique aims at the limited validation of the tests as well as the risk of psycho-social stress or adaption of incorrect behavior by users triggered by misleading health information. Here, we examine in detail the specific role of advertising communication of DTC GT companies from a medical ethical perspective. Our argumentative analysis departs from the starting point that DTC GT operates at the intersection of two different contexts: medicine on the one hand and the market on the other. Both fields differ strongly with regard to their standards of communication practices and the underlying normative assumptions regarding autonomy and responsibility. Following a short review of the ethical contexts of medical and commercial communication, we provide case examples for persuasive messages of DTC GT websites and briefly analyze their design with a multi-modal approach to illustrate some of their problematic implications. We observe three main aspects in DTC GT advertising communication: (1) the use of material suggesting medical professional legitimacy as a trust-establishing tool, (2) the suggestion of empowerment as a benefit of using DTC GT services and (3) the narrative of responsibility as a persuasive appeal to a moral self-conception. While strengthening and respecting the autonomy of a patient is the focus in medical communication, specifically genetic counselling, persuasive communication is the normal mode in marketing of consumer goods, presuming an autonomous, rational, independent consumer. This creates tension in the context of DTC GT regarding the expectation and normative assessment of communication strategies. Our analysis can even the ground for a better understanding of ethical problems associated with intersections of medical and commercial communication and point to perspectives of analysis of DTC GT advertising."

These technologies although being applied to the domains of big data and deep learning are not adequate to cope with the scale and complexity of emerging connected, smart, and autonomous systems. This study explores the existing state-of-the-art in automating, augmenting, and integrating systems across the domains of smart cities, autonomous vehicles, energy efficiency, smart manufacturing in Industry 4.0, and healthcare. This is expanded to look at existing computational infrastructure and how it can be used to support these applications. A detailed review is presented of advances in approaches providing and supporting intelligence as a service. Finally, some of the remaining challenges due to the explosion of data streams; issues of safety and security; and others related to big data, a model of reality, augmentation of systems, and computation are examined."

Akaev \n Askar Sarygulov \n Valentin Sokolov \nThe industry development over the last hundred years has had a huge impact on the development of technological infrastructure and life change. Three main components of this development are related to personalization: a car as a personal vehicle and greater personal freedom; a personal computer as a means of intellectual autonomy; a personal phone as a means of freedom of communication and access to information. These three development factors significantly changed the employee psychology and created the conditions for diffusion of qualitatively new, synthesized (cyber-physical) technologies that became the basis of the Industry 4.0 and the Internet of Things – two main working concepts of industrial and infrastructural development for the next 20 years. The conventional or classical industrial systems that are dominant to the present day have mainly been based on the principles of human muscle energy replacement, but the technological changes of our days raise the question of the substantial scale of displacement of the living manpower both in production and in management and services. The process of technological and industrial transformation that has already begun will inevitably lead to the transformation of social and economic systems, and here the key problem will not only be the provision of a new quality of economic growth, but also the solution of the employment problem interfacing a new technological platform, the information and social infrastructure of society."

Self-tracking technologies are promoted and used as a means to self-improvement. Based on large aggregates of personal data and the data of other users, self-tracking technologies offer personalized feedback that nudges the user into behavioral change. The real-time personalization of choice architectures requires continuous surveillance and is a very powerful technology, recently coined as “hypernudging.” While users celebrate the increased personalization of their coaching devices, “hypernudging” technologies raise concerns about manipulation. This paper addresses that intuition by claiming that decisional privacy is at stake. It thus counters the trend to solely focus on informational privacy when evaluating information and communication technologies. It proposes that decisional privacy and informational privacy are often part of a mutually reinforcing dynamic. Hypernudging is used as a key example to illustrate that the two dimensions should not be treated separately. Hypernudging self-tracking technologies compromise autonomy because they violate informational and decisional privacy. In order to effectively judge whether technologies that use hypernudges empower users, we need both privacy dimensions as conceptual tools."

Rather, upholding patriarchy and dominion over women’s reproduction historically served political purposes and entrenched social and cultural norms that framed women’s capacities almost exclusively as service to a husband, mothering, reproducing, and sexual chattel. In turn, such social norms—often enforced by statutes and legal opinions—took root in rhetoric rather than the realities of women’s humanity, experiences, capacities, autonomy, and lived lives. As such, law created legal fictions about women and their supposed lack of intellectual and social capacities. Law trapped women to the destinies courts and legislatures aspired for them and continues to do so. This Essay turns to the less engaged international sphere and the copious Congressional Record to unpack how the Helms Amendment and later, the Mexico City Policy (or Global Gag Rule), emerged from this type of lawmaking. This Essay shows how these harmful dictates on women’s lives and bodies in developing nations result in a deadly rise of illegal abortions, criminal punishments, stigmatization, and sadly, deaths."

Facebook push notifications are conceptualized as starting point of a chain of persuasive offerings. A push notification is successful, i.e. has high persuasiveness when adressed users react on it, enter the platform and stay longer in Facebook. Facebook push notifications as well as entertainment and media offerings of the platform result in an escapist consumtion of the offered content by the platform. The empirical results reveal that self-control is negatively related to triggered Facebook escapism. Usability of push Facebook notifications is positively related to triggered Facebook escapism. Triggered Facebook escapism furthermore results in positive effects for users in term of enjoyment, autonomy, competence and relatedness. It is negatively related to feeling of guilt."

Artificial Intelligence technologies have a basic feature that is self-governing, autonomy in decision-making. Artificial Intelligence’s self-governing is a challenge at the population level, which requires to build the right digital architectonics. This issue concerns not only diagnostics and treatment of diseases, but also the accessibility of medical services for population. It is necessary to broader consider the role of Health Care in common economic structure of Internet of Things, and create an anthropocentric infrastructure, in which all types of digital transactions will be included in co-financing of Health Care. This measure wouldn’t allow to separate medical services from all segments of Internet of Things, otherwise Health Care financing would be critically cut. The multifunctional cards, such as the «Mir» card, is the first step towards digital integration. This card includes electronic access to medical services and prescriptions along with the ability to pay for travel on transport and other applications as the «Social Card of Moscow citizen»."

Lai \n S. Yu \nBackground: According to the Self-determination Theory, psychological need satisfaction and gaming motives are potentially salient factors of behavioural addictions such as Internet gaming disorder (IGD). This study examined the mediating role of gaming motives on in-game psychological need satisfaction (i.e., Autonomy, Competence, and Relatedness) and IGD tendency. Methods: Chinese adult online gamers (N=383) were recruited and completed an online anonymous questionnaire survey. The questionnaire was composed of Player Experience of Need Satisfaction (for assessing In-game competence, autonomy, and relatedness), Motive for Online Gaming Questionnaire (for assessing General, Escape, Coping, Fantasy, Skill Development, Recreation, Competition, and Social motives), DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for IGD, and demographic items. With demographic items included as controlled variables, the path analysis using Mplus 7.4 was conducted to predict Rasch-scaled IGD tendency score from the DSM-5 criteria. Findings: In our path model, in-game need satisfaction was significantly related to gaming motives. For example, In-game relatedness was positively associated with Social (β=.43) and negatively related to Recreation and Competition (β = −.20 and −.17). All three types of need satisfaction were positively associated with General Motivation (β range= .23-.30). The significant, direct risk factors for IGD included male gender, In-game autonomy, General Motivation, and Escape motive (β range= .17-.26), while Skill Development and Recreation motives (β = −.16 and −.10) were protective factors. Discussion: Our findings suggested gaming motives mediating the effect of psychological need satisfaction on IGD tendency. Future intervention programs should also take specific psychological risk factors such as perceived autonomy and Escape motive into account."

Every leading smartphone operating system comes with a personal AI assistant that promises to help you with basic cognitive tasks: searching, planning, messaging, scheduling and so on. Usage of such devices is effectively a form of algorithmic outsourcing: getting a smart algorithm to do something on your behalf. Many have expressed concerns about this algorithmic outsourcing. They claim that it is dehumanising, leads to cognitive degeneration, and robs us of our freedom and autonomy. Some people have a more subtle view, arguing that it is problematic in those cases where its use may degrade important interpersonal virtues. In this article, I assess these objections to the use of AI assistants. I will argue that the ethics of their use is complex. There are no quick fixes or knockdown objections to the practice, but there are some legitimate concerns. By carefully analysing and evaluating the objections that have been lodged to date, we can begin to articulate an ethics of personal AI use that navigates those concerns. In the process, we can locate some paradoxes in our thinking about outsourcing and technological dependence, and we can think more clearly about what it means to live a good life in the age of smart machines."

Valavanis \nThis review paper presents the Entropy approach to modeling and performance evaluation of Intelligent Machines (IMs), which are modeled as hierarchical, multi-level structures. It provides a chronological summary of developments related to intelligent control, from its origins to current advances. It discusses fundamentals of the concept of Entropy as a measure of uncertainty and as a control function, which may be used to control, evaluate and improve through adaptation and learning performance of engineering systems. It describes a multi-level, hierarchical, architecture that is used to model such systems, and it defines autonomy and machine intelligence for engineering systems, with the aim to set foundations necessary to tackle related challenges. The modeling philosophy for the systems under consideration follows the mathematically proven principle of Increasing Precision with Decreasing Intelligence (IPDI). Entropy is also used in the context of N-Dimensional Information Theory to model the flow of information throughout such systems and contributes to quantitatively evaluate uncertainty, thus, autonomy and intelligence. It is explained how Entropy qualifies as a unique, single, measure to evaluate autonomy, intelligence and precision of task execution. The main contribution of this review paper is that it brings under one forum research findings from the 1970’s and 1980’s, and that it supports the argument that even today, given the unprecedented existing computational power, advances in Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning and Control Theory, the same foundational framework may be followed to study large-scale, distributed Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs), including distributed intelligence and multi-agent systems, with direct applications to the SmartGrid, transportation systems and multi-robot teams, to mention but a few applications."

Heath \nAbstract Research has revealed that the push to engage in video games is in part the perception that they satisfy three basic psychological needs (competence, autonomy, relatedness). However, the pull toward a problematic style of video game engagement based on Internet Gaming Disorder symptomatology has been found to be explained in part by the daily frustration of these same needs. Currently, these two areas of gaming research have been conducted within separate studies. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to bridge these two theoretically compatible areas of research in exploring the interaction between gaming need satisfaction and daily need frustration in explaining problem video game use and gaming frequency. An online sample of 922 adults (59.1% males; Mage = 23.53 years; SD = 6.84) were recruited. Results revealed both gaming need satisfaction and daily need frustration positively contributed to gaming frequency and problem video game use accounting for 19.7% and 23.5% of their respective variances. Furthermore, gaming frequency and problem video game use were highest when both gaming need satisfaction and daily need frustration were high. The implications of these results are discussed within the context of current research and strengths-based clinical approaches."

The methodology of the research is based on the use of methods: scientific generalization, systematization, comparison, modelling. The object of research is the activity of scientific libraries of research universities, which strive to vary in the current conditions of rapid technological development. The research results consist of the systematization of the main and secondary functions of scientific libraries of research universities. A new economic category of “digital franchising” has been proposed and characterized as a model of cooperation between the franchisor and the franchisee when the rights to use and represent the company of the franchisor in the intercontinental digital space are transferred. The franchisee has the right to use the company name, services, goods, technological processes, and software of the franchisor to create its own digital network of sub-franchisees and digital products on the basis of the conditions specified in the contract. Such kind of franchising will allow settling relations in a digital cyberspace, promptly developing and getting new, yet not completely studied forms. Comparison of traditional and digital models of franchising has allowed to show differences on ten basic criteria: costs for building a network; speed of interaction; level of managerial flexibility; updating of the system; the possibility of expanding the network; financial control; brand management; rate of return; the speed of information about new services; need for operational management. The revealed discrepancies are mainly characterized by different time frames for implementing managerial decisions and excellent approaches to the formation and use of the necessary financial and organizational resources. The author has developed an innovative franchise model, which makes it possible to effectively commercialize the services of scientific libraries. This model is based on the use of franchising by building a broad network of digital services. The peculiarity of digital franchising is revealed, which consists in the essential optimization of expenses for organizing the activities of scientific libraries, in comparison with the traditional model, and speeding up the pace and quality of service. The practical significance of the obtained results lies in new opportunities for pushing a new wave of development of methods for commercializing the services of scientific libraries of research universities and their dissemination at the global level. Using the developed innovative franchise model will be useful for theorists and practitioners engaged in the development of strategies for the development of research universities and their scientific libraries. The main conclusion of the research is that the introduction of a developed marketing tool by talented managers with an entrepreneurial type of thinking will become a source of financial autonomy for scientific libraries of research universities they manage. Digital expansion in a strategic perspective will absorb all the major information flows that affect the development of the world. Libraries of research universities, as key centres for aggregation and translation of scientific information and knowledge, should be ready for such scenario and already experiment with new tools for the future, which is digital franchising."

The reasons behind this preference for online shopping are examined in this study through 63 in-depth interviews and five years of virtual ethnography of a major online shopping website— Taobao.com —in China. Chinese customers prefer Taobao not only because of price and convenience, but also because they enjoy the interactional process, during which they obtain more information, feel less pressured to put on a status performance in comparison to physical stores, and pay less affective labor. Chinese customers tend to believe that interaction with sales clerks in physical shops is a burden, and try to avoid this form of contact. This is related to the fact that consensus on status hierarchy is still yet to be established in a society that is undergoing rapid transition. Consequently, online shopping entails social interaction that attributes more power, autonomy and freedom to customers than otherwise possible in brick-and-mortar shopping. This study shows how both the online interactional environments afforded by technology and the broader social contexts (the service quality and related aspects of status competition among different social groups in contemporary China) affect interpersonal interaction."

Do they internationalize ad hoc or do they plan an internationalization strategy? Which resources are needed for the internationalization process? Research Design & Methods : The author used qualitative approach with CATI ( Computer Assisted Telephone Interview ), PAPI ( Paper & Pen Personal Interview ) and CAII ( Computer Assisted Internet Interview ) methods. 420 questionnaires were used in the statistical analysis. Findings: This study focuses on the evaluation of entrepreneurship orientation as the main resource of the internationalization nature (ad hoc or a strategic plan) of family businesses from Poland and measured it through the four elements proposed by Covin and Slevin (1989): Innovation, Proactivity, Autonomy and Risk. Implications & Recommendations:  To internationalise, family business families need to apply entrepreneurship orientation, especially proactiveness towards new challenges, and strategic planning and tools. Contribution & Value Added:  The research provides evidence of a higher degree of EO in the behaviour of a family. More successful family businesses are in international markets. They also have a challenge oriented culture, which means that such companies are oriented towards new ventures, new relations, new solutions and new markets. But they plan new challenges using the strategic approach."

Pepper \nAgeing societies and the increase in chronic disabilities are irrevocable trends in the EU which usually result in a loss of autonomy and increased social isolation. Many people with complex disabilities face increased isolation due to loss of independent mobility because of difficulties of meeting the criteria for the provision of an Electric Powered Wheelchair (EPW) and the availability of an appropriate EPW. Several studies highlight the key role of innovative Assistive Technologies and smart EPW as effective tools to empower disabled people and improve social inclusion. Nevertheless, standardization, interoperability, limited involvement of users, lack of specialist training for health professionals and funding models are which impede the uptake of such innovations. Within this framework, a transdisciplinary consortium of French and English partners formed the 4 year ADAPT project, starting in May 2017. The aim of ADAPT is to overcome the barriers to the uptake of assistive technology. The ADAPT project aims to: - Develop two technologically mature innovative assistive technologies: * A smart EPW with driving assistance to compensate for user disabilities, to monitor and report changes users’ health through the internet. * A Virtual Reality EPW simulator platform. This will give the user an immersive experience of the smart EPW and train them to drive in everyday life. Professionals will assess the suitability of the EPW for particular patients and environments and gain understanding from the user perspective. - Develop training programs for healthcare professionals about innovative assistive technologies. - Formalize agreements between research institutions and companies ranging from local to international meetings, so as to boost R&D and facilitate the uptake of the ADAPT’s results by the market. This presentation will provide an opportunity to share an overview of the ADAPT project: context, objectives and results."

During this time, the countries transformed from developing to advanced economies due to strategic planning and a larger vision that correlated economic development to transformation in the education sector, in particular Higher Education and Research, to become globally competitive. Despite many new National Missions/Programs and reforms agenda, by both the central and state governments with private sector intervention, the higher education sector is in a state of complete flux in India. While we have tremendously enhanced capacity, we lag in quality, given inadequate autonomy to our Universities. Centralized control and a standardized approach remains at the heart of regulations (FICCI, 2013). This paper, newly explains about the Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA)/National Higher Education Mission, a Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) for reforming the State Higher Education System in India.

Through comparing specific musicians’ practices and narratives, I argue Pernambucan state sponsorship is a mechanism which redefines citizenship on entrepreneurial terms and reinforces structural inequality. As government programs provide new opportunities to formalize and professionalize their labor, musicians face more bureaucratic and socioeconomic challenges that require them to broaden their musical labor to include skills like social media marketing and grant proposal writing. These expectations are difficult enough for middle-class, educated musicians to meet, but even harder for marginalized, lower-class, and racialized citizens to manage. By comparing how three musicians construct themselves as business-oriented, transnational, or patrimonial entrepreneurs, the article makes explicit what similar studies suggest, but often leave implicit: professionalism and entrepreneurialism are increasingly interdependent. Furthermore, while the entrepreneurial self is predicated on autonomy, these musicians’ autonomy paradoxically depends on a combination of social networks and state sponsorship. In sum, the article reveals how individuals are creating new subjectivities to adapt to changing economic conditions."

Bailis \nWhen facing setbacks and obstacles, the dualistic model of passion outlines that obsessive passion, and not harmonious passion, will predict greater levels of defensiveness. Our aim was to determine whether these passion dimensions predicted defensiveness in the same way when confronted with threatening messages targeting the decision to pursue a passion.Across four studies with passionate Facebook users, hockey fans, and runners (total N = 763), participants viewed messages giving reasons why their favorite activity should not be pursued. Participants either reported their desire to read the messages (Studies 1 and 2) or evaluated the messages after reading them (Studies 3 and 4).Harmonious passion consistently predicted higher levels of avoidance or negative evaluations of the messages. These responses were attenuated for participants who had previously affirmed an important value (Study 1), or who were told that they do not control the passions they pursue (Study 4).Harmonious passion entails a sense of autonomy and control over activity engagement, which usually leads to nondefensive behavior. However, this sense of control may elicit more defensive responses from more harmoniously passionate individuals when the decision itself to pursue an activity is under attack."

This research is aimed towards providing a framework for the development of entrepreneurship based on ICT with a particular focus on Indonesia as a developing country by exploring business incubation processes in a techno park. The research used a qualitative method. The data are gathered through in-depth interviews based on a purposive sampling by including actors who have been involved in business incubations in a techno park in Indonesia. The results show that the techno park may have generally had limitations, including its process, tools, a low efficiency and a lack of financial autonomy. Still, the incubation process has been proven to have a role in increasing the work performance of start-ups, market expansion, and improving accessibility to funding sources. This research offers theoretical and empirical implications towards the development of business incubation processes in entrepreneurship activity."

Sternberg \n Bijan Najafi \n<b><i>Background:</i></b> With the increasing global population of older adults, there is a need for environmental interventions that directly affect their physical, psychological, and emotional well-being to help them maintain or regain their independence and autonomy – all of which promote longevity. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> To better understand potential opportunities and challenges associated with interior design and “future homes” that may promote well-being, aging in place, and independent living in older adults, the authors reviewed relevant literature and included their own expert opinions from a multidisciplinary point of view including interior design, wellness, and engineering. <b><i>Results:</i></b> After summarizing existing environmental interventions for the aging population and their effectiveness, this review reveals knowledge gaps in interior design for the well-being and longevity of older adults followed by a discussion of opportunities for future research that may fill these gaps. Some of these opportunities include finding habilitative design strategies that identify and address unique situational needs of each user, advancing multidisciplinary fields such as environmental gerontology that recreate security and independence for older adults even outside of their homes, implementing technically advanced design strategies, which are flexible and adaptive to individual needs; and integrating the Internet of things (IoT) into living environments, including voice-activated command technologies to improve seniors’ central role in enabling an optimized healthcare ecosystem. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Knowledge of current evidence regarding the impact of different environmental factors may hasten adaptation of well-designed innovations that can provide optimal healing and living environments for the aging population. By effectively addressing older adults’ unique and specialized needs, design practitioners can become an indispensable part of their medical, social, and environmental team. One of the rapidly developing infrastructures promising to revolutionize the design of “future homes” is the IoT. While it is at an early stage of development, ultimately we envisage a connected home using voice-controlled technology and Bluetooth-radio-connected add-ons, to augment much of what home health does today. Bringing these approaches together into an effective strategy for a model of effective geriatric care is important and needs to become an integral part of both design education and practice."

Particularly, in the author’s real teaching context at Thuong Mai University (TMU), there exists a serious problem relating to students’ lack of independency in language learning. The study, therefore, was implemented to investigate the effectiveness of the Internet use in promoting business learners’ autonomy and improving their learning skill. To fulfill the study, questionnaires and interviews were conducted to 200 third-year students and 10 teachers of English at TMU respectively. The qualitative approach was adopted to reveal the significant findings of the descriptive case study on the learners’ positive attitudes and awareness of their learning autonomy through the popularity yet ineffective use of the Internet use but the ineffective use of the Internet in improving English study and motivation, what and how teachers and learners do to promote learners’ autonomy in language learning. The study, consequently, came up with some effective pedagogical implications that may help teachers recognize the significant role of the Internet in enhancing learners’ autonomy inside and outside the class."

We call this process, which takes data about patients as input and derives a confidence estimate for a particular patient’s predicted health care-related decision as an output, the autonomy algorithm. We suggest that the proposed algorithm would result in more accurate predictions than existing methods, which are resource intensive and consider only small patient cohorts.

Our theoretical development builds upon two psychological theories, namely self-determination and psychological ownership, to identify five psychological needs (needs for autonomy, relatedness, competence, having a place, and self-identity), that we posit are particularly pertinent to social media use. According to NAF, these psychological needs will motivate use of those social media applications that provide salient affordances to fulfill these needs. We identify such affordances through a comprehensive review of the literature and of social media applications and put forth propositions that map the affordances to the psychological needs that they fulfill. Our theory development generates important implications. First, it has implications for social media research in that it provides an overarching comprehensive framework for the affordances of social media as a whole and the related psychological needs that motivate their use. Future studies can leverage NAF to identify psychological needs motivating the use of specific social media sites based on the affordances the sites provide, and design science research can leverage NAF in the design and bundling of specific social media features to engage users. Second, it has implications for technology acceptance research in that NAF can enrich existing models by opening up the mechanisms through which psychological needs influence user perceptions of social media and their use patterns and behaviors. Finally, NAF provides a new lens and common vocabulary for future studies, which we hope can stimulate cumulative research endeavors to develop a comprehensive framework of information systems affordances in general and the psychological needs that information systems satisfy."

Parker \nIn 2012, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) lifted the experimental label on oocyte preservation, but cautioned against women using it to avoid age-related infertility, known as social egg freezing (SEF). In 2014, Facebook and Apple announced that they would offer SEF as a workplace benefit. Within the context of a rapidly growing market for SEF, we were interested in how these two decisions affected media discussions, given that such discourse can strongly influence public perceptions and behaviors. We used a content analysis methodology to code 138 articles published in U.S. newspapers and magazines between 2012 and 2015. Focusing on a financial concern over the cost of SEF and the lack of insurance for SEF, we found that media portrayals of SEF pivot away from the ethical principle of nonmaleficence centered in the ASRM decision to discourage SEF. Instead, they highlight an issue of justice that can be remedied through the offer of SEF as a workplace benefit. Overall, media portrayals of SEF paint a simplistic and rosy picture that more options, especially more reproductive and economic options, automatically enhance women’s autonomy."

Combining research in central and regional archives, interviews conducted during fieldwork, and published sources (including from online social networks), this article reviews the institutional foundations and recruitment and working methods for this little-known form of environmental activism, which began in the Soviet period. Combining a high degree of social elitism with a vigilante approach and a corporatist desire for autonomy, it contributed to the emergence of a dedicated green movement during the period of democratization in Russia (1987–93), before gradually fading away. It is now experiencing a certain revival under Vladimir Putin’s regime as a movement that represents both nostalgia for the late Soviet period and the renewal of expert-led protest in opposition to authoritarianism."

Studies including a control group and reporting pre- and post-intervention ratings of SDT-related psychosocial mediators (namely perceived autonomy support, need satisfaction and motivation) with children or adults were included. Risk of bias was assessed using items from the Cochrane risk of bias tool. 2496 articles were identified of which 74 met inclusion criteria; 80% were RCTs or cluster RCTs. Techniques to promote need supportive environments were coded according to two established taxonomies (BCTv1 and MIT), and 21 SDT-specific techniques, and grouped into 18 SDT based strategies. Weighted mean effect sizes were computed using a random effects model; perceived autonomy support g = 0.84, autonomy g = 0.81, competence g = 0.63, relatedness g = 0.28, and motivation g = 0.41. One-to-one interventions resulted in greater competence satisfaction than group-based (g = 0.96 vs. 0.28), and competence satisfaction was greater for adults (g = 0.95) than children (g = 0.11). Meta-regression analysis showed that individual strategies had limited independent impact on outcomes, endorsing the suggestion that a need supportive environment requires the combination of multiple co-acting techniques."

Two EFL reading classes of 70 students acted as an experimental and a control group participated in this study. A questionnaire was administered to collect the quantitative data from the participants prior to and post the interventional programme. The experimental group utilised their own smartphone features and applications (dictionaries, WhatsApp, camera, internet search engines, notes, and recorders) to employ the social strategies of asking for clarification and correction, cooperating and empathising with others inside and outside the classroom for 12 weeks whereas the control group learned using the traditional methods. The findings of the study revealed that the employment of social strategies mediated by smartphone features and applications promoted the learners’ socio-culturally autonomous learning characteristics of interaction, interdependence, self-regulation, self-worth, mutual support, and understating in EFL reading context. It is recommended strategy use training programmes and smartphones integration in language learning should be highly considered in curricula design, teaching and learning methods, training programmes in order to empower learners to take more responsible roles in the learning of EFL reading skills."

Gorman \n Nancy J. Cooke \nProject overview. The current study focuses on analyzing team flexibility by measuring entropy (where higher values correspond to system reorganization and lower values correspond to more stable system organization) across all-human teams and Human-Autonomy Teams (HAT). We analyzed teams in the context of a fully-fledged synthetic agent that acts as a pilot for a three-agent Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) ground crew. The synthetic agent must be able to communicate and coordinate with human teammates in a constructive and timely manner to be effective. This study involved three heterogeneous team members who had to take photographs of target waypoints and communicate via a text-based communication system. The three team members’ roles were: 1) navigator provides information about flight plan with speed and altitude restrictions at each waypoint; 2) pilot adjusts altitude and airspeed to control the Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA), and negotiates with the photographer about the current altitude and airspeed to take good photos for the targets; and 3) photographer screens camera settings, and sends feedback to other team members regarding the target photograph status. The three conditions differed based on the manipulation of the pilot role: 1) Synthetic – the pilot was the synthetic agent, 2) Control – the pilot was a randomly assigned participant, and 3) Experimenter – the pilot was a well-trained experimenter who focused on sending and receiving information in a timely manner. The goal of this study is to examine how overall RPAS flexibility across HATs and all-human teams are associated with Team Situation Awareness (TSA). Method. There were 30 teams (10-teams per condition): control teams consisted of three participants randomly assigned to each role; synthetic and experimenter teams included two participants randomly assigned to the navigator and photographer roles. The experiment took place over five 40-minute missions, and the goal was to take as many “good” photos of ground targets as possible while avoiding alarms and rule violations. We obtained several measures, including mission and target level team performance scores, team process measures (situation awareness, process ratings, communication and coordination), and other measures (teamwork knowledge, workload, and demographics). We first estimated amount of system reorganization of the RPAS via an information entropy measure, i.e., the number of arrangements the system occupied over a given period of time (Shannon & Weaver, 1975). Based on information entropy, we defined four layers to represent the RPAS (Gorman, Demir, Cooke, & Grimm, In Review): 1) communications - the chat-based communication among team members; 2) vehicle - the RPA itself, e.g., speed, altitude; 3) control - interface between the RPA and the user; and system - the overall activity of the sub-layers. Then, we looked at the relationship between layers and TSA, which was based on successfully overcoming and completing ad hoc embedded target waypoints. Results and conclusion. Overall, the experimenter teams adapted to more roadblocks than the synthetic teams, who were equivalent to control teams (Demir, McNeese, & Cooke, 2016). The findings indicate that: 1) synthetic teams demonstrated rigid systems level activity, which consisted of less reorganization of communication, control and vehicle layers as conditions changed, which also resulted in less adaptation to roadblocks; 2) control teams demonstrated less communication reorganization, but more control and vehicle reorganization, which also resulted in less adaptation to roadblocks; and 3) experimenter teams demonstrated more reorganization across communication, control and vehicle layers, which resulted in better adaptation to roadblocks. Thus, the ability of a system to reorganize across human and technical layers as situations change is needed to adapt to novel conditions of team performance in a dynamic task"

The purpose of the study is the problem of forming a knowledge model of a specialist with higher education that is a part of an educational project. Its relevance is related to the need for an adequate response to strengthening the scientific and technological progress dynamics and the transition to the information interactions economy in the current conditions of the higher education system. Materials and methods. The information base of the research includes the laws on education of the Russian Federation, educational standards of higher professional education, scientists’ publications on the issues under investigation. The study used the following methods: system analysis, active systems theory, reflexive control theory, and modeling. Results. The research analyzes the consequences of Russia’s entry into the Bologna Convention on education. It shows that this event caused the problem of efficiency and quality of training specialists, as well as the problem of integrating higher education institutions into a new social and economic system related to their adaptation to market relations. According to the principle of institutional autonomy, solution of these problems is the responsibility of universities. The paper shows that the way to solve these problems is to transfer universities to a design and technological type of administration. The most promising form of education project management is the model of information interaction within the framework of active self-developing network expert environments. The elementary part of such an environment is an expert professional, who owns modern telecommunication technologies and Internet means. Integration in the natural intelligence network structure forms a collective strategic subject, which is a tool of a knowledge and action synergy in the interaction process. The paper describes the developed structure of the active self-developing network expert environment and two principles of its functioning as an active multi-agent system when forming a specialist knowledge model. It is proposed to consider the construction of specialist’s knowledge model in the context of corporate knowledge management strategies in organizations to increase competitiveness, as the established support systems for organization knowledge lifecycle and specialist’s integral knowledge model are used to integrate strategic corporate tasks with strategic tasks of developing employees’ corporate knowledge. They consider a specialist as an element of a company production system. His purpose is to give a product specified quantitative and qualitative parameters that ensure its competitive advantages. To carry out production activities, a specialist uses a complex of abilities, knowledge and skills that should be considered as models of his production and technological activities. At each moment, this complex should be considered as a subjective model of its production and technological activity. This creates a basis for a university self-development process by involving advanced consumers using network technologies in the innovative process of improving educational services, receiving ideas or content by referring to their creative abilities in exchange for a reward that corresponds to a contribution. The paper proposes a system that provides a direction for finding solutions and ideas, as well as filtering, summarizing information, determining its value and prospects. It is shown that the method of improving the quality of solutions on an educational project is the synthesis of crowdsourcing technologies, network expertise and the methodology of the active systems theory. Conclusions. The proposed approach allows considering the process of extracting new ideas and knowledge when forming a specialist’s knowledge model as an active system with heterogeneous agents with a counter way of sharing information and active influence of the center in the form of queries to obtain reflexive estimates. It also allows ensuring the interaction of universities and an organization in managing their intellectual capital."

Smith \nTransatlantic security cooperation entered a new era after the 9/11 attacks in America, the launch of EU crisis management/security assistance operations, and the release of the European Security Strategy (ESS) in 2003. Since then, years of practical experience have inspired the EU to enhance its ambitions in this realm by developing a Cybersecurity Strategy, a Maritime Security Strategy, and most recently, the 2016 EU Global Strategy (EUGS). As these efforts respect NATO’s primary role in European defence, there is more scope for practical EU-US collaboration regarding crisis management and security assistance operations. However, although there have been some clear successes here, the EU is also increasingly willing to forge its own path in this realm and possibly diverge with US priorities. This article evaluates the recent record of, and prospects for, EU-US security collaboration regarding various problems mentioned as strategic priorities in the ESS, EUGS, and related documents"

L. Oliveira \n Rui Fonseca-Pinto \nAbstract According to estimates by the World Health Organization, the average life expectancy will continue to rise. This indicator, being a measure of success in terms of healthcare, is not synonymous with quality of life and will increase healthcare costs. Associated with this problem are also the changes in terms of the organization of society, which has not been able to solve these constraints of functional limitations, dementia, social isolation, and loneliness. This paper presents the concept of adaptive surveillance based on mobile technology and artificial intelligence, presented in the context of a global physical activity monitoring program (MOVIDA), in his domus dimension designed to the elderly people with some functional limitation or dementia. The proposed solution for an adaptive surveillance is thus to conduct direct supervision programs, to enroll persons who live alone or in nursing homes who need supervision without limiting their individual autonomy. The preliminary results show that it is possible to use the data obtained from a mobile smartphone to identify routines and use this information to identify daily patterns. Changes to these routine patterns can be used to generate alarms for caregivers."

We also sought to identify the paradoxical perceptions regarding this mobile technology. Method: The research was based on a qualitative methodology, with the conducting in-depth interviews with 12 users, using the technique of content analysis. Results: It was verified that certain smartphone users have strong emotional attachment to your device, considering it as an extension of your own identity. Were also highlighted four technological paradoxes in the behavior of use: Dependency x independence, Observed by discomfort in the absence of the appliance and at the same time the mobility that the smartphone delivers bringing greater independence; Autonomy x addiction; Satisfaction x Creation of needs; New x obsolete. Theoretical contributions: This research opens lines of research covering aspects linked to areas of consumer behavior and information systems regarding the use of smartphones. Originality / relevance: Due to the fact of the smartphones being considered a recent technology, the relationship about self extended on the use of the smartphone still was slightly raised, both in national and international literature. This research is based on an integrated vision of consumer behavior, psychology and information systems. The propositions of this study assume that the Blackberry smartphone can be considered an extension of the identity of the user, due to the degree of involvement between both and, as a result of this involvement, can emerge paradoxes technology, i.e., the opposing perceptions about the use of the smartphone."

The importance of ensuring the autonomy of universities in the development of curricula and the choice of forms of education, promotion of the development of general competencies is stated. Basic requirements of the Strategy for a reasonable, sustainable and comprehensive growth of Europe 2020 are named, results of research on knowledge, skills and competences of future specialists demanded by Europe in 2030 and further are presented. The key trends of the EU policy in the field of education and culture, the EU “Erasmus +” program and Ukraine’s participation in the EU “Eastern Partnership” initiative, improvement of intercultural understanding, civic participation and ethical awareness, as well as ensuring equitable access to higher education in a united and inclusive society are determined. Worldwide, including the European Higher Education Area, experience of solving educational problems has confirmed the thesis about the importance of integrating competencies of all types, as each of them contributes to a successful life in a knowledge-based society. It is summed up that general knowledge of languages, education, ability to quantitative thinking and awareness in the field of information and communication technologies is the necessary basis for learning, and education for the sake of knowledge includes the whole educational activity.  Measures are identified and the goals for ensuring comprehensive and sustainable development, social cohesion and further enhancement of the democratic culture of the European Union countries are set out. In order to progressively develop the European Higher Education Area, it is necessary to intensify interdisciplinary and cross-border cooperation, as well as to develop inclusive and innovative approaches to learning and teaching"

Except for the pseudo-scientific study of Andrew Wakefield (1998), which has since been contested several times in serious scientific researches, as well as a few medical doctors in Serbia who referred to it, the whole of expert stakeholders, and epidemiologists in particular, has fiercely opposed the dangerous trend of parents renouncing compulsory vaccination of their children. This article aims to show that the consent to compulsory vaccination of children is not a matter of the right to autonomy in the field of medicine - which implies the freedom of every human being to decide on one’s own life and body - but instead a matter of public health, which inevitably means of public interest as well, a matter which should be decided by competent professionals."

Text messaging and Facebook are feasible and acceptable delivery modes for PA interventions among youth. However, little is known about the opinion of vocational school-aged adolescents regarding behavioural change techniques that can be applied through Facebook or text messaging. Therefore, our aim was to gain insight into the opinions of vocational school-aged adolescents towards the use of different behaviour change techniques and towards Facebook/text messaging as a delivery mode for PA interventions. Six focus groups were conducted with 41 adolescents from the first grade (12-14 years) of secondary vocational schools in Flanders (Belgium). In total 41 adolescents participated and completed a questionnaire about their text messaging and Facebook use prior to group discussions. Focus group discussions were audio-recorded and analysed using a thematic analysis method in Nvivo. Participants thought that different behaviour change techniques (e.g., providing feedback, goal setting, self-monitoring, social comparison) could be integrated in a PA intervention using text messaging and Facebook and were enthusiastic about participating in such an intervention. They indicated that text messages are an easy way to receive information about PA, and that a group page on Facebook is ideal to share information with others. Participants deemed it very important that the group page on Facebook would only include peers with whom they also share an offline connection. Furthermore, adolescents stressed the importance of having autonomy (e.g., to determine their personal activity goals, to self-monitor their behaviour) and of being active together with friends. This qualitative study revealed that the use of Facebook and text messaging is promising as a delivery method for PA interventions among vocational school-aged adolescents. The adolescents were keen to participate in an intervention that integrates behaviour change techniques using text messaging or Facebook."

    "text": "Doc 978 :  Legally Cognizable Manipulation \nhttps://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3224952\n Ido Kilovaty \nSwaths of personal and nonpersonal information collected online about Internet users are increasingly being used in sophisticated ways for online political manipulation. This represents a new trend in the exploitation of data, where instead of pursuing direct financial gain based on the face value of the data, actors engage in data analytics using advanced artificial intelligence technologies that allow them to more easily access individuals’ cognition and future behavior. Although in recent years the concept of online manipulation has received some academic and policy attention, the desirable relationship between cybersecurity law and online manipulation is not yet fully explored. In other words, regulators and courts have yet to realize the importance of linking cybersecurity law to individual autonomy, privacy, and democracy.\nThis Article provides an account of the desirable relationship between cybersecurity law and other values, such as autonomy, privacy, and democracy, by looking at the phenomenon of online manipulation achieved through psychographic profiling. It argues that the volume, efficacy, and sophistication of present online manipulation techniques pose a considerable and immediate danger to autonomy, privacy, and democracy. Internet actors, political entities, and foreign adversaries carefully study the personality traits and vulnerabilities of Internet users and, increasingly, target each such user with an individually tailored stream of information or misinformation with the intent of exploiting the weaknesses of these individuals. This Article makes a broader argument about cybersecurity law and its narrow focus on identity theft and financial fraud. Primarily, this Article looks at data-breach notification law, a subset of cybersecurity law, as reflective of that limited scope. It argues that data-breach notification law could provide a much-needed backdrop for the challenges presented by online manipulation, while alleviating the sense of lawlessness engulfing current misuses of personal and nonpersonal data. At the heart of this Article is an inquiry into the expansion of dated notions of cybersecurity law.\nPresently, cybersecurity law’s narrow approach seeks to remedy materialized harms such as identity theft or fraud. This approach contravenes the purpose of cybersecurity law—to create legal norms protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer systems and networks. If cybersecurity law seeks to protect individuals from the externalities of certain cyber risks, it needs to recognize emerging threats targeting computer systems and networks, and subsequently, individual autonomy, privacy, and democracy."

As health becomes ever more entangled with digital technologies, a growing ecology of digital health services promise greater individual autonomy to learn about and managing medical conditions, as well as accessing health services and engaging in forms of self-care. Cautioning against optimist visions of digital health and their promise of empowerment and autonomy, the article explores how health activisms on social media are reclaiming visions of healthcare that move beyond individual and depoliticised models of health technologies. The notion of cosmopolitics is employed to conceptualise relations between technology and health that implicate human and non-human interests in entanglements between health, morality and technology."

These objects can be physical and virtual devices, sensors or actuators, are autonomous and have their own intelligence characteristics. On the other hand, smart environments are those in which sensors and actuators have been integrated, to react to events and to adapt to those present. The environment acquires intelligence through its intelligent components, or through the intelligence resulting from its interaction with other components. Our contribution is a proposal of Cognitive IoT (CIoT) devices structure by adding an agent layer to the device.

I first unpack the mainstream, autonomy‐centric discourse of privacy, and then present a research model that illustrates a possible new theorization of the relationship between self‐identity and information privacy. An empirical study with Facebook users confirms the main hypotheses. In particular, the data show that the need for self‐identity is positively related to privacy management behaviors, which in turn result in increased self‐disclosure in online social networks. I subsequently argue that the so‐called “privacy paradox” is not a paradox per se in the context of online social networking; rather, privacy concerns reflect the ideology of an autonomous self, whereas social construction of self‐identity explains voluntary self‐disclosure."

Although, gaming may offer a simple and straightforward means of alleviating distress, relying on gaming to address one’s unmet psychological needs could invite problematic usage. Self-determination theory highlights the significance of three universally inherent psychological needs for relatedness, competency, and autonomy. A motivation to engage in gaming may be to address unmet needs and may become problematic.This study aimed to assess whether experienced levels of loneliness, depression and self-esteem mediate the association between Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) behaviours and Need-Fulfilment deficits.The participants comprised of 149 adults (83 males, 66 females), aged between 18 and 62 years. A series of self-reported questionaries assessing their levels of IGD behaviours, depression, loneliness, self-esteem and need-fulfilment were completed.Need-fulfilment deficits were linked to higher IGD behaviours. Interestingly, this association was mediated by the reported levels of self-esteem and depression and not loneliness.The findings lend further empirical support for the mediating role of psychological distress between need fulfilment deficits and IGD behaviours."

Yacoub \nThis article explores the dignity of consensual sex-workers through multiple prisms, namely: comparative law, philosophy, and Abrahamic religions. A deontological multidisciplinary approach becomes indispensable for discussing a multi-faceted phenomenon such as sex-work.\nIn discussing the legal aspect of the sex workers’ dignity, this article analyzes two notable Supreme Court decisions that focus on the human dignity issues associated with sex work: Bedford decision of the Canadian Supreme Court and Jordan decision of the Supreme Court of South Africa.\nFurther, this paper examines the sex workers’ case, philosophically, in light of Malby’s working model of human dignity. It adopts Malby’s model to assess the dignity of sex workers through examining sex-workers’ autonomy in their relationships with clients, pimps, brothels, and authorities.\nThis research also provides an overview of the human dignity of sex-workers in Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.\nFinally, it compares sex work to same sex marriage and dwarf tossing as types of victimless crimes to emphasize the leading role of human dignity in carrying out ethical transformation.\nThis article is restricted to consensual sex work and it draws many information from interviews with sex workers available on YouTube and Social Media. It aims at emphasizing the distinction between the dignity of the profession (sex work) and the dignity of the professionals (sex workers) throughout the multiple prisms. This distinction shows that consensual sex work does not necessarily deprive sex workers of their inherent human dignity and autonomy, and thus does not deprive them of their basic human rights."

Psychology students (N=74) and internet sample respondents (N=1,833) were asked to recollect several choice situations of varying importance from their experience and to name, describe, and evaluate them using a number of self-report measures. Combining qualitative and quantitative data analysis, we devised a series of qualitative indicators of choicework (context and content of choice, emotional attitude to the choice process, satisfaction with choice, mindfulness, autonomy, difficulty, and significance) and compared the choice situations on these parameters. Significant and trivial choices differed on a number of variables (more significant situations were characterized by more complicated and conscious choicework). Choice situations with different thematic content also differed in their subjective importance and other parameters of choicework. The results imply the necessity to consider the scale of significance and the thematic content of situations used in choice studies."

When agents self-determine options from which they choose, for instance, their resource consumption and production, while these choices have a collective systemwide impact, optimal decision-making turns into a combinatorial optimization problem known as NP-hard. In such challenging computational problems, centrally managed (deep) learning systems often require personal data with implications on privacy and citizens’ autonomy. This article envisions an alternative unsupervised and decentralized collective learning approach that preserves privacy, autonomy, and participation of multi-agent systems self-organized into a hierarchical tree structure. Remote interactions orchestrate a highly efficient process for decentralized collective learning . This disruptive concept is realized by I-EPOS, the Iterative Economic Planning and Optimized Selections , accompanied by a paradigmatic software artifact. Strikingly, I-EPOS outperforms related algorithms that involve non-local brute-force operations or exchange full information. This article contributes new experimental findings about the influence of network topology and planning on learning efficiency as well as findings on techno-socio-economic tradeoffs and global optimality. Experimental evaluation with real-world data from energy and bike sharing pilots demonstrates the grand potential of collective learning to design ethically and socially responsible participatory sharing economies."

Design/methodology/approach A case study was carried out through participant observation, using the techniques of ethnography, in addition to in-depth interviews and access to secondary data. Follow-up was carried out over two years and six months with two CSA initiatives. Findings The results indicated that the analyzed CSA activities address, in an integrated way, the social, environmental and economic dimensions of sustainability by promoting healthy diet, sustainable agriculture and social transformation to producers and consumers. Producers have their sales guaranteed due to previous consumers’ association; they also receive higher incomes, avoiding the rural exodus. In addition, their work conditions do not harm their health and the diversified production meets the consumption of their family group, increasing farmers’ autonomy. Regarding consumers, there is a strong emphasis on education for sustainability. It occurs primarily through face-to-face contact among participants, at times of basket withdrawal, follow-up visits to production and interaction events at farmers’ place. Exchanges of information, recipes, cooking classes, newsletters and internet interactions are also important. As these outputs, verified in a real situation, integrate the mission and the business proposal of these CSAs initiatives, it is possible to conclude that, in these analyzed situations, sustainability is incorporated into a business strategy. Sustainability is a structural component of the strategy, with practices in different levels of the business activity. Research limitations/implications As an exploratory study, the findings cannot be extrapolated to broader populations. To improve generalization, it would be beneficial to broaden the sample and pursue comparative research between countries and regions. Also, studies should examine which incentive structures and programs would relate more to better outcomes in education for sustainability and behavior chances. Practical implications From a managerial point of view, this study contributes by presenting emerging businesses in Brazil, which incorporated sustainability in their strategy, contributing with the need pointed out by Robinson (2004) to provide innovative and creative solutions toward sustainability. It also presents some alternatives to achieve objectives of the 2030 Agenda, especially objective 2 (related to food security) and 12 (improve sustainable production and consumption systems). This study also contributes by elucidating alternatives to promote education for sustainable consumption, presenting cases where consumers reported a more sustainable behavior. Originality/value This study contributes to the literature by filling the gap pointed out by Arzu and Erkan (2010), Nakamba, Chan and Sharmina (2017), Rossi et al. (2017) and Searcy (2016) about addressing all three dimensions of sustainability in an integrated way, by analyzing CSA initiatives (a need indicated by Brown and Miller, 2008), especially evaluating empirical cases of sustainability insertion in the business strategy, as proposed by Claro, Claro and Amâncio (2008) and Franceschelli, Santoro and Candelo (2018). This study also responded to the need pointed out by Benites Lázaro and Gremaud (2016) to further understand the insertion of sustainability in the context of Latin America."

ACPS have the ability to integrate new `mutagenic’ technologies, i.e., technologies able to cause mutations in the society. Emerging approaches, such as artificial intelligence techniques and deep learning, enable exponential speedups for supporting increasingly higher levels of autonomy and self-adaptation. In spite of this disruptive landscape, however, deployment and broader adoption of ACPS in safety-critical scenarios remains challenging. In this paper, we address some challenges that are stretching the limits of ACPS safety engineering, including tightly related aspects such as ethics and resilience. We argue that a paradigm change is needed that includes the entire socio-technical aspects, including trustworthiness, responsibility, liability, as well as the ACPS ability to learn from past events, anticipate long-term threads and recover from unexpected behaviors."

This paper fills this important gap by using self-determination theory (SDT) to analyze how the use of social media for work purposes is associated with government employees’ need satisfaction and intrinsic work motivation. According to regression results, employees’ use of social media is positively related to employees’ need satisfaction (autonomy, relatedness, and competence) and, accordingly, intrinsic work motivation. However, further analysis shows that too much use of social media has an averse effect. Theoretically, this study is one of the pioneer attempts to integrate e-governance with SDT. Practically, we encourage managers to use caution in promoting the use of social media for work purposes. Using social media two to three days a week may be the ideal range."

Romera \n Rosario Ortega-Ruiz \n Rosario Del Rey \nLiterature points out the role of parenting on adolescent cyberbullying involvement. However, it is necessary to clarify how gender affects this relationship. The aim of this study has been to examine the relation between the adolescents’ perception about parenting practices, and their involvement in cyberbullying, bearing in mind both girls’ and boys’ gender and progenitors’ gender. The sample comprised 2060 Spanish secondary school students (47.9% girls; Mage = 14.34). Two-way ANOVA and binary logistic regression analyses were carried out. An effect of the interaction between sex and cyberbullying roles in maternal affection and communication, inductive discipline, and psychological control, as well as paternal promotion of autonomy and psychological control, was found. In general, it can be observed that the more negative results were found in cyber-aggressors, especially when this role is assumed by girls. The results of logistic regression analysis suggest that parenting practices explain better cyberbullying involvement in girls compared to boys, finding some important differences between both sexes regarding protective and risk factors. These findings highlight the importance of parenting practices to explain cyberbullying involvement, which supports the necessity of including family among the addresses of intervention programs."

A conventional choice that comes from below, shared by the families of any social status, from the south or the north, young or less young and which we could define as ethical-pragmatic, answers two questions: the first, of a moral character, reflects the idea that children under the age of 11 have not yet acquired the cognitive tools to manage this new technological object and its consequences in “social” life; the second, more practical, believes that the phone can be useful for kids 11 years and older who will start going to school alone. But how will the life of the eleven years change with the arrival of the mobile phone? What will happen in their universe will be a small Copernican revolution, they will discover the possibility of always being connected, they will feel the need to be in a group, in a network, suffer exclusion or disinterest, they will be tempted to destroy the sense of boredom with any online game. Through a telephone, their first form of private property, will claim the right to privacy (block codes or even worse fingerprints), will experience the first forms of autonomy. In short, they will experience adult life."

Professional development forms are ordered according to their reducing degree in meaning for respondents by a ranking method. It was determined that the first three ranked places among the named types and forms of university lecturers professional development took such activities as studying at trainings, courses, coaching sessions outside the native educational institution; using online forms and self-analysing of own professional experience accordingly. Nationwide advanced training courses and a system of professional development within native higher education institutions are highly demanded among lecturers, although are clearly underdeveloped forms.  According to the results of the study, it is suggested to cultivate types of professional growth of the academic stuff of higher education institutions at the expense of accredited educational programs in educational or scientific institutions; expanding of educational online resources of a Ukrainian Internet segment, as well as involvement of European and worldwide relevant resources. It is also perspective to develop the lecturers training system in the context of institutional autonomy as this is an all-European trend."

Objectives We aimed to investigate the influence of social networks on the three main factors of the self-determination theory in learners. Methods: The present case-control study with a pretest-posttest design was conducted among 40 Iranian Ph.D. students who lived in Schengen area countries. Students were randomly divided into control (n = 20) and experimental (n = 20) groups. Before and after holding training sessions through a social media (Facebook) and face to face (FTF) education, Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and the intrinsic motivation inventory were used for data collection. The intrinsic motivation inventory is a valid instrument that evaluates the three factors of autonomy, competence and relatedness. Results: the results indicated a significant difference between the two groups in terms of the three factors. The means of all the three variables improved significantly in the social network group as compared to the FTF group (P = 0.00). Although competence had improved in both groups, this improvement was greater in the social media group relative to the FTF group (P = 0.00). Conclusions: Social networks provide better learning experiences. They improve learning outcomes as they boost learners’ relatedness, competence and autonomy."

Brichacek \n James T. Neill \n Kristen Murray \nExposure to ideal body types in the media has been consistently linked to reduced body satisfaction. Images posted on social networking sites may also impact body satisfaction by portraying idealised standards of physical attractiveness promoted by peers. This study draws on self-determination theory to examine whether satisfaction of basic psychological needs (autonomy, competence, and relatedness) protects against the negative effect of viewing Facebook images depicting an ideal body type on body satisfaction. Female (n = 141) and male (n = 48) university students were randomly assigned to view either a body-ideal image or a travel image presented on a mock Facebook profile. Viewing body-ideal imagery resulted in significantly lower body satisfaction compared to viewing travel imagery (d = -0.37). Satisfaction of the needs for autonomy and competence predicted higher baseline body satisfaction; however, none of the psychological needs protected against the negative effect of viewing body-ideal imagery on body satisfaction. Limitations included brief exposure to a single Facebook image and use of a convenience sample. Future research may benefit from measuring body image-specific rather than general psychological need satisfaction to predict state changes in body satisfaction."

Five job characteristics (skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy and feedback) and five OCB behaviors (altruism, civic virtue, courtesy, conscientiousness, and sportsmanship) were studied. The overall job satisfaction was measured with seven general items adopted from Al-Damour and Awamleh (2002). Data were collected voluntarily using social media network announcements and pencil and paper. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis was used in testing this moderation relationship.,Results showed that job satisfaction plays a significant moderating effect in enhancing the relationship between four out of the five job characteristics (feedback, skill variety, task identity and autonomy) and only two out of five OCB behaviors, namely, altruism and courtesy. Also, culture showed no significant impact on results.,Using a self-reporting tool, the respondents could give biased responses that might influence results. In addition, the use a complex relationship to establish a causality relationship among many variables measured with many items did make it difficult and sometimes errored out using SEM analysis.,This study delivers important suggestions to the management of these institutions as well as higher education administration about how to enhance their educators’ OCBs as a source of competitive advantage taking into consideration that expatriates work within certain legal and social contexts.,With very limited related research covering this region, this study provides an insight into how educators’ OCBs can be enhanced within unique employment structures and policies designed for expatriate educators in the GCC countries."

The subjects of the study were students of a private Senior High School in South Tangerang. As for the methodology, this research applied quantitative and qualitative design. Quantitative elements include questionnaires as the data collecting method, while qualitative elements used semi structured interviews. In this interview, five students were chosen purposively based on students responses on the questionnaires. The findings of this study indicate that the use of technology to learn English outside the classroom has encouraged the development of learner autonomy which includes aspects of learning motivation, metacognitive awareness, self-confidence and social skills. This research is expected to help English teachers improve their students’ English proficiency with the concern on the development of learner autonomy by using various information and communication technology.DOI:doi.org/10.24071/llt.2018.210203"

The hugely popular digital media platform YouTube has become one means by which people share their experiences of healthcare. In this paper, we examine amateur YouTube videos featuring people receiving Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. DBS has become a widely implemented treatment, and it is surrounded by high expectations that can create difficulty for clinicians, patients and their families. We examine how DBS, Parkinson’s disease, and DBS recipients themselves, are delineated within these YouTube videos. The videos, we demonstrate, contain common compositional and stylistic elements that collectively represent DBS as a technological fix, and which accentuate the autonomy of the DBS recipient. The relational, interpersonal dimensions of chronic illness, and the complex impact of DBS on family dynamics, are elided. We therefore shed light on the means by which high expectations regarding DBS are sustained and circulated, and more generally, we illustrate how potentially powerful representations of medical technologies can emerge from the intersection of social media platforms, afflicted bodies and patient narratives."

For this purpose, we thoroughly investigate complex network theory and modeling methods for WoC with cyber–physical–social systems (CPSS). WoC is a new intelligent dispatching framework characterized by weak centralization, self-organization coupling, high independence, efficient coordination, and autonomous learning. Based on these characteristics and actual engineering demands, in this paper, we adopt complex network theory, parallel machine learning, and multi-agent stochastic game theory to address three basic scientific issues in WoC dispatching and control: how to build a complex network model for WoC with CPSS to stimulate new knowledge emergence; how to analyze the evolution structure stability and operation stability during this knowledge emergence process; and how to use the emerged new knowledge to achieve cell autonomy and system-wide coordination based on independent and CID, respectively. Finally, we conduct some explorations and make a prospect for WoC. The biggest innovation of this paper lies in thoroughly investigating how to fully stimulate and utilize new knowledge emergence from WoC to greatly improve its CID level of dispatching and control. This will be of great significance to the development of new-generation power system smart dispatching in the future."

This Article discusses the ramifications of such coverage on other diversity policies and employee benefits, as well as with respect to class and racial inequality, and gender-normative societal roles.Egg freezing is an elective procedure to preserve a woman’s eggs by extracting, freezing and storing them until she is ready to get pregnant at a later point in time. Similar to how the Pill allowed women to defer pregnancy and invest in their careers in the 1970s, some see egg freezing as the ultimate breakthrough to level the playing field for women so that they can have both a career and motherhood. However, when an employer subsidizes that choice, and does so over other employee benefits such as paid parental leave, childcare or flexible work arrangements, the employer reinforces the dominant—yet as this Article shows, flawed—view that motherhood is incompatible with work.Indeed, our society was founded on notions of individual rights and autonomy, and egg freezing benefits claim to provide a woman with the choice to put her eggs on ice as she focuses on her career, financial stability, and finding a partner. This Article demonstrates that while potentially beneficial in the short term to recruit women and diversify the workplace, egg freezing coverage is more likely to aggravate class and racial inequality and disrupt the movements for supportive employee benefits and a restructuring of the societal norms of gender roles. With movements such as Time’s Up and #MeToo rallying women and men around the world, it is time to bring to light and question notions of traditional gender roles that companies may in effect be reinforcing."

Calvo \nAbstract The benefit of reviewing personal feedback to students’ learning of clinical communication skills is well researched. Less is known about the factors that related to students’ engagement in reviewing non-compulsory online feedback, and ways to motivate their behavioural engagement. In this paper, we reported two studies in which medical students completed assessed clinical video conferencing consultations with human simulated patients via an online training platform that also provided automated and human feedback for students. In Study 1, three days after the consultation, an email with different instructional styles (autonomy-supportive, controlling or control) was sent to different groups reminding students to review their feedback. In Study 2, up to three repetitions of the same, either autonomy-supportive or controlling, emails were sent to students. Results of Study 1 revealed that students who reviewed feedback before receiving emails achieved higher assessment results and reported higher degree of autonomy to participate in the training program than the remaining students. However, the different instructional styles of the single email in this study did not significantly influence the students’ engagement differently. Study 2 results revealed that students who received controlling emails displayed higher engagement than students who received autonomy-supportive emails. Findings suggested that multiple factors might influence students’ engagement in reviewing their online feedback, and this study provided evidences of the effects of using emails to motivate students to review the feedback."
