<p>Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of this paper is to lay out an approach to addressing the problem of privacy protection in the global digital environment based on the importance that information has to improve users’ informational self-determination. Following this reasoning, this paper focuses on the suitable way to provide user with the correct amount of information they may need to maintain a desirable grade of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> as far as their privacy protection is concerned and decide whether or not to put their personal data on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach</p>
<p>The authors arrive at this point in their analysis by qualitative discourse analysis of the most relevant scientific papers and dossiers relating to privacy protection.</p>
<p>Findings</p>
<p>The goal of this paper is twofold. The first is to illustrate the importance of privacy by default and informed consent working together to protect <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) users’ privacy. The second goal is to develop a suitable way to administrate the mentioned “informed consent” to users.</p>
<p>Originality/value</p>
<p>To fulfil this purpose, the authors present a new concept of informed consent: active “informed consent” or “Opt-in” model by layers. “Opt-in” regimens have already been used with cookies but never with 2.0 applications, as, for instance, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social network site</span>s (SNS).</p>

<p><span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> in learning is about people taking more control over their learning in the classrooms, the purpose of learn languages and the ways in which they learn them. In this way, technology helps much in learning a language. This paper explores the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> as more than preference or strategy by the learner; it must be supported in a systematic way by the teacher and the curriculum for the learner to benefit. The characteristics of successful autonomous learner are explained followed by some examples that shown that learners have in common are that their attitudes were developed after they made their own decision for themselves that exclusively studying in the classroom environment was not enough. The paper also emphasis on technology approaches in developing learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, especially by using the computer and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>. Newer technology, particularly the latest online systems, however, allows sound, movement, interactivity (for exercises, demonstrations, online discussion, etc), and the incorporation of genuine material for learning.

<p>ABSTRACTFrom the beginning of the computer age in 1936, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) has been a force for good. Business capacities were increased. Networks allowed the multinational enterprise to operate globally. The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> improved scientific collaboration, fueled e-commerce, and connected seven billion persons around the world with Massive Online Open Courses (MOOC) and gaming. But there is a dark side to ICT. Employment is destroyed. Artificial intelligence (AI) is replacing humans in white collar jobs and being deployed in warfare. The “Dark Web” is facilitating criminal syndicates and terrorism. Privacy and individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> has been lost forever. An accelerating <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> arms race threatens transportation, finance, electricity, and communication infrastructures. Further growth of ICT will not stop. We will see both good and bad consequences downstream.</p>

<p>Background A living will allows patients to express their own wishes for treatment in advance and make them legally mandatory for physicians’ as well as relatives’ care. Conceptions of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, vulnerability, responsibility, and care as well as corresponding personal experiences build the background of such anticipative decision-making. &nbsp;Aim From May 2015 on the project, as a part of the interdisciplinary Bavarian research group ForGenderCare, will study the role of gender-specific beliefs and perceptions of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, responsibility and vulnerability in anticipative decision-making in the final phase of life. Taking the German debate about living wills as an example, the project aims at exposing and comparing patterns of argumentation in the medico-ethical professional literature, advice literature and the media, among professional advisors and the population in Bavaria. The poster will present the project outline including hypotheses and preliminary results. Methods Debates on living wills take place at different levels. Therefore, platform-adapted methodologies have to be developed including desk analysis, qualitative interviews with professionals, group discussions with families, standardised content analyses of mass media, and qualitative content analyses of relevant online platforms. Relevance and practical aim The project will develop personalised counselling-models for planning living wills. Discussion As human existence oscillates between <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and dependence, we analyse four public and private areas that contribute to the current discussions in different ways: a) within the academia, b) in hospitals, c) in families, d) in mass media and also in specialised <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> platforms. This holistic approach allows a deeper understanding of the debates on living wills in times of medicalization of life.</p>

<p>If we had an ideal healthcare system, how would we know that it was ideal? Nothing pleases everyone. No one lives forever. No person is perfect; nor would a reformed healthcare system be perfect. What is as good as we can reasonably expect? During an earlier phase of this long debate, I determined that there were 11 key elements to use to judge a health system and that they could be equally weighted on a 1- to 9-point scale, with 9 points at the top.[1] So, a nearly perfect system would total 11 times 9, or 99. The 11 characteristics were the following: Does the health system provide access for all to basic care? Does it produce real cost control? Does it promote continuing quality, reduce administrative hassle and cost, enhance disease prevention, encourage primary care, consider long-term care, retain necessary patient and physician <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, limit professional liability, and possess staying power? Some 10 years ago when I graded the various reforms then being proposed, the US system graded at 55; the Clinton Plan graded at 70; the Stark Congressional markup of it got the top score at 72; the Republican leadership plan graded at 47.[2] Of course, no organized reform occurred and things just got worse. I grade the 2005 American system at 52. I give the “Medicare for All” plan that I recently suggested a grade of 73 and the “Kaiser Permanente America” concoction a 76.[3] Next time, my proposed reforms. That’s my opinion.

<p>In many countries, anxious adults and young people are increasingly searching the web for information about their health or ill health and that of their family. This activity often increases their anxiety and confusion. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span>chondria refers to the resulting match with real or imagined symptoms, and may lead to unnecessary medical consultation. Advantages of online searching include knowledge, empowerment, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and self-responsibility. Disadvantages are increased fears and possible misinformation and misdiagnosis and inappropriate self-treatment. There is also loss of placebo-style trust in, and concordance with, professionals, who may experience reduced confidence, authority and effectiveness. However, a new and more collaborative style of consultation has developed, with the practitioner confirming or refuting information rather than protecting it.</p>

<p>The increasing use of ICT devices, such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s and tablets, needs development of properly software or apps to facilitate socio-educative life of citizens in smart cities: Adaptive educational resources, leisure and entertainment facilities or mobile payment services, among others. Undoubtedly, all that is opening a new age with more information and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for each individual, but the point is if these apps are accessible for the whole population. And when we talk about accessibility in an App, we are not only considering if the user is able to switch it on or unfold it main menu, we consider interface aspects that can present difficulties for some users. This study analyzes accessibility and usability of 15 Apps for people with visual dysfunction, because this difficulty has the greatest influence on the effective and efficient use of them. Data are collected through a descriptive scale made by a deductive-inductive process on four categories with a wide use of Apps. Social and specifically social-networking category is the largest consider accessibility on their apps, being highly demand by users and cost-effective for companies. Other categories are evaluated as completely inaccessible by users.</p>

<p>Empowerment is a multi-dimensional process which should enable women or group of women to realise their full identity and power in all spheres of life. It consists of greater access to knowledge and resources, greater <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in decision-making to enable them to have greater ability to plan their lives or to have greater control over the circumstances that influence their lives and free from shocks imposed on them by custom, belief and practice. The status of the women is connected with their economic position or status which depends on their participation in economic activities such as ability to access credit, role in decision-making in financial matters and others. Social or domestic empowerment is a gradual process. Some variables had been selected to assess the impact of social empowerment among the informants in this paper, for example independent movement, expression of own view, undertaking decisions in familial matters, interaction with public bodies, participation in protest against social crimes and so on. The present qualitative has been conducted in the villages Amlani and Takipur of North 24 Parganas, West Bengal. The study is based on typical anthropological methodology under the domain of ethnographic approach. The contextual data have been collected through participant observations, intensive interviews and case studies. The data from books, journals, magazines and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> websites have also been utilised.</p>

<p>With the advancement of technology, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> it has become the primary means for audiovisual consumption while presenting a critical situation around the debate the quality of the content. With the emergence of DTT (Digital Terrestrial Television) in Spain television networks, public and private, they have created new thematics channels focused on content for children. At the same time, with the rise of new electronic devices such as tablets and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s, they have moved such content to the network by creating of platforms whose programs are aimed childhood. The non-linearity and immediacy in consumption make the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> becomes an active mean giving <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and freedom to access a multitude of content regardless of time and the device. In this situation the child consumers is the audience that worries both parents and educational institutions. Restless, therefore, that children do not find programs adjusted to their age. The quality concept harbors no concrete definition because of the multitude of factors and perspectives that influence it. This paper, and based on different measurement criteria set by countries like Argentina, Chile, Spain, France, Italy, Japan, Sweden, the University of Pennsylvania (USA) or the ACTF (Australian Children´s Television Foundation) poses as main objective to analyze the online platforms Clan RTVE, Neox Kidz and Boing of television TVE, Antena 3 and Telecinco, respectively, because they are considered spaces with audiovisual material created for children. With the intention of demonstrating that they are presented as quality environments for children who access them it will conduct a qualitative methodology. Using the content analysis technique to each of the animated titles we can say that the cartoons, as outlined above, are quality entertainment programs.</p>

<p>The article focuses on the process of othering as it is embodied in linguistic interactions among Brazilians on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> during the last decade, when socioeconomic mobility expanded the access and the adherence to practices involving digital technological resources by different social Brazilian groups. By othering, it means any linguistic-discursive action by which an individual or group is classified as “not one of us” (difference and strangeness). Considering that the construction of the Other is made up of social action; has an ideological component; and that an exercise of power is always present, the aim herewith is to show that othering processes in focused interactions instantiate overlaps, interceptions and &nbsp;tangencies between different space-temporal scales which constitute the contemporary Brazilian “reality”. Observational data from a research project carried out since 2005 about <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>-mediated interactions among Brazilians will be used to illustrate the contentions put forth in this paper.

<p>With the development of computer and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> technology, web-based autonomous learning is increasingly becoming an essential element in the learning process for college students. Web-based autonomous learning, based on humanism and constructivism, has combined autonomous learning and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> technology, and opened up a new path to college English learning. Mastering English is even more important for engineering students whose native language is not English, as many engineering graduates encounter difficulties in their English-related work. Most scientific papers or journals globally are written in English. Most engineering graphs are also marked in English. To prepare engineering students for their future careers and life-long study, research is conducted in this paper to investigate the current situation of web-based autonomous English learning of engineering students in particular and current problems in their process of learning. Based on research findings, possible solutions and suggestions are proposed to solve the problems and improve students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in English learning.</p>

<p>We report on a study on the ways leading teachers in secondary schools use <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networks while interacting with their students. We undertook in-depth interviews with five leading teachers, and analyzed logs of interactions in order to identify teaching practices combining social networks. One teacher considerably strengthened her traditional teaching practices to control students according to a pedagogical approach of transmission of knowledge. We found that four teachers fostered social learning, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and active engagement among their students. They thereby fostered the constitution of a learning community - of inquiry, or a moral community, through the use of social network site</span>s. Additionally, we identified the distinctive role of social networks in contributing to the students’ learning to be part of their community. We examined five Israeli leading teachers who use social networks in their classes.Four teachers were found to foster social learning, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and active learning.The fifth teacher used FB to strengthen traditional teaching practices.SNSs help students learning to be members of communities for better or for worse.With SNSs, leading teachers become potential agents of educational change.</p>

<p>Recent studies on digital social networks have analyzed their role as part of collective action and their use during electoral campaigns. Based on a study of the Chilean student movement during the 2013 electoral campaign in that country, the article offers an analysis of how <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> is used by the three student federations that make up the movement. The results suggest informative and organizational aspects take priority in the use of social networks in that context. This trend is mediated by the peculiarities of the movement – the presence of traditional student organizations – and by and the complexity of the relationship with institutional policy, particularly the defense of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> against the risks of cooptation, increased by the passage of former leaders of the movement to the latter. The inclination for these spaces to be used more and more at times of increased social mobilization is confirmed, and the tensions between their use by organized collective action (student federations) and by the individuals participating in that action are shown.DOI: 10.5294/pacla.2016.19.3.6</p>

<p>This article recalls the main steps of a « psychotherapy by virtual » of a young psychotic teenager. In this article, we will see how the use of a computer game proves to be a vector of a first transference address from the psychotic to the clinician. Therefore, the virtual will be studied through the magnifying glass of the pathology, revealing a function of « emergence » specific to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netics. This function is triple. Firstly, this contingency loads the emergence promises, allowing the user to expect from the machine anything but, and much more than, it is able to deliver. Secondly, this emergence gives the machine the appearance of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, which helps the patient to delude himself into not considering himself as the origin of his representations. Lastly, this generator of representations enables the symptom by giving it a form, thus processing what Freud called a « force of healing drive » preparing the way for a transference relation.</p>

<p>Web-based conversational learning provides an opportunity for shared knowledge base creation through collaboration and collective wisdom extraction. Usually, the amount of generated information in such forums is very huge, multidimensional (in alignment with the desirable preconditions for constructivist knowledge creation), and sometimes, the nature of expected new information may not be anticipated in advance. Thus, concept maps (crafted from constructed data) as summary tools may be a solution to improve critical thinking and learning by making connections between the facts or knowledge shared by the participants during online discussion This exploratory paper begins with the description of this innovation tried on a web-based interacting platform (<span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> list management software), FAIMER-Listserv, and generated qualitative evidence through peer-feedback. This process description is further supported by a theoretical construct which shows how social constructivism (inclusive of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and complexity) affects the conversational learning. The paper rationalizes the use of concept map as mid-summary tool for extracting information and further sense making out of this apparent intricacy.</p>

<p>This study involving 252 students from four different higher educational institutions in China investigates the attitudes and practices towards learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> with the use of technology in learning English. Questionnaires were distributed to the 252 participants and follow-up in-depth interviews were undertaken with a number of participants. Meanwhile, the teacher as a researcher conducted the action research project in order to understand how the use of modern technology and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> enhanced English proficiency of learners, especially their listening and speaking abilities. Additionally, some invaluable data were collected from interviews with participants and learning diaries on their experiences in using advanced technology. The research results demonstrate that: 1) One of the most important roles for language teachers is to motivate students to learn English, and to teach them correct learning strategies and learning methods; 2) Learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> plays a crucial role in learning English; 3) The combination of the use of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and advanced technology, such as computers and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, helps learners improve their English language proficiency, and is considered to be one of the most effective ways to learn a language. Finally, this paper concludes with some implications and suggestions on English language teaching and learning by the use of the new media.</p>

<p>Work overload or work pressure may undermine workers’ intrinsic motivation. In the present research, we tested the conditions under which this may (not) occur, including the perceived opportunity to blend on-site and off-site working through the effective use of computers and modern <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y. Our sample consisted of 657 workers (51% female) representing a variety of industries. As hypothesized, it is not high job demands per se, but high demands in combination with a high need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and a lack of perceived opportunities for blended working that undermines intrinsic work motivation. When workers high in need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> perceived opportunities for blended working, their intrinsic work motivation was not negatively affected by increasing job demands. This main finding suggests that, particularly for workers high in need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, the perceived opportunity for blended working is an effective, contemporary resource to cope with the increasing job demands typically observed in today’s workplace. Theoretically, these findings contribute to the refinement and extension of influential demands-resource models and Person-Job Fit theory. Practically, our findings may show managers how to effectively keep workers intrinsically motivated and productive in their jobs when job demands are high. We tested conditions under which high job demands may undermine work motivation.We examined the new concept of perceived opportunity for blended working.Blended working, enabled through ICTs, works when need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is high.High job demands per se do not undermine intrinsic work motivation.We emphasize the importance of fit between work context and workers’ needs.</p>

<p>Corporate reputation is affected by the growing impact of online reputation, because of the weight of peer recommendations in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>.

Their role in relation to corporate reputation has barely been recognized.

We take a qualitative methodology as the basic strategy to approach the knowledge of the public and the stakeholders. We carry out a critical theoretical review based on secondary sources.</p>

<p>ABSTRACTThe motivation of user-generated content (UGC) is a vital issue for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> providers. This study investigates this issue using the self-determination theory (SDT). The SDT identifies three fundamental human psychological needs, namely the need for competence, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and relatedness. This study aims to answer the question of how the satisfaction of these needs motivates users to produce UGC and utilizes the multi-study model comparison approach. Two survey studies were conducted in China and the United States. The partial least squares (PLS) analyses confirmed that the SDT indeed explained UGC motivation significantly and that trust beliefs support people’s need for relatedness. Post hoc analyses showed that there were significant differences between Chinese and American culture. Those results make important contributions to theory and practice. For example, practitioners need to motivate users to produce UGC by supporting their psychological needs. Besides, different trust beliefs should …</p>

<p>Abstract For the consolidation and improvement of a companies market position it is necessary to master the increased complexity of production processes with suitable methods. This paper will examine whether and how far autonomous production processes are suitable to master the complexity of production processes. The paper starts with an introduction of the problem definition followed by an explanation of theoretical foundations of complexity in production, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-physical production systems. In addition, selected already existing methods to master complexity are presented. The second part of the paper starts with an introduction into measuring the degree of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in production processes which is the basis for the following simulation-based analysis. Afterwards, the simulation environment is presented. The third chapter is about the experimental analysis of the presented research question. Therefor, the experimental set up and the implementation are presented. The paper ends with an outlook on further evaluation activities.</p>

<p>ABSTRACT<span style="background-color:lightgreen">Smartphone</span>s and other mobile communication devices are promoted with promises of enhancing professional competence and individual freedom in working life, and in work–life balance. However, an emerging stream of research demonstrates that the adoption of such technologies is accompanied by increasing stress, collective control and work intensification. This article provides a discussion of recent research on the effects of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> usage in contemporary organizational life. Generally, this research presents a contradiction between, on the one hand, the discourse on technologies as a means to enhance individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and competence and, on the other hand, the de facto incorporation of technology users in networks of control and an unhealthy work culture of permanent connectivity. Finding inspiration in the work of Slavoj Žižek and his development of psychoanalytical concepts, this article offers an alternative approach to this issue. It does so by reconsidering how to understand employee subje…</p>

<p>In Europe, most individuals die in hospitals or other health care institutions, where nurses care for them at the end of their lives. Despite the nurses’ important role in end-of-life care, their perceptions of death are underrepresented in the literature. This study explores Finnish nurses’ varied conceptions of a good death with a qualitative design. Nurses (n = 82), recruited via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, completed a Web-based questionnaire about a good death. Data were collected in April 2014 and analyzed inductively with a phenomenographic, 7-step analysis method. The <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and human dignity of the dying person were highlighted in the study results as key features of a good death. Four categories of description emerged from the data: respect of one’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and human dignity, attributes of a good death, preparation for death, and contextual aspects of a good death. The findings demonstrate the broad variation in nurses’ conceptions of a good death. Nurses will be better able to provide individualized and high-quality end-of-life care with knowledge about the various existing conceptions of a good death. Future research should explore the extent to which nurses’ conceptions of a good death are realized during provision of end-of-life care by nurses in different health care settings.</p>

<p>The first two years of the Xi Jinping administration saw a thorough reconfiguration of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> governance. This reconfiguration created a centralized and integrated institutional framework for information technologies, in support of an ambitious agenda to place digital technologies at the heart of propaganda, public opinion and social control work. Conversely, the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and spontaneity of China’s online sphere was vastly reduced, as the leadership closed channels for public deliberation. This article reviews the institutional and regulatory changes that have taken place between 2012 and 2014, and analyses the methods and purposes of control they imply.</p>

<p>Efforts in quality improvement and development of education in the era of regional <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> are not only the responsibility of the central government and provincial governments, but also the responsibility of local governments. Quality improvement and development of education thus become strategic issues for any local government. This study aims to address issues related to: (1) the condition of school facilities and infrastructure (2) the role of school committees which is not optimal; (3) the absence of equitable distribution of teachers; and (4) the lack of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>y/ICT-based learning application in in secondary schools. The research was conducted in four districts, namely Bangkalan, Sampang, Pamekasan and Sumenep. The main theory employed in this study is the School Based Management (SBM) or the so-called School Based Management (SBM). The population was students, parents and teachers. The total number of samples was 250 people comprising 100 students, 100 parents and 50 teachers. The research data were obtained from primary and secondary data. The study yielded a number of key findings. First, 90% of High School (or its equivalent) teachers master the materials taught. This is due to fact that the materials taught are in accordance with the education qualification of the teacher. Secondly, the mismatch found in Madurese high schools was apparently caused by the lack of educators with suitable qualification for the subjects they teach concurrently. Almost all secondary teachers in Madura island require trainings related to the development of competency for mastering the subject materials. The last but not the least, the majority of teachers still apply simple learning methods. Although the method applied by teachers are generally similar, there are significant differences between the favorite schools and the other schools.</p>

<p>New technologies like large-scale <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> sites (e.g., <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span>) and crowdsourcing services (e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk, Crowdflower, Clickworker) are impacting social science research and providing many new and interesting avenues for research. The use of these new technologies for research has not been without challenges, and a recently published psychological study on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> has led to a widespread discussion of the ethics of conducting large-scale experiments online. Surprisingly little has been said about the ethics of conducting research using commercial crowdsourcing marketplaces. In this article, I focus on the question of which ethical questions are raised by data collection with crowdsourcing tools. I briefly draw on the implications of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> research more generally, and then focus on the specific challenges that research with crowdsourcing tools faces. I identify fair pay and the related issue of respect for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, as well as problems with the power dynamic between researcher and participant, which has implications for withdrawal without prejudice, as the major ethical challenges of crowdsourced data. Furthermore, I wish to draw attention to how we can develop a “best practice” for researchers using crowdsourcing tools.</p>

<p>During the last decade, the development of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies (ICT) has led the world into a new era of innovative technologies that can provide effective responses to human concerns. In developed countries, the profitability motivation has imposed Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) in enterprises as a better way to design information systems capable of taking into account inter-organizational cooperation mechanisms while preserving <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the latter. Those Service-Oriented Architectures did not stop at the doors of public administrations. Thus, several specifications have been made to adapt them to the peculiarities of public governance. But these models are not always able to respond effectively to the concerns of governments in developing countries particularly when they are structurally and territorially decentralized. Therefore, we propose a more suitable model to this type of e-governance. We will later see how our model can be more suitable for the organization of remote and secured fairground courts in Cameroon to address constraints related to finance, time and security that these courts currently impose.</p>

<p>Telecollaboration enables students from different geographical locations to interact in a more authentic environment, share their views with their partners, create profiles as well as build <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>ies enjoying common interests. With this in mind, a Spanish-Finnish task-based project was designed to examine how students perceived their cultural exchange via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> and the extent to which such online interactions assisted them in becoming autonomous learners. Nineteen Spanish and seventeen Finnish participants were provided with the opportunity to interact with each other outside the classroom with a view to exploring the target culture and, consequently, experiencing intercultural learning. The findings suggest that the learning experience was positive and that the participants felt motivated to examine each other’s cultural traits and manage their own learning tasks. Sharing information and reciprocally exchanging views on comments are paramount in developing skills to become independent learners.</p>

<p>The paper analyzes the effects that occur in the process of the educational environment informatization. The following effects were analyzed: information richness, openness, individualization of learning and collaboration. Examples of educational practice, illustrating the significant changes of the university educational environment associated with the manifestation of these effects, are presented. The aim of the pilot study carried out in Herzen University was to identify the attitude to the listed effects of teachers and students who are using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y in the educational interactions. The leading method of study were a series of surveys addressed to teachers and students. Groups of questions were related to basic information effects, manifested in the educational environment of the university. The total number of the survey participants is 200 students (bachelors and masters) and 100 teachers, most actively using electronic environment for research, education and professional activities. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the results showed that information richness, spatial and temporal freedom of educational interactions are demanded by students, but at the same time, the data indicated a lack of systematic pedagogical support for the information and educational activities of students. A large part of students show a high <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the information educational environment, but also demands implementing individualized information and communication educational request. Students and teachers are actively using a variety of information and communication opportunities of the electronic environment, but students’ activeness in the electronic environment is largely determined by the recommendations of teachers, rather than by a free choice of educational opportunities. The participants of the educational environment acquire a significant degree of freedom in relation to the time and place of interaction with educational resources, but evidence suggests that educational activities in the electronic environment is not sufficiently focused on expanding the range of educational opportunities and preparing students for continual self-improvement of knowledge and skills. As the conclusions, we note the need to improve both the corporate strategy of the university electronic environment development and the competences of educational interactions in the extended information and communication space. This will reveal the full potential of e-learning environment and provide greater guarantees for obtaining high-quality educational outcomes. For teachers are in demand special competences, providing the possibility of forming a diverse and adaptive media environment for saturated solution of educational problems in accordance with university policies, introduction of e-learning and global education trends. For students, come to the fore the competences which help to improve their information culture and individual requests for the use of a variety of educational opportunities available in the electronic space. These ideas are fully consistent with the demanded by modern society the lifelong learning strategy.</p>

<p>The present study aimed to clarify EFL learners’ conceptions of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and whether their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> was correlated with their emotional intelligence. The research was carried out with the participation of 110 learners at Distance Education University in Urmia, Iran. Questionnaires were <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>ed to the participants. Results of statistical analyses revealed substantial correlations between learners’ conceptions of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and their emotional intelligence. ‘Independence’, ‘Stress Tolerance’, ‘Problem- Solving’, ‘Happiness’, ‘Self-actualization’, ‘Self-awareness’, ‘Optimism’, ‘Self-regard’, ‘Empathy,’ and ‘Impulse Control’ became the most determining elements of emotional intelligence (EI) for learners. Overall, the findings led the researcher to conclude that learners’ EI is a key factor influencing the extent to which they are ready to learn autonomously, and that teachers could therefore strive to ascertain learners’ intelligence type before they train them to become autonomous.</p>

<p>Spectrum policy in the US (and throughout most of the world) consists generally of a set of nationally determined policies that apply uniformly to all localities. However, it is also true that there is considerable variation in the features (e.g., traffic demand or population density), requirements and constraints of spectrum use on a local basis. Global spectrum policies designed to resolve a situation in New York City could well be overly restrictive for communities in central Wyoming. At the same time, it is necessary to ensure that more permissive policies of central Wyoming would not create problems for NYC (by ensuring, for example, that relocated radios adapt to local policies). Notions of polycentric governance that have been articulated by the late E. Ostrom argue that greater good can be achieved by allowing for local <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in resource allocation. Shared access to spectrum is generally mediated through one of several technologies. As Weiss, Altamimi and Liu show, approaches mediated by geolocation databases are the most cost effective in today’s technology. In the database oriented Spectrum Access System, or SAS, proposed by the FCC, users are granted (renewable) usage rights based on their location for a limited period of time. Because this system grants usage rights on a case-by-case basis, it may also allow for greater local <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> while still maintaining global coordination. For example, it would be technically feasible for the database to include parameters such as transmit power, protocol, and bandwidth. Thus, they may provide the platform by which polycentric governance might come to spectrum management. In this paper, we explore, through some case examples, what polycentric governance of spectrum might look like and how this could be implemented in a database-driven spectrum management system.The technical architecture envisions a geo-located and networked radio that controls the protocols and transmission parameters of the radios associated with it. This appliance (and the associated radios) might be owned and operated by a landlord, a farmer, an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> service provider, etc. The operating parameters of the radios, such as power, bandwidth, protocols (e.g.&nbsp;waiting times in WiFi) would gradually become more permissive until an enforceable event occurred. At this point, the parameters would become more restrictive. Note that this is consistent with the notion of graduated sanctions of the CPR literature.Enforceable events would be resolved between appliances through an automated negotiation protocol. It may also involve fusing authenticated data regarding the enforceable event. If the frequency of enforceable events increased above a threshold, a super local (or regional) coordinating device would be invoked to optimize use of the spectrum. In this way, spectrum governance is nested, providing resilience against a single point of failure in the governance process.This represents a means to learn from the local knowledge and policy changes, which results in a system that is more responsive to environment threats at multiple scales. In the end, we have a system that can compensate for the failure of some units with the successful response of others. This can be an advantage with respect to global policy mechanisms. Thus spectrum management would be best modelled as an emergent phenomenon rather than a top down system. This paper will describe the key details of this system and present some initial modelling results in comparison with the traditional global model of spectrum regulation. It will also address some of the concerns with this approach.</p>

<p>Abstract Classical productions systems are migrating step-by-step into <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-physical production systems. The addition of much more computing power and object-bound data storage will lead to new possibilities for the advancement of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in production systems. Autonomous message exchange and coordination can help to prevent quality problems (for instance wrong pairing of tool and work piece) and improve the disturbance management (for instance by faster information about current and probable disturbances). Due to the fact that nearly all improvements of existing production systems with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-physical systems take place in real and active manufacturing sites, on-site experiments for determining an appropriate degree of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for production objects are not feasible. Therefore, a lab approach is necessary. In this contribution a hybrid lab approach to simulate various degrees of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is presented [1] . The paper starts with a definition of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and suggests diverse measurement methods [2] . After a short introduction into the lab concept, the results of some test runs are presented where autonomous objects perform the same production program as “dumb” production objects. Finally, an outlook for further research is given.</p>

<p>This paper is framed in a triennial project in the area of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies (ICT) in Mathematics Education. We constituted part of a group of university teachers who engaged in a kind of training teachers in service. In particular we were interested on the use of ICT in two senses: as a means of communication (<span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>) and as a teaching tool (GeoGebra). The work consisted on constructing a process of accompaniment to teachers of Mathematics at middle schools of four localities of Argentinean Patagonia. They were distributed in two groups of two schools each one. One group treated contents of algebra y the other one of functions. The process was to co-generate didactical cycles of three phases: priori analysis, commissioning classroom and posteriori analysis. In this presentation we pay attention to some aspects of the communicational use of the ICT which were made in the algebra group, with special focus in the produced levels of confidence and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.</p>

More particularly, a model is tested in which parental mediation styles and attention to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> advertising at school are related to conceptual and attitudinal advertising literacy in SNG and in which both advertising literacies in turn are related to behavioral intentions. Data were collected among 780 respondents (aged 10-14 years). After showing participants a video compilation of SNG Habbo, a questionnaire was given to the respondents addressing the abovementioned aspects. Results confirmed that <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive restrictive mediation is positively associated with understanding selling intention, while <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive active mediation is positively associated with understanding persuasive intention. In addition, attention to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> advertising at school is related to children’s understanding of persuasive intent. Critical attitude towards SNG advertising is negatively related to pester intention and intention to buy, while understanding persuasive intent is associated with a higher score on both intentions.</p>

The article argues that the workplace level functions as a link between the macro level of external pressures and the micro level of perceived influences on news work. Using principal component analysis we explore the dimensionality of workplace <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> based on a set of 20 survey questions. Regression analysis is then used on the dimensions found in order to determine what affects perception of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the different dimensions. The most salient explanatory variables are found on the country and organisational levels, whereas the variables age, experience, gender, managerial role and medium have no or limited effects. The results show the organisational and country levels being integrated and that national journalistic culture is the most salient factor explaining perception of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.</p>

<p>Abstract <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span>loafing – non-work related <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> use – is a prominent problem in modern firms. While incomplete contracts typically rule out direct control of workers’ effort, many employers hope to increase productivity through ‘soft’ control, by restricting the private use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> at work. In a lab experiment with real effort, we investigate how the temptation of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and a manager’s decision whether to restrict workers’ access to it affect the morale of workers. When tempted by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> access, workers reciprocate fair wages less than without access. Nevertheless, a manager’s decision to actively grant <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> access might increase workers’ effort: we find that highly reciprocal workers perceive the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> such a policy gives as a gift which they reciprocate with high effort despite the temptation of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>. For less reciprocal workers the temptation aspect dominates and restricting <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> access is better for the manager.</p>

<p>This study aimed to analyze the relationship between work processes and subjective processes in the activity of teaching school of distance education (DE).

The results revealed that teachers realize the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies (ICT) as inherent in all spheres of their lives, occurring also an intensification of the workload and the need for them to discipline themselves. The organization of work in distance education requires a new way of structuring, in which there is increased control, which restricts the teaching <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>; socio-professional relations mediated by ICTs make the work of distance education teachers lonelier but at the same time, require a multidisciplinary team to execute the teaching.</p>

<p>With the widespread use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s and portable devices it is inevitable to think of Mobile Assisted Language Learning as a means of independent learning in Higher Education. Nowadays many learners are keen to explore the wide variety of applications available in their portable and always readily available <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s and tablets. The fact that they are keen to take control of their learning and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is thought to lead to greater motivation and engagement, and the link with games-based learning suggests that the fun factor involved should not be overseen. This paper focuses on the use of mobile applications for independent language learning in higher education. It investigates how learners use mobile apps in line with their classes to enhance their learning experience. We base our analysis on a survey carried out in autumn 2013 in which 286 credited and non-credited language students from various levels of proficiency at The University of Manchester express their perceptions on the advantages and disadvantages of the use of mobile applications for independent language learning, together with examples of useful apps and suggestions of how these could be integrated in the language class.</p>

<p>Abstract Adolescence is a time when youth are faced with multiple tasks that intersect and influence one another, e.g., increased desire for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, salience of identity issues, peer orientation, self-focus and self-consciousness, and a continuing need for a safe environment in which to explore <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and identity. These all occur in a dynamic ecosystemic environment, which in the past would have mostly included family, peers, and school, but today also includes <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>space as both a system, and a means to interact with many other systems through the use of multiple forms of information technology (IT). This paper uses the voices and experiences of 128 adolescents, captured in qualitative interviews, to look at <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and identity in the digital age as they talk about their parents vis a vis their use of IT. Thematic analysis revealed two major themes: 1) Adolescents spoke of their expertise. In particular they commented on their knowledge to repair equipment, ability to use IT well, their sense of pride in their own ability and their parents’ acknowledgement of this ability. 2) Subjects perceived little need for their own supervision, but assessed that other adolescents and younger children needed to be watched closely by their parents. Implications of this work are discussed.</p>

<p>Previous literature on democratic quality of political actors website and on the governance of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>ies did not take attention to the role of infrastructure for collective action online.This paper presents an empirical analysis (based on 50 cases of online creation communities) on how infrastructure governance shape the community generated. First, the paper presents a mapping of online creation communities according to their infrastructure governance. The main axes of order in the infrastructure governance are open versus closes to community involvement in the provision organizing. Then, the other significant axes is knowledge policy which in term of infrastructure governance influences the level of freedom and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the collective action in regards to the infrastructure. According to these two axes five models of infrastructure governance resulted: corporate service, university network, representative foundations, mission oriented enterprises, and assamblearian selfprovision.Second, the research provides an empirical explanation of the governance models which are most likely to succeed in creating large-size collective action in terms of the dimensions of participation and complexity of collaboration.Infrastructure governance based on closeness to community involvement in the platform provision and for profit strategies generates bigger communities. Instead, open to community involvement and nonprofit generates smaller communities, even smaller if they are informal. Conditions which favor community freedom and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> generate smaller communities also, but interestingly, they resulted to be the conditions that increase collaboration among the participants.</p>

<p>The term Open Educational Practice (OEP) is often defined as the process of creating and adapting OER. However, in the context of this study, we take OEP to include any practice that opens up a closed educational ecosystem by expanding learners’ social networks and by increasing learners’ participation and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Our study is framed in terms of one of the Research Hub’s guiding hypotheses: OER leads to critical reflection by educators, with evidence of improvement in their practice. In this case, the improved practice refers to how French-language educators sought to overcome prescriptivist attitudes linked to the monolingual orientation of traditional classroom instruction by adopting a translingual paradigm in keeping with recent research in applied linguistics (Cook, 1992, 1999; Blyth, 1995; MLA Report, 2007; Kramsch, 2010; Levine, 2011; Canagarajah, 2015). More precisely, we examine how language educators extended an titled Francais interactif (Blyth, 2009, 2012; Kelton, Guilloteau &amp; Blyth, 2011) by creating an accompanying <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> page as an online space (Gee, 2005) where traditionally proscribed practices such as code switching and lexical borrowing were not only accepted but encouraged. Following Canagarajah (2015), we understand translingual practice as an umbrella term referring to a language learner’s integrated repertoire of communicative strategies based on multiple languages and modalities. We examine the social dynamics of various translingual practices that routinely occur on the Francais interactif <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> page and conclude by arguing that open, translingual affinity spaces provide an ideal place for raising learners’ critical language awareness.</p>

<p>With the development of social network services (SNS) on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, the world has gained access to vast amounts of information resources, allowing people to carefully research and select what they need and want to share with others. The main idea behind open educational resources (OER) is providing freely accessible and openly licensed documents, which fits well with the online learning system using SNS. However, the gap between higher education and social network media in relation to shared activities and OER use remains a challenge. The main reason for this is that teachers lack knowledge of mutual assistance and the skills to use OER. Teachers are dissatisfied with having to use others’ resources, which indicates that the problem lies in teachers’ psychological conflicts and technical capabilities. Our learning platform, Creative Higher Education with Learning Objects (CHiLO), is based on e-textbooks and aims to develop a flexible learning environment. The CHiLO e-textbooks were developed with a completely new design that considered large-scale online courses, such as open online courses. The core component of CHiLO is the CHiLO Book, which is created in EPUB3 format and has media-rich contents, including graphics, animations, audios and embedded videos.

<p>Over the past decade, the frequency of terror attacks around the world has increased. In the context of the 22 July 2011 terror attacks in Norway, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use by citizens, and even victims, became an essential feature of reporting. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social media</span> confronted the legacy media’s way of covering crisis events. It raised questions about traditional journalism’s ability to handle audience’s as, not only news consumers, but also producers. In the present article, we look at the ways in which the professional norms and values of traditional journalism are specifically challenged by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use in times of terror, using the 22 July 2011 attacks as a case study. We find that Norwegian journalists initially held to their professional roles, and to the classic self-representational principles of journalism, including objectivity, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and immediacy. When they integrated <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> into their traditional platforms and modes of coverage, they framed it as a “source” of sorts.

<p>This essay details the results of fifty-four open-ended interview questionnaires with university-level communication students from eleven countries, exploring the opportunities and challenges for journalism and news in participatory democracy. The study participants were enrolled in a three-week summer global media literacy program, at the end of which they were asked to complete an open-ended survey questionnaire, asking about the role digital media technologies and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms have on journalism and its role in a participatory democracy. Results highlight a general negativity toward the growing influence of new media technologies in journalism with regard to objectivity, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, balance, and depth, juxtaposed with the embrace of the same technologies in contributing to greater citizen participation, voice, and inclusion in journalism and news flow. This divide raises questions around the relationship between journalism, journalism education, and technology in the context of participatory citizenship. The study concludes by recommending a more integrative model for journalism education than presently followed that addresses the disjuncture evidenced in this study between professional notions of journalism and participatory citizenship in the digital age.</p>

<p>This paper is a study of blended learning pedagogy in open and distance learning (ODL), involving two universities in Southeast Asia, STOU Thailand and UT Indonesia. The purpose of this study is to understand the issues related to the implementation of blended-learning pedagogy. Existing theories in Distance education (DE) specifically interaction and communication theory proposed by Holmberg (1995), <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and independence theory based on the work Wedemeyer (1981) and Moore (1994) and community of inquiry (CoI) model contributed by Garrison, Anderson, and Archer (2000) are detected to provide a general picture on how practices in teaching-learning provisions and DE theories may inform each other. Qualitative case study was employed to optimize my understanding of the blended learning phenomena gathered through semi-structured interview and documentary analysis. Whilst they operated in different educational settings, these two universities shared similarities. They have developed blended learning pedagogy to promote students’ learning classified into three dimensions: printed learning materials, F2F sessions, and online learning. Printed materials, however, may be identified as a major one and online learning have been regarded as strategic policies for further development. They have been equipped with their VLE; the use of VLE helped these universities to provide two-way traffic communications. They have been involved in developing <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>-based instruction to widening access and to meet challenges for better future.</p>

<p>IBM <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things (IoT) research focuses on three components to address the multiple challenges of a scalable, secure and efficient IoT: Technology strategy, business and economic insights, and product and user experience design. By merging these three streams of research, IBM developed a tangible vision of the connected future and findings that can guide executives in making strategic IoT decisions and investments. As the IoT scales exponentially, decentralized networks have the potential to reduce infrastructure and maintenance costs to manufacturers. Decentralization also promise increased robustness by removing single points of failure that could exists in traditional centralized networks. By shifting the power in the network from the center to the edges, devices gain greater <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and can become points of transactions and economic value creation for owners and users.</p>

This study uses a goal hierarchy approach to deepen our understanding of the relationship between the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> and psychological well-being (PWB) in young adults. The study applies a mixed-method design that combines means-end analysis and regression analysis to examine data collected from laddering interviews with 161 <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> users. The means-end chain analysis provided knowledge of the hierarchical goal structure in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> (i.e., activitiesmediated goalsultimate goals).

<p>Global software engineering education (GSEE) is aimed at providing software engineering (SE) students with knowledge, skills, and understanding of working in globally distributed arrangements so they can be prepared for the global SE (GSE) paradigm. It is important to understand the challenges involved in GSEE for improving the quality and experience of educators and students. This paper reports the findings of an empirical study on the socio-cultural aspects of GSEE. A case study was conducted involving 14 participants from ten different universities in eight countries. The data was analyzed using grounded theory’s open coding procedure. The key contributions of this paper are the identification and description of seven dimensions of socio-cultural distance that caused several significant challenges in the courses: 1) language differences; 2) concept of time; 3) attitude toward grades; 4) assumptions about national culture; 5) differences in <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>; 6) influence of the course lecturer; and 7) work habits. Recommendations from this paper that are expected to benefit GSEE educators and students include: cross-cultural orientation of students prior to the course; use of various strategies to support better comprehension of different English accents (e.g., speaking slowly, replaying recorded video messages, and text <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>ting); and educators familiarizing themselves and their students with the relevant GSE and GSEE literature.</p>

<p>The role of the new media&nbsp;in agenda setting in BelarusVictor Martinovich SummaryThe author starts with defining the nature of the political regime that acts in Belarus, providing a list of the key features that are important for media behaviour. The list is extracted from the relevant comparative researches focused on Belarus. After describing the regime as a set of rules for the media, the text then proceeds to the specific morphology of the Belarussian new media that do not comply with the basic characteristics proposed by media researchers and thus can be recognized as old media restructured to meet the ethics and principles of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. Then the author deals with the agenda setting process in Belarus and proposes his own interpretation of the classical logistics of this process in specific Belarussian circumstances where the list of power-bearing actors is dramatically reduced. The paper is finalized with showing the new possibilities that the media as an actor of public policy have obtained in the agenda setting after appearance of Web 2.0 when sites the have been&nbsp;re-structured on the basis of the user-generated content which helps to retrieve the media’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and possibilities to influence the agenda setting.Key words: public policy theory, new media, agenda-setting process, political regimes</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a case study of using blended learning to enhance students language skills and learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in an Asian university environment. Blended learning represents an educational environment for much of the world where computers and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> are readily available. It combines self‑study with valuable face‑to‑face interaction with a teacher. This study puts the spotlight on learning outcomes in an English for Specific Purposes (ESP) class in Thailand in which e‑learning strategies are used in parallel with traditional classroom language teaching methods of the four language learning skills. These skills are listening, speaking, reading and writing. The achievements and attitudes of students were compared between the control group and the experimental group to measure the potential of available technology to develop language skills and learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The findings from this study show that online practice is directly beneficial to enhance the four language learning skills as well as autonomous learning and learner motivation.</p>

<p>In 2007, 10 groups of college students in an introductory-level religion course were asked to create a new religion that would appeal to their peers. This article analyzes the content of those religions, as well as student reflections on them, in light of quantitative studies and original analysis of a sample of college students drawn from Wave 3 of the National Study of Youth and Religion. It finds that college students see themselves and their cohort as interested primarily in religions that revolve around three axes: tolerance and inclusivity, moral and intellectual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and this-worldly happiness. These findings suggest that a synthesis of literature on the life course and on American moral culture provides the best analytical framework for viewing American college student approaches to religion and spirituality.</p>

<p>In this paper, we argue that censorware is one of the bogeymen that instills fear in parents whose children have access to the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. It is a fear that has the potential to restrict children’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and opportunities for engagement in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. Fear regarding children’s online activities is one of the issues surrounding children’s <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> safety that does not appear to be situated in any particular social or cultural context. Among the most popular means of monitoring children online, censorware may prove even more harmful to children’s socioemotional wellbeing and development than any other form of monitoring (Boyd &amp; Jenkins, 2006; Cloke &amp; Jones, 2005; Helwig, 2006; Kamii, 1991; Laufer &amp; Wolfe, 1977; Marx &amp; Steeves, 2010; Pettit &amp; Laird, 2002; Rooney, 2010). Inherent in the design and use of censorware are structures that inhibit children’s online and offline social interactions, their ability to develop fully as social actors, and their experience of being empowered to make informed and critical decisions about their lives, including choices relating to privacy. As well, reliance on surveillance-based approach-es to monitoring online activities of chil-dren (aged 5-14) may actually be leading to a greater danger: a decrease in oppor-tunities for children to have experiences that help them develop <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and independence. Our inquiry is located within a growing body of research that addresses the social implications of restricting, surveilling and controlling young children’s online activities versus nurturing individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> through parental mentoring and critically reflec-tive software and social technology use.</p>

<p>This article raises the question of whether in both the United States and in France, an individual’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and private decision-making right(s) in matters of health care and access to reproductive technologies can be conciliated with the general interest, and more specifically, the role of the State. Can a full-fledged right to privacy, the ability to exercise one’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, exist alongside the general interest, and depend neither on financial resources like in the United States nor on centralised government decisions or the medical hierarchy like in France? The contrast between these two modern democracies justify the importance of comparing them. I will demonstrate that overlaps do exist: the free exercise of religion and opinion, freedom of expression, the inherent value of each individual. What differs, however, are the institutions and how they provide, protect, promote, or frame access to and expressions of these democratic principles. The impact of the global economy, the exposure of people around the world to each other via the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>, and the mirror effects of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, blogs, and other such forums, have created new perspectives that countries project onto one another. For example, does France now seem to tout ‘<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>’ as a new and important value because it appears to be an ‘American success story’? Does the United States now seem to value human rights and a social-democratic approach because of the ‘French model’? There seems to be some truth behind these assertions, but as this article will demonstrate, the portrayals of what the ‘right to privacy’ is in the United States and what ‘socialised medicine’ is in France are not necessarily fully accurate.</p>

<p>The free exchange of data between many interconnected nodes, in the absence of a central point of control, has been at the heart of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>’s architecture since its inception. For its engineering architects “if the Web was to be a universal resource, it had to grow in an unlimited way”, thus “its being ‘out of control’ was very important” (Berners-Lee and Fischetti, 1999). Yet, this simple deign choice has had a serious impact on conventional legal thinking. This paper highlights the importance of online decentralized architecture as the perfect substantiation of the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> rational underpinning the right to free speech.In doing so the paper analyses the core principles supporting the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>’s architecture on their merit to the promote the user’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and self-realisation through speech. Following the free speech rationale for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, it is observed how some simple engineering decisions for an open decentralised communicatory platform can build a user-centric ecology for speech. To validate this hypothesis two main architectural choices are examined as to the potential they hold for free speech: the principles of Modularity and End-to-End (E2E).The paper concludes that in terms of free speech, law and net architecture should be seen as complementing factors instead of opposite controlling deities. In this respect, Lessig’s mantra that “code is law” is paraphrased to read as “law encoded”, meaning that the law should strive to maintain the core architectural <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> values promoting human rights, and free speech in particular.</p>

<p>The sex industry is increasingly operated through online technologies, whether this is selling services online through webcam or advertising, marketing or organising sex work through the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and digital technologies. Using data from a survey of 240 <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>-based sex workers (members of the National Ugly Mug reporting scheme in the UK), we discuss the working conditions of this type of work. We look at the basic working patterns, trajectories and everyday experiences of doing sex work via an online medium and the impact this has on the lives of sex workers. For instance, we look at levels of control individuals have over their working conditions, prices, clientele and services sold, and discuss how this is mediated online and placed in relation to job satisfaction. The second key finding is the experience of different forms of crimes individuals are exposed to such as harassment and blackmail via the new technologies. We explore the relationship <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>-based sex workers have with the police and discuss how current laws in the UK have detrimental effects in terms of safety and access to justice. These findings are placed in the context of the changing landscape of sex markets as the digital turn determines the nature of the majority of commercial sex encounters. These findings contribute significantly to the populist coercion/choice political debates by demonstrating levels and types of agency and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> experienced by some sex workers despite working in a criminalized, precarious and sometimes dangerous context.</p>

<p>To analyze the relationship between perception of support for student <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and the interaction of different motivational contexts of the intention to do physical exercise from the framework of the trans-contextual model of motivation (Hagger &amp; <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Chat</span>zisarantis, 2016) was the aim of this study. The sample consisted of 441 adolescents in physical education classes aged between 12 and 16 (Mage = 14.74, SD = .80), who responded to various questionnaires on perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support, motivation in the education and leisure contexts, and intention to do exercise. The model was tested using a structural equation model. The results of structural equation modeling [χ2 (48, N = 441) = 489,69, p = .001, χ2/d.f = 3.98, CFI = .94, IFI = .94, TLI = .93, RMSEA = .08] marked that perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support from the teacher was positively relacionated with intrinsic motivation in physical education classes, which in turn was positively associated with intrinsic motivation in leisure time. Perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support from family and peers was positively associated with motivation in leisure time, which in turn positively associated with the attitude and control standards. While the intention to practice physical activity was positively associated with the main concepts of the theory of planned behavior. Results are discussed in view of the importance of considering the importance of social models in the stage of adolescence, highlighting the role of promoting <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and their influence on inter-contextual motivation in physical exercise.</p>

<p>There is a general misconception that religion and development do not mix, and a strong belief that religion has a negative effect on development. Against this background, this paper showed that African traditional religion can aid national development in Nigeria. This it does through its traditional ethical principles based on the communal concern for the well-being of all, principles founded not on the ethics of individualism, human <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and selfishness, but on a common unity-centered. These traditional ethical principles, sanctions and es<span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>ological beliefs regulated the behaviour, conduct, and actions of individuals in African society. Ethical principles, sanctions and es<span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>ological concepts were the factors that kept individuals and government in check. The paper also x-rayed how African traditional religion can play a vital role in the national development of contemporary Nigerian society through its ethical principles and practices. This argued that the moral salvation of Nigerians lie in their immediate and conscious return to traditional socio-religious values and morals system which is the foundation for genuine conscience and national development.

<p>The availability of smart phones connected to mobile network and the occurrence of APPs developed for the educational purposes provide us with the possibility and feasibility of mobile teaching and learning. English Fun Dubbing, an APP designed for its users to practice oral English, was employed in this one-academic-year empirical study to evaluate the benefits of mobile APPs in the field of pedagogy. When the study ended, an anonymous online questionnaire was distributed to the 123 participants to survey the effects of English Fun Dubbing on their English language learning. The results showed that the majority of the respondents were satisfied with it in many aspects including its conveniences, flexibility, user-friendliness, rich materials, authentic language context, etc. and also its functions to inspire learning interests, foster learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, help realize personalized learning, and so on. We concluded that a reasonable and wise choice of APPs would not only be useful for students’ English learning, but also help lead them to use <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s in a positive way.</p>

<p>Abstract Smart Cities need to be designed to allow the inclusion of all kinds of citizens. For instance, motor disabled people like wheelchair users may have problems to interact with the city. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things (IoT) technologies provide the tools to include all citizens in the Smart City context. For example, wheelchair users may not be able to reach items placed beyond their arm’s length, limiting their independence in everyday activities like shopping, or visiting libraries. We have developed a system that enables wheelchair users to interact with items placed beyond their arm’s length, with the help of Augmented Reality (AR) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technologies. Our proposed system is an interactive AR application that runs on different interfaces, allowing the user to digitally interact with the physical items on the shelf, thanks to an updated inventory provided by an RFID system. The resulting experience is close to being able to browse a shelf, clicking on it and obtaining information about the items it contains, allowing wheelchair users to shop independently, and providing <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in their everyday activities. Fourteen wheelchair users with different degrees of impairment have participated in the study and development of the system. The evaluation results show promising results towards more independence of wheelchair users, providing an opportunity for equality improvement.</p>

<p>This paper explores Buddhist images of the body, and in particularly the female body, as expressed in the Theragāthā and the Therīgāthā. In 1930 I. B. Horner argued that Buddhism brought women a level of equality, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and respect unprecedented in pre-Buddhist India. Women gained control over their own lives and were no longer seen as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>tel that could only live through and on a man. In Horner’s words, Buddhism not only challenged the caste system, “but also attempted to promote the cause of rights for women. While it is probably true that Buddhism offered women an outlet for self-expression which they otherwise would have found hard to find, it would be an exaggeration to claim that Buddhism championed women rights. From the beginning, the eight special rules for bhikkhunīs guaranteed that they would remain under the power of the bhikkhus. Furthermore, more recent research on women in Buddhism has highlighted that the Buddhist position toward women was both ambiguous and at times contradictory. On the one hand, women were seen as a danger to a man’s spiritual progress because of their perceived association with sensuality and procreation. On the other hand, Buddhism acknowledged that women were just as capable of achieving enlightenment as their male counterparts. The result was an attitude toward women which, while spiritually accepting, was at the same time infused with patriarchy and a male distrust of the feminine. Moreover, what the Theragāthā and the Therīgāthā suggest is that patriarchy was so pervasive in early Buddhism that the bhikkhunīs effectively adopted and internalized bhikkhus’ attitudes toward the female body.</p>

<p>The twenty-first century higher education sector has come a long way after undergoing continuous metamorphosis from pedagogy to andragogy. Most of the educational approaches adopted in medical schools are directed towards developing more of competencies and less of capability, which is the ability to use competencies in novel contexts. Competencies alone are not sufficient to thrive in the present day work place as medical profession subsumes complex contexts; it is in this scenario that, medical educators are entrusted with the challenging task of developing “capable learners”. In the heutagogical approach, learners are required to decide upon what to learn and how to learn and therefore the control of the learning process is on the learner and the role of the teacher becomes that of a navigator. This paper highlights the current higher educational practices based on heutagogy, considers its application in the context of Problem-based learning and also discusses a few challenges in incorporating this approach in the existing undergraduate medical curriculum. The article proposes the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> in order to support learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, which in turn improves learners’ cognitive engagement with content and tasks, thereby assisting the development of attributes associated with capability.</p>

<p>Marine robots are playing important roles in environmental sensing andocean observation applications. This tutorial introduces the overall systemsarchitecture and patterns for data streams that enable <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>for marine robots in environmental sensing applications. The articleproposes the concept of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-maritime cycle and surveys its use as arecent development in marine robotics. Supported by communicationnetworks, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> can be achieved using at least three feedback loopsin a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-maritime cycle, each running at different time scales or temporalfrequencies. When information is circulating around the cycle, itis transformed between two representations: the Lagrangian view andthe Eulerian view. Important functional blocks, such as mission planning,path planning, data assimilation, and data-driven modeling arediscussed as providing conversions between the two views of data. Thetutorial starts with an overview of enabling technologies in sensing,navigation, and communication for marine robotics. The design of experimentmethod is then reviewed to plan optimal sensing locations forthe robots. The tutorial discusses a class of path planning methods thatproduces desired trajectories of marine robots while combating oceancurrent. The lack of an accurate Eulerian map for ocean current willlead to tracking error when robots attempt to follow the planned pathsto collect Lagrangian data. The performance of robot navigation can beevaluated through the controlled Lagrangian particle tracking method,which computes trends and bounds for the growth of the tracking error.To improve the accuracy of the Eulerian map of ocean current, adata-driven modeling approach is adopted. Data assimilation methodsare leveraged to convert Lagrangian data into Eulerian map. In addition,the spatial and temporal resolution of Eulerian data maps canbe further improved by the motion tomography method. This tutorialgives a comprehensive view of data streams and major functional blocksunderlying <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of marine robots.</p>

This research explores how Reddit’s users, moderators, and administrators surface values (like free speech, privacy, dignity, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>), hint at ethical principles (what content, speech, behavior ought to be restricted and under what conditions), through a continuous process of (re)negotiating expectations and norms around values, ethics, and power on the site. Central to this research are questions such as: Who or what influences and/or determines social practice on Reddit? Who participates in decision-making and using what processes and mechanisms? Where do controversies arise and how are they resolved? Generating findings from a particular controversy surrounding the subreddit /r/jailbait, the author illustrates the complexities inherent in these questions and suggests that a participatory policymaking approach might contribute to future research and practice in this area.</p>

<p>Gifted student may underperform if unmotivated. Teachers can help students who are gifted to be motivated by using technology to help provide <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and authenticity in the curriculum. Technology can be used as a tool for student <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> when it is used in ways that give the student choices. Teacher can use the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> to provide students access to different topics. When students can control the depth and breadth of content through what they learn using technology, they are motivated. Technology also allows individual students control over the pacing of learning when they can accelerate through easily mastered or already mastered material, and then slow down when something particularly interesting is encountered. Authenticity, where students are doing work or experiencing learning activities that are equivalent to adult or expert experiences, are accessible to students through technology, but only if teachers plan for it. Particularly web 2.0 technologies allow students to create authentic products for authentic audiences because the can publish and share a variety of media. Technology can facilitate student collaboration and allow for mentoring from experts. Gifted students, who can be motivated by competition, can also increase the competitions available to them by looking for competitions online. Teachers control student access to and uses for technology within the school setting. If teachers are concerned about students who are gifted developing to their full potential, then planning for motivation makes sense and technology is a ready tool.</p>

<p>This article reflects on some of the major changes in the ways that people are working today, changes often driven by a preference for greater <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and choice, but also to work on a sharing, collaborative or networked basis. Many of the growing numbers of independent professionals are attracted by these ways of working. Developments in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>y have been critical, especially in enabling services, including professional services, to be delivered via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> platforms. This has created, in effect, new forms of intermediation and increasingly complex work relationships. These developments have often proved very controversial, as instanced by the disputes surrounding Uber, the international, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>-based taxi provider. Many of these changes also raise issues of accountability and work quality, along with creating new patterns of work relationships. Inevitably, the changes also highlight the role of regulation, which is the main focus of this article The topic is explored against a backdrop of much recent deregulation, challenges to so-called ‘red tape’ and laissez faire policies. The myriad of disputes and litigation involving Uber is examined and reflected upon. There are, of course, many differences between the taxi drivers of Uber and the designers, journalists, engineers and consultants, typical of independent professional working, but there are also some key parallels and experiences that provide a cautionary tale!</p>

Sudbury, MA: Jones and Bartlett Publishers, 2000. i65 pp.&nbsp;ISBN 0-7637-i269-8.Deregulation and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>’s expansion have brought with them decentralized control in communications and publishing. Individuals have gained extraordinary power in exercising free speech and, if they so choose, encrypting that speech to protect it. As this virtual space becomes a greater part of our lives, society is faced with readdressing the social issues of free speech, privacy, intellectual property, and security issues in the context of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>space.<span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span>ethics does not profess to have the answers. It presents issues as a starting point for discussion. There is a need to go beyond law, norms, market place, and software code to find answers for regulating behavior in this new medium called <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>space. We must also consider the fundamental principles of ethics, principles with a universal quality that transcend space and time. We must be cautious in our decisions to ensure that we do not sacrifice justice and human rights for the sake of the majority. Regulating through external forces can be e∂ective to some degree, but there is greater value in having fixed ethical values as the constraining force, values that promote an atmosphere where individuals can pursue their own well-being, a place where they can flourish. With this premise in mind (the need for an ethical groundwork when addressing the social issues surrounding the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>), Spinello’s work explores how the basic values of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and privacy should be the core for those who would regulate <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>space to ensure that decisions made will be fair and just.Utilitarian rights promulgated by Mill and Bentham; the contractual rights of Locke, Rousseau, and Rawls; the natural rights of Aquinas and Finnis; the pluralism of Kant: each philosophy contributes possibilities for approaches to an ethical backbone for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>space. From utilitarianism comes cost benefit analysis with its inherent flaw of possibly subverting human rights if it benefits a majority. Spinello uses the monitoring of corporate <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> as an example of weighing the benefit versus the cost for such behavior. In the contractual discussion, i.e., the implicit social contract between an individual and society, property and privacy rights are used to illustrate that although the premise is appealing, utilitarianism gives no guidelines for choosing one right over another when each is valued. Spamming is used to illustrate the complexity of this need to have guidelines for selection when one value interferes with another. Marketers consider mass e-mailings as a right under free speech, while the recipients take issue with invasion of privacy and misuse of valuable resources (employee time and computer storage). Natural rights look at the individual’s right to flourish, the right to truth in communication, the right not to be falsely accused, etc. Policies for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>communication should support this right to flourish. Introducing Kant’s concept of a universal principle into the discussion of online provision o∂ers a basis for fair service. Proposed services should be examined in light of whether expanding the service will be acceptable as a universal principle and not just expedient for the individual creating it. Are all treated with the respect that one would expect for oneself if the service is initiated? The flaw in this comes with its lack of flexibility for competing values. Using these guiding principles for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>space, we must first judge whether any policy imposed is partial, and second, whether it is fair and just, not for a majority, but for all.Spinello challenges the reader to give thought to best solutions for very di[double dagger]cult questions. …</p>

<p>ABSTRACTIn feminist literature, there is a sense that the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> amplifies women’s voices in a public sphere crowded by male domination. But how is this possible, when the attributes of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s (mobility, connectivity, sociability) contradict the socialisation of women, particularly in Africa, where a ‘desirable’ femininity entails withdrawal from public spaces, shyness and being mostly confined to domestic settings? Using domestication theory, this study explores these questions through in-depth interviews with young female and male students in three higher learning institutions in Harare. While the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> amplify the importance of identity construction and the psychological need by young women to formulate an empowering sense of self, there is a dialectical tension between the need for women’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> from disempowering social processes vis-a-vis conformity to social hierarchy. Overall, these technologies – among other more formal processes such as education and legislati…</p>

<p>The use of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> by the senior citizens in order to manage operations with the government and companies requires further study. The objective of this work is to take a close look at the reasons why older people make limited use of e-administration and online procedures. Using a qualitative methodology, based on four focus groups, we analyze the motivations and problems they find when using such procedures. The results indicate acceptance of electronic resources for simple and routine tasks due to the speed and convenience they offer, which simultaneously promotes the independence and empowerment of older people. However, there is a series of factors which have a negative effect on their use, and these must be dealt with in order to favor greater digital inclusion of this age demographic.</p>

<p>Abstract Classical productions systems are migrating step-by-step into <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-physical production systems. The addition of much more computing power and object-bound data storage will lead to new possibilities for the advancement of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in production systems. Autonomous message exchange and coordination can help to prevent quality problems (for instance wrong pairing of tool and work piece) and improve the disturbance management (for instance by faster information about current and probable disturbances). Due to the fact that nearly all improvements of existing production systems with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-physical systems take place in real and active manufacturing sites, on-site experiments to find out the right degree of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for production objects are not suitable. Therefore a lab approach is necessary. In this contribution a hybrid lab approach to simulate various degrees of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is presented [1] . The paper starts with a definition of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and suggests measurement methods [2] . After a short introduction into the lab concept the results of some test runs are presented where autonomous objects perform the same production program as dumb production objects. Finally, an outlook for further research is given.</p>

<p>As autonomous and semiautonomous systems are developed for automotive, aviation, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>, robotics and other applications, the ability of human operators to effectively oversee and interact with them when needed poses a significant challenge. An automation conundrum exists in which as more <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is added to a system, and its reliability and robustness increase, the lower the situation awareness of human operators and the less likely that they will be able to take over manual control when needed. The human-<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> systems oversight model integrates several decades of relevant <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> research on operator situation awareness, out-of-the-loop performance problems, monitoring, and trust, which are all major challenges underlying the automation conundrum. Key design interventions for improving human performance in interacting with autonomous systems are integrated in the model, including human-automation interface features and central automation interaction paradigms comprising levels of automation, adaptive automation, and granularity of control approaches. Recommendations for the design of human-<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> interfaces are presented and directions for future research discussed.</p>

<p>Abstract: A dissonance is a conflict between individual, collective or organizational knowledge. This concept is extended to a conflict of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> between components of a human-machine system, such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span>-Physical &amp; Human Systems (CPHS). The <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the CPHS is modeled by a triplet representing three sets of knowledge: the Competence, the Availability and the Prescription. The so-called Competence-Availability-Prescription (CAP) model is then proposed to represent the capability of the CPHS to act alone and to control possible emergent behaviours such as conflicts of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in terms of competence, availability and/or prescription. The formalism of the Petri nets is used to model the three CAP model parameters and to control possible conflicts between them. A feasibility study of the application of such CAP model and Petri nets is presented for the car driving domain involving the car driver interacting with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span>-Physical Systems (CPS) such as an Automated Speed Control System (ASCS).</p>

<p>Community-dwelling consumers of healthcare are increasing, many aging with life-limiting conditions and deteriorating cognition. However, few have had advance care planning discussions or completed documentation to ensure future care preferences are acted upon. This study examines the awareness, attitudes, and experiences of advance care planning amongst older people and unrelated offspring/caregivers of older people residing in the community.Qualitative descriptive research, which included focus groups with older people (55+ years) and older people’s offspring/caregivers living in an Australian city and surrounding rural region. Data was analysed using an inductive and comparative approach. Sampling was both convenience and purposive. Participants responded to web-based, newsletter or <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> invitations from an agency, which aims to support healthcare consumers, a dementia support group, or community health centres in areas with high proportions of culturally and linguistically diverse community-dwellers.Eight focus groups were attended by a homogenous sample of 15 older people and 27 offspring/caregivers, with 43% born overseas. The overarching theme, ‘shades of grey’: struggles in transition, reflects challenges faced by older people and their offspring/caregivers as older people often erratically transition from independence and capacity to dependence and/or incapacity. Offspring/caregivers regularly struggled with older people’s fluctuating <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and dependency as older people endeavoured to remain at home, and with conceptualising “best times” to actualise advance care planning with substitute decision maker involvement. Advance care planning was supported and welcomed, x advance care planning literacy was evident. Difficulties planning for hypothetical health events and socio-cultural attitudes thwarting death-related discussions were emphasised. Occasional offspring/caregivers with previous substitute decision maker experience reported distress related to their decisions.Advance care planning programs traditionally assume participants are ‘planning ready’ to legally appoint a substitute decision maker (power of attorney) and record end-of-life treatment preferences in short time frames. This contrasts with how community dwelling older people and offspring/caregivers conceive future care decisions over time. Advance care planning programs need to include provision of information, which supports older people’s advance care planning understanding and management, and also supports offspring/caregivers’ development of strategies for broaching advance care planning with older people, and preparing for potential substitute decision maker roles. Development and integration of strategies to support older people’s decision-making when in the ‘grey zone’, with fluctuating cognitive capacities, needs further consideration. Findings support an advance care planning model with conversations occurring at key points across a person’s lifespan.</p>

<p>In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Bitcoin emerged as an alternative monetary system that could circumvent political and financial authorities. A practice in libertarian prefigurative politics, Bitcoin demonstrates the capacity for online subgroups to creatively appropriate <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>-based technologies to enact alternative futures. Andrew Feenberg’s critical theory of technology clarifies this capacity and outlines the significance of agency in technical action. As technology mediates many social relations, it has a significant role in the reproduction of social power. Technological agency is therefore a crucial site of resistance in which users can form alternative, democratic rationalizations of technology. Yet are such instances of agency intrinsically democratic? In analysing this aspect of Feenberg’s theory, this article argues that Bitcoin represents a ‘popular rationalization’ of technology – a creative appropriation of technology that empowers some groups while lacking the ethical justification necessary to be considered democratic.</p>

<p>This article presents an analysis of the revealed knowledge concerning the teaching practice in the interaction and mediation process developed by means of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>s in the virtual environment Moodle, throughout 2014, involving Science and Chemistry teachers of local schools, undergraduate students and professors of the Chemistry teaching degree course in the Universidade de Passo Fundo - RS. The extension project “Training for Science/Chemistry teachers: round of conversation involving teachers’ knowledge and practices” aims to establish the so called “Triads of Professional (interaction) Training”. This process aims to problematize the knowledge by experience and to allow reflection, an important aspect for the constitution of a teacher’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and protagonism. Data was analyzed based on a Discourse Textual Analysis. Results indicate that teachers have a being knowledge and a doing knowledge that originate from practice, but that need to be revealed and problematized so that it can produce progress and qualify the teaching action. The interaction process involving the triad is potentially significant for the continuous training.</p>

<p>Introduction : With an ageing population, the issue of care provision is becoming increasingly critical. Since the aspiration of the majority of older people is to live safely and well at home, housing monitoring will be part of health &amp; care integration in the next decades. As a consequence, a higher proportion of people will have to rely on family, friends or neighbours as their informal caregivers, providing that this group already count as around 80% of all caregivers in the EU). The varied and cumulative problems that this caregivers face include loss of personal opportunities and self-esteem, financial problems or physical and emotional problems. Several strategies need to be enforced to prevent the burnout and improve the quality of life of these informal caregivers, such as the possibility of providing them with useful and reliable monitoring tools that can help reduce the exhausting and continuous supervision activity they have to perform, reduce their stress, and increase their leisure time while improving the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and wellness of the dependent people. The technological solutions currently in use are invasive (wearable sensors) or require actions difficult to perform by the elder (call or press the button), in critical situations (e.g.&nbsp;falling or fainting situations, where the elder is not able to give any response). As an alternative to these solutions, this paper describes <em>Care Respite, a novel non-invasive, real-time and privacy-preserving monitoring technology conceived for the first time as a real respite for those taking care of others</em> and describes the results of the case studies. Short description : The Care Respite technology is composed of an ambient intelligent device (AID) and a remote receiver. The AID device includes a Microsoft Kinect multi-modal sensor and a computer unit. The sensor captures audio and depth maps from around 25 m2 (thanks to its infrared structured light technology) to be processed in a computer unit by an advanced generation of Computer Vision software. This software is able to recognize specific events like: leaving the environment, falling/fainting, high agitation, etc. Monitoring can be done in dark environments thanks to the infrared technology of the sensor, therefore the appearance of the person is not used at all. The alert is transmitted to a receiver, any <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> connection. With our <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> application, different caregivers can share the monitoring task of a single person, and a single caregiver can monitor multiple dependent people at the same time. Key findings : The innovative aspect of Care Respite relies on (i) the benefits of the incorporation and exploitation of novel computer vision technologies now available thanks to the use of low-cost depth cameras, and (ii) on the feedback provided by informal and professional caregivers during these last two years. No other monitoring system in the market addressed to the caregivers is comparable in terms of safety, relief, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, satisfaction, intimacy and cost reduction. The system does not require a fixed installation point, therefore the monitoring camera can be placed anywhere inside a home or a retirement house. Highlights : Low cost RGB-D cameras are completely changing the computer vision world, as they are being successfully used in several applications and research areas. Following this trend, the first users of Care Respite liked the idea of exploiting depth data (not the appearance) recorded at the older person’s homes to send alarms and information to their caregivers, who are connected using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>. An additional feature that liked the first users of Care Respite is its personalization aspect: the remote <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> application allows the professionals or family carers to choose which risky events to monitor. Another lesson learnt during implementation is that the remote visualization and communication via image and audio is an essential and supporting tool for fast responses in case of risk, while improving the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and life quality of both the elderly and their caregivers. Conclusion : This project aims at ensuring that all disabled or chronically ill people can get the help they need without overburdening their families. Improving carers’ quality of life and preventing their burnout require new solutions that are affordable and user friendly for families and caregivers. In this context, Care Respite represents a technological solution for the automatic detection of events like falling down, not moving during a period of time, receiving an unexpected visit or being absent from a room. The intelligent software is able to send an alert to the mobile device of the caregivers allowing real time response.</p>

<p>The vertiginous evolution of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICT) and the advent of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> propitiated the emergence of a networked society marked by deep changes in the economy, stimulating the emergence of new paradigms, models, educational communication processes and new learning scenarios. It is precisely one of these models – a pedagogical model to deconstruct moving pictures-, that we intend to analyze, describing its impact on the academic self-concept of twenty-four graduate students, based on the qualitative analysis of their own perceptions and narratives. The results show that these pedagogical model environments – whose design is anchored in the principles of socio-constructivism, collaborative learning, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, flexibility and interaction – may have very positive effects on the academic self-concept of higher education students in the various dimensions taken into consideration: Motivation, task Orientation, Confidence in their own capacities and Relationship with colleagues. The implications of the results are discussed not only from a practical intervention point of view, but also in terms of future research.</p>

<p>In a flexible language learning system, developed at a French university and gradually improved through Action Research, different elements are combined: individual work on a virtual learning environment (VLE), pair-work and counselling appointments. One of the objectives of the system is to help the students involved progress towards <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> – defined as “the ability to take charge of one’s own learning” (Holec 1981: 3) or “as the capacity to take control over one’s own learning” (Benson 2001: 2) – in their learning of English. The implementation of the system involves a new conception of the different actors’ roles. Teachers become tutors, or counsellors, as defined by CRAPEL (Gremmo, 1995; Ciekanski, 2005) with new specific pedagogical goals (Bertin, Grave &amp; Narcy-Combes, 2010) and the learners have a new role to play. The introduction of two new guidance tools over the last years – a logbook, and specific sections in the existing forum of the VLE – were meant to help the students develop a reflexive approach and thus enhance autonomization, or developing learners’ capacity to learn (Holec 1990: 77), and, in a second time, to promote the development of collaborative learning strategies and encourage the students to use strategies which they would not primarily have thought of. The guidance tools used in this specific language learning environment such as the counselling appointments, the logbook, and the forum, may influence the roles played by the different actors, but also the representations they have of their own roles, which may have an impact on their motivation and thus on the autonomization process (Dickinson, 1995). From the creation of the flexible system five years ago, the research has studied a population of 610 students through quantitative and qualitative analyses (<span style="background-color:lightgreen">Chat</span>eau, 2008; <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Chat</span>eau &amp; Zumbihl, 2010). Focusing on the results obtained with the last population of students, the paper discusses the differences between them and the previous populations, and in particular whether the evolution of the roles played by the different actors, as compared with traditional language teaching/learning situations, has been enhanced.</p>

<p>Rapid development of information technology makes life easier; however, negative aspects of its influence can be recognized as well. Using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> provides series of opportunities for better communication, higher quality education and great fun but involves a lot of risk. Young people spend majority of their time using digital technologies, therefore becoming key actors in creating good or bad peer communication. The young/adolescents are also exposed to the highest level of risk on the net because they have high level of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and independence, because <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> erases social brakes, gives them fake feeling of safety and power, allows users say and do things they couldn’t do in face-to-face communication. The young have the feeling they aren’t responsible for that kind of behavior in a way they would normally be responsible, they are sure that on the net they won’t be judged by their looks; relations on the net seem safer than real relations, there are nosocial boundaries; two lonely souls can communicate without being watched. Among the most mentioned risks are various forms of digital violence, from disturbing to most severe forms of violence, exposure to inappropriate content, exposure to political, economic and religious propaganda, disinformation, privacy threat, soliciting gambling and illegal activities. One way of protection on the net in order to prevent unwanted communication is to educate students, parents and teachers about the risks of digital technology and digital literacy.Parents consider that they are sufficiently informed about what their children do online, but think they need more information and education. The role of schools in preventing digital violence is very important because it is the place where children in an organized way spend most time during th e day. The educational mission of school is to promote social relationships with students, colleagues and parents, and educational task is to teach about the use of modern media and technology, with special emphasis on digital literacy. Therefore, the school and its employees have an extremely important role in the prevention of abuse of digital technology.</p>

<p>Objetive: To evaluate the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of first-year university students at the University of Chile in 2015 Material and Method: Observational, transversal, and analytical study of first year students, 17 to 18 years of age, attending 14 Faculties, 2 Institutes, and 1 Bachelor Program of the University of Chile. Delivery of Kidscreen-52 test by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> to 3,738 students, of which 1,277 replied (34.16%). The Winsteps program model and Rasch punctuation were used. Results: The dimensions Physical Well-being, State of Mood and Emotions, and <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> scored less than 42 Rasch points, and the other two dimensions – Psychological Well-being and Friends and Social Support - had significantly lower scores than those found in Chilean adolescents of a comparable age, in women, in students of lower socio-economical levels in municipal public schools with a Scholar Vulnerability Index, or those with a disability, health problem, or chronic illness. The differences are greater in Faculties with heavier academic demands. Discussion: This first study gives new information in an area seldom studied, which is important for students, academics, and authorities. It is suspected that similar results would be found in other university settings. Conclusions: HRQoL studies are feasible to apply in institutions of higher education, to benefit both students and educators. This study contributes to the diagnosis and evaluation of public policies on student support, and for teaching strategies. In the near future, HRQoL instruments could be applied with other students and other members of the university community, in combination with studies on risk factors.</p>

<p>As leading languages spoken all over the world, a number of learning and teaching sites or pages on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> specifically concerning the teaching of English, French, German and Spanish are available. A review of these sites shows that they have low standards as opposed to language teaching CD-ROMs. Generally speaking, affected largely from the structural approach, these sites present structural exercises while employing very few possibilities expected from the vast possibilities of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. In the absence of satisfactory explanations in relation to previously determined objectives and direction towards other sites, the students are not only misdirected but also exposed to trouble some self-measurement processes.

<p>The notion of privacy has long had a central role in human rights law, not least in connection to health and medicine. International, regional and national bodies have enacted a number of binding and non-binding document for physicians and researchers to adhere to, in order to protect the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, dignity and privacy of patients and research subjects. With the development of new technologies, the right to privacy has gained a new perspective; the right to protection of personal data within <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies. The right to data protection has been attributed an increasing importance within EU law. Accordingly, the use of health data in medical research in general and in biobank-related medical research in particular, has made data protection law highly relevant. In medical research involving biobanks, transferring human biological samples and/or individual health data is taking place on a daily basis. These transfers involve several oversight bodies, institutional review boards (IRBs), research ethics committees, or even data protection authorities. This article investigates the role of these national oversight bodies in the transfer of health data in cross-border research, from an EU law point of view. A special focus is laid on transfer of health data for research purposes from the EU to the US, in the light of the recently enacted EU-US Privacy Shield. The main question posed is how American oversight bodies for medical research can be expected to handle the increasingly strict EU requirements for the processing of health data in medical research review.</p>

<p>Virtual spaces to help learn a language or write autonomously have become common and are only likely to increase. Multiple resources can be placed on a site easily accessible 24/7 and computer mediated communication in various forms can supply needed human interaction spaces. But how are these sites used by the local students? Following the path of several individuals in detail can allow more understanding and depth of the precise usage of space. This paper tracks two Arab students exploring and using a newly formed online self-access centre (SAC) for writing or online writing lab (OWL) for the best part of a semester. As an exploratory action research study, it was data driven and multiple data sources were mainly unobtrusive so that the study could proceed very naturally. The choices, learning style, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> types and personality differences between the two students suggest a range of support is ideal in an online SAC to cater for individuals in this context, including resources, how to learn, 1-1 asynchronous with advisor (<span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s), forums, electronic writing raters, and a high profile test. Ongoing action research should help to keep the online facility relevant to needs and open to new ways.</p>

<p>David Barry Gaspar and Darlene Clark Hine, eds., Beyond Bondage: Free Women of Color in the Americas, Champaign, Illinois: University of Illinois Press, 2004, xi + 329 pp.Building on the success of More Than <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Chat</span>tel: Black Women and Slavery in the Americas (1996), their edited volume of essays on and enslaved black women, David Barry Gaspar and Darlene Clark Hine have collected another impressive set of essays analysing the lives of women in slave-based societies from across the Americas in their new, and in many ways complementary, volume. This remarkably balanced set of articles discusses women’s lives in a wide range of geographic settings, from Antigua west to New Orleans and from Kentucky south to Brazil; in rural and urban settings; and under a variety of imperial regimes, including Spanish, French, British and US. Comparisons among the conditions of women of colour are further enhanced by the chronological span of this book, beginning in the seventeenth century and continuing to the middle of the nineteenth.The breadth of coverage permits the reader to consider the lives and experiences of women of colour and, even more, to reconsider the very concepts of freedom and bondage. After all, how was a free woman of colour when social practices and legal restrictions still limited her self-determination? The editors conclude that women of colour could never completely escape slavery’s hold on their lives because colour prejudice, enforced by local precepts, curtailed their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, even if these restrictions occurred in different forms in the various settings represented in these essays.The editors divide the essays into two sections. The first chapters, listed under the heading Achieving and Preserving Freedom, describe the ways in which women obtained status, whether through marronage, self-purchase, lifetime or deathbed grant. In Martinique and Guadeloupe sheer laziness on the part of enslavers who demanded little or no work from their former bonds people, but also failed to complete the official procedures that would have allowed these women to enjoy documented manumission, left them in an in-between, quasifree, state as libres de fait. Documentation in other settings, such as the US South, left officially free women of colour in quasi freedom. As late as 1861, US women of colour occasionally sought to re-enslave themselves because of the limited opportunities that they were offered to support themselves and their children, or they would be forced to leave their still-enslaved family members under state laws that exiled persons of colour manumitted after specified dates. …</p>

<p>Infantile Anorexia (IA), defined by the Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood Revised (DC: 0-3R, Zero To Three, 2005), occurs when the child (a) refuses to eat adequate amounts of food for at least 1 month, and shows growth deficiency, (b) does not communicate hunger and lacks interest in food, and (c) the child’s food refusal does not follow a traumatic event and is not due to an underlying medical illness. IA usually emerges during the transition to self-feeding, when the child issues of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> are played out daily in the feeding situation. Studies evidence that the feeding interactions between children with IA and their mothers are characterized by low reciprocity, greater interactional conflict and negative affects (<span style="background-color:lightgreen">Chat</span>oor et al., 2000; Ammaniti et al., 2010, 2012). Moreover, these studies pointed out that maternal depression and eating disorders are frequently associated with IA (Cooper et al., 2004; Ammaniti et al., 2010; Lucarelli et al., 2013). To date, research has focused almost exclusively on the mother-child dyad, while fathers’ involvement, co-parental and family interactions are poorly studied. The current study is a pilot research that investigated mother-father-child triadic interactions, during feeding and play, in families with children diagnosed with IA, in comparison to families with normally developing children. Until now, at the study participated N = 10 families (five with a child with IA diagnosis and five with lack of child’s IA diagnosis, matched for child’s age and gender). The parents-child triadic interactions were assessed in feeding and play contexts using the Lausanne Trilogue Play (Fivaz-Depeursinge and Corboz-Warnery, 1999), adapted to observe father-mother-infant primary triangle in the feeding context, compared to the play context (Lucarelli et al., 2012). Families of the IA-group showed difficulties in expressing and sharing pleasure and positive affects, and in structuring a predictable and flexible context. Children showed little <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and difficulty in being actively engaged and tune with parents. Dysfunctional family interactions are a critical issue for IA that affects co-parental and family subsystems, stressing the importance of an articulated diagnostic assessment in order to target effective treatment approaches.</p>
