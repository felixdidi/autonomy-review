<p>Korean biobanks are now adapting to integrate the new paradigm of precision medicine into their fundamental role of promoting health technology. Since the enactment of Bioethics and Safety Act in 2004, the Republic of Korea has developed a regulatory framework that reflects ethical principles. However, the existing regulation of biobanks has recently proven to be limited in responding to newer ethical and legal issues that have arisen. First, as there is an emerging trend for human biospecimens to be stored, managed and distributed as digitalized data, the current role of the Distributive Review Committee may become less important compared to the Data Access Committee. Second, even if public health data is anonymized, the risk of identifiability is growing. This makes a third point relevant, informed consent is crucial to respect the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of patients and research subjects, but current consent rules need to change to reflect the interactive and dynamic communication process, in which <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) plays an increasingly prominent role. Fourth, even though data sharing for research is expected to be altruistic and the sale of human biospecimens and genome data remains prohibited, data sharing practices have become more complicated and are closer to commercial use and commercialization. Given these challenges, there is a pressing need for continuing and deeper deliberation in order to develop a more comprehensive and responsive governance framework.</p>

<p>For a decade and a half, the ways of filing and authorial intervention in web formats have invaded different spheres of action of the subjects, and have fostered behaviors of identity and cultural construction. Ways of registration and documentary organization that until recently seemed restricted to the study of institutional files, writers’ files or other ways of preservation of cultural heritage, today model the daily practices of subjects that are involved with relational processes mediated by technologies. Within the framework of this problem, our objective is to reflect on the ways of making files in the context of virtual social networks, which we consider central to understanding the dynamics of intervention of subjects and groups in the interactive digital environment. This reflection is based on a documentary analysis of the publications and user interventions in the most used social network in Argentina, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>, taking as empirical reference the last presidential campaign of 2015. The analysis is structured by considering each publication or post as a unit of content, following the principle of digital modularity. We took the 2015 presidential campaign in Argentina because, in its development, the interactive component was a key based on a premise of fundamental action arising from the analysis, which we call the imperative of the saying. This notion, within the framework of a specific publication and filing grammar, is central in order to understand strategies for capturing votes conceived from the supposed <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of users.</p>

<p>The present study aims to find out the effect of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> addiction on psychological wellbeing of adolescents studying in and around Mysuru city. A total of 720 adolescents were included in the present study, having equal number of male and female students studying in 10, 11 and 12th standards. They were administered <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction scale (Young, 1998) and Psychological wellbeing scale (Ryff, 1989). One way ANOVA was employed to find out the difference between normal, problematic and addict levels of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> on psychological wellbeing scores. Results revealed that as the levels of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> addiction increased, total psychological wellbeing scores decreased linearly and significantly. As the levels of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> addiction increased, wellbeing also decreased in specific components of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, environmental mastery, and purpose in life.</p>

<p>Abstract Together with recent technological advances in a variety of tools (such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span>, Google, YouTube), learners have been provided with freedom and openness to communicate with each other and to become proactive and independent in their learning. It is believed, however, that Asian learners seem to possess reactive <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> so that while they can organize their resources autonomously to achieve their learning goals, they are unable to take responsibility for their own learning. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to explore the factors that influence Vietnamese EFL learners’ support for or resistance to promoting learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> within a 15-week, portfolio-based writing course. The data were collected using semi-structured interviews and writing logs in this qualitative research and analyzed through content analysis. The findings showed three major factors (personal, academic, and external) supporting and resisting developing learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the portfolio-based writing course.</p>

<p>“<span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> + Education” is a hot issue in the field of education in recent years, which has raised many new questions in traditional higher education. This study took the course “Marketing Management” as an example. It analyzed the challenges and opportunities for this course in the era of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. Based on the analysis, the study gave several suggestions about the course content, teaching modes and methods, and assessment forms. It puts forward that marketing course must follow the trend of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, expand the content, innovate the teaching mode, use the diversified teaching methods, and adopt the dynamic teaching evaluation mechanisms. Then the enthusiasm and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the students could be increased, and the teaching quality could be improved.</p>

<p>Abstract Health is one of the growing sectors. Expenditure growth on average is about 2.5% a year (OECD, 2015) most notably led by the impact of ageing population. One of the areas with the fastest growth due to the “ageing-boom” is that the senior care. Technology investment is necessary to cope with the surge of patients. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things is one of those solutions. Too few studies have analyzed the organizational impact of these technologies. We propose a model confounding organizational perspective and anthropology. We seek to understand how the diversity of technological tools can give meaning to their implementation in the organization. Based on experts’ statements and analysing weak signals, we suggest three trends: the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things strengthens patients’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>; it fights against the negative image of Senior care and ensures continuity between homecare services and institutionalization. The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things strengthens the bureaucratic aspect of Senior care, which in certain respects sound like highly bureaucratic organization where control becomes dominant. The duty of monitoring, control and transparency is enhanced by disempowering professionals and changing the tasks of Senior care directors whose supervisory task has grown major. The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things can strengthen an opposite organizational model based on technical and human networks.</p>

<p>Recent advances in the areas of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the informatics field, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span>-Physical Systems (CPS) in the production field, and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things (IoT) in the logistics and transportation field have induced a tremendous growth and innovation potential for global value chain setups. The question is not if further innovation and automation will happen but when—sooner than later—and how. Independent of physical production innovations (additive manufacturing) the information integration and decision <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> tendencies themselves will drive new supply chain and customer interaction designs and business models. This article presents a technology forecast model based on extensive descriptions of developments by field as well as interaction traits. Results suggest that the crucial element in AI and technology application in logistics will be the human factor and human-artificial cooperation capacities and attitudes.</p>

<p>The development of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies (ICTs) has facilitated the emergence of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span>culture. With it, the debate about the dissolution of the border between the public and the private approached the concepts of anonymity and privacy. This article attempts to evaluate under what conditions it is possible (or not) to accept this approach and to consider anonymity as a(n) (i)legitimate practice in the field of social relations mediated by ICTs. Developed from a bibliographical review, the work was structured in two parts. The first, part deals with the concept of freedom as an expression of individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and addresses the question of the name as a constituent element of existence in society. The second, part explores the concept of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>culture and the various manifestations and motivations related to anonymity.</p>

<p>Based on the status growth of professional development of future specialists when studying at higher educational establishments, the author of the article outlined the tasks designed to solve the specifics of the approach to independent work organization in the professional training process of future teachers of the first (Bachelor) level of higher education by example of studying profile and practical disciplines. The emphasis is made on a number of new tasks related to the education content update. Implementation of the function of deliberate development management lies in a combination of traditional education with modern electronic technologies. Therefore, in order to achieve the training objectives (the expected application of acquired competencies) and improve the quality of education, a student must master existing forms of self-education. The practicability of using electronic means in educational activities has been proved as most students are active <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and programs users that help to interest them, concentrate students’ attention on studying new material, motivate their active cognitive activity. Since it is a priority task of modern higher education establishments to create pedagogical conditions for the identification and development of students’ abilities, satisfaction of their needs and interests, formation of competences, development of educational and cognitive activity and creative <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, purposeful regulation of independence development is carried out in the process of educational interaction by helping to form creative student activity experience. The pedagogical aspect of students’ motivation for independent cognitive activity has also been analyzed in the article by the author. It has been proved that the formation of educational motives is directly proportional to the success and further individual development as a future specialist.</p>

<p>ICT plays a vital role in English language learning since it boosts motivation (Schoepp &amp; Erogul, 2001), learners’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (Tri. et al., 2014) and learning skills (Galavis, 1998). This study aimed to examine the effects of ICT-based learning using wiki on learning of students’ vocabulary mastery at the junior high school. The design of the present study was quasi-experimental study. The population of the study was seventh graders of a junior high school in Bandung. Experimental group and control group comprised of 25 students each. The instruments of the study were a pre-test and a post-test of vocabulary mastery and an online learning platform called wiki. The data were analyzed by SPSS 16.0 for the windows. The findings revealed that there were significant differences at .05 level between experimental group and control group (df= 49, t= 2.02). Furthermore, recommendations are proposed for the teachers whose teaching philosophy is twisted with ICT-based learning. For instance, they should provide an interesting topic on the wiki, let them <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> while working online, assign them working at home and well prepare the facilities used in the class before starting of the lesson.</p>

<p>Nonstandard work schedules have important consequences for workers in the new economy. Using unique data on the work times of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>-based freelancers, specifically, self-employed professionals participating in a Russian-language online labor market (N = 4,280), the authors find that working at night has adverse effects on workers’ subjective well-being as measured by satisfaction with work–life balance, life satisfaction, and emotional exhaustion. Night work has differential effects on freelancers’ well-being based on gender, partnership status, and caregiving responsibilities. Highlighting the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> paradox, the authors’ findings document how freelancers’ discretionary application of a flexible schedule to work at night consequently undermines their well-being.</p>

<p>Prior research indicates that many people wish to limit aspects of their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use. Why is it that certain <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use feels so meaningless? We examined this question by using interviews, the experience sampling method, and mobile logging of 86,402 sessions of app use. One motivation for use (habitual use to pass the time) and two types of use (entertainment and passive <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>) were associated with a lower sense of meaningfulness. In interviews, participants reported feeling a loss of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> when using their phone in these ways. These reports were corroborated by experience sampling data showing that motivation to achieve a specific purpose declined over the course of app use, particularly for passive <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and entertainment usage. In interviews, participants pointed out that even when <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use itself was meaningless, it could sometimes still be meaningful in the context of broader life as a ‘micro escape’ from negative situations. We discuss implications for how mobile apps can be used and designed to reduce meaningless experiences.</p>

It presents data on the creation and the creation chronology of party foundations, its organizational structure (websites, offices, sectors, tasks/roles divisions; requirements of various experts, products such as books, magazines, courses, incomes; etc.) from information available on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> as well as the social, political and cultural profiles of its presidents and former presidents. It was also examined the case of the Perseu Abramo Foundation of the Workers Party.</p>

<p>This study investigates the impact of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICT) on worker <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and monitoring using the second wave of the German Linked Personnel Panel, a linked employer-employee data set. From a theoretical point of view, the impact of ICT on workplace organization is ambigu- ous. On the one hand, the fast diffusion of ICT among employees makes it possible to monitor professional activities, leading to greater centralization. On the other hand, ICT enable employees to work more autonomously, so that workplace organization becomes more decentralized. Based on ordinary least squares and instrumental variable estimates, we find that ICT promotes both centralization and decentralization tendencies. Furthermore, managerial employees are more affected by ICT-induced monitoring and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> than their non-managerial counterparts. Finally, the effect of digital ICT on employee <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is more pronounced than the corresponding effect on employee monitoring. Again, this does especially hold for managerial employees. All in all, our results support the view that unlike prior technological revolutions digitalization primarily affects the employment prospects and working conditions of employees at medium and higher hierarchical levels.</p>

<p>This descriptive type of cross sectional study was carried out to observe the hospital educational environment of selected postgraduate medical institutes of Bangladesh. Study period was from July 2016 to June 2017.Sample size was 289 postgraduate clinical students of various course (MD, FCPS &amp; Diploma) and 20 clinical teachers of 10 selected postgraduate medical institutes of Bangladesh. Convenience sampling technique was adopted. Data collection was done with self- administered semi-structured questionnaire using Postgraduate Hospital Educational Environment Measurement (PHEEM) inventory and by In-depth interview of teachers. Three subscales of PHEEM are students’ perceptions about ‘role <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>’, students’ perceptions about quality of teaching and students’ perceptions about social support. In-depth interview of the clinical teachers was undertaken to explore the training facilities in the selected postgraduate medical institutes of Bangladesh. Study result revealed total PHEEM score was110.08.Mean score of subscales of PHEEM were 34.51, 36.29 and 26.28 for ‘role <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>’, quality of teaching and social support respectively. All these values indicates that the students’ perception were in the right or positive direction. Analysis of individual items had shown mean score of most of the individual item were 2-3 that indicated the aspects of the climate that could be enhanced. There were few items that had mean score 2 or less than 2 that indicated the problematic areas of hospital educational environment. In-depth interview of the teachers revealed that there was also some problematic issues on postgraduate training facilities like work overload, lack of proper monitoring or supervision of training, inadequate library, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>, ICU and investigation facilities etc. Study recommended that significant attention should be paid in the problematic areas (lack of supervised training, heavy work load of student, lack of library facility etc.) as well as improvement needed on several areas of hospital educational environment of postgraduate medical institutes of Bangladesh.

<p>Local Government in England: Centralisation, <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> and Control is a serious book and an important contribution to the scholarship around local government. It opens however, with a pleasingly comic tableau as academics from England, Portugal and Poland bicker amiably at a conference and on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span> about whose country is really the most centralised. The rest of the book is devoted to showing why the English academics were right, why it matters and what should be done about it.
 
 The main thrust of the text is an analysis of the impact of the dominant policy narratives around centralism and localism. The argument that Copus, Wall and Roberts put forward could be boiled down to the assertion that the problem with local government in England is that it is neither local nor government. But to make this case they first helpfully unpack several sets of concepts that are all too often elided together.</p>

To reach the purpose, it was done a bibliographical exploratory-explanatory search, qualitative, using the deductive method. As a search result, in summary, it has that, therefore in certain and specific situations, surely, the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> can favor the social isolation, since used according with the dictates recommended by common sense, with parsimony and respecting the limits of legality, can favor the socialization of individuals, and promote the improvement of their decisional <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.

<p>Moral critiques of computational algorithms seem divided between two paradigms. One seeks to demonstrate how an opaque and unruly algorithmic power violates moral values and harms users’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>; the other underlines the systematicity of such power, deflating concerns about opacity and unruliness. While the second paradigm makes it possible to think of end users of algorithmic systems as moral agents, the consequences of this possibility remain unexplored. This article proposes one way of tackling this problem. Employing Michel Foucault’s version of virtue ethics, I examine how perceptions of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>’s normative regulation of visibility have transformed non-expert end users’ ethical selves (i.e., their character) in the current political crisis in Brazil. The article builds on this analysis to advance algorithmic ethical subjectivation as a concept to make sense of these processes of ethical becoming. I define them as plural (encompassing various types of actions and values, and resulting in no determinate subject), contextual (demanding not only sociomaterial but also epistemological and ethical conditions), and potentially harmful (eventually structuring harms that are not externally inflicted by algorithms, but by users, upon themselves and others, in response to how they perceive the normativity of algorithmic decisions). By researching which model(s) of ethical subjectivation specific algorithmic social platforms instantiate, critical scholars might be able to better understand the normative consequences of these platforms’ power.</p>

<p>Semantic interaction in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things (IoT) is an important concept within current IoT development, given that smart things require further <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> with greater processing, storage, and communication capacities. The problem is now becoming one of how to get these things to interact and collaborate with each other; to form intelligent environments amongst themselves and thus generate better services for users. This article explores a solution approach that consists in providing collaborative behavior to smart things, through the incorporation of an ontology and an architecture. It makes possible things that can communicate and collaborate with each other, allowing the generation of new services of interaction according to user needs. For this task, a real test bed of smart things was created, in which the proposed solution was deployed (Smart Room). Finally, it was concluded that the creation of these types of test bed is feasible, taking into account that response times and the information delivered by the different managed processes are acceptable. New challenges were encountered, however, such as problems of critical region in test beds with conflicting services and management of multiple users.</p>

<p>Recently, the scientific community has demonstrated a special interest in the process related to the integration of the agent-oriented technology with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things (IoT) platforms. Then, it arises a novel approach named <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Agents (IoA) as an alternative to add an intelligence and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> component for IoT devices and networks. This paper presents an analysis of the main benefits derived from the use of the IoA approach, based on a practical point of view regarding the necessities that humans demand in their daily life and work, which can be solved by IoT networks modeled as IoA infrastructures. It has been presented 24 study cases of the IoA approach at different domains ––smart industry, smart city and smart health wellbeing–– in order to define the scope of these proposals in terms of intelligence and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in contrast to their corresponding generic IoT applications.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION. The change of approach advocated by the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFRL), implemented by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>y (ICT), has led to the Electronic European Language Portfolio (eELP). This new model involves a change in methodology, which benefits from new ways of managing information and interacting with the personal learning environment. METHOD. This article analyzes the development of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> through the eELP by using data collected in a qualitative study conducted on a group of students studying German (level A2.1 of the CEFRL) of the Official School of Languages of Alicante (Spain) between October 2016 and February 2017. The purpose of this study is to analyze the progression of the students in three subsections of the section Learning to learn of the eELP: Reflection and organization, Learning the new and Fixing the learned. RESULTS . If we analyze the results, we conclude that the eELP has encouraged the change of focus from the teacher to the student. Likewise, meaningful learning has meant that the activities have had to be adapted to the student in regards to goals, content and tasks, thus responding to the needs of the learner, so that it has been possible to integrate and restructure these activities in their world of experiences. DISCUSSION . The motivation of all the students has increased and they have developed confidence in themselves thanks to the positive formulation of their capacities through rubrics. In spite of the progress in <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, the implementation time has been insufficient to develop all the capacities that integrate autonomous learning.</p>

<p>The current study takes a qualitative approach to examining the unique use of mobile communications in romantic relationships among young Chinese adults, a research field few scholars have evinced interest in at this point in time (Lim &amp; Soriano, 2016: p.&nbsp;4). The overarching question “What is the ‘Chinese-ness’ of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> user culture of young romantic couples regarding perpetual contact, boundary maintenance, and the connectedness-<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> tension?” was answered by 15 semi-structured individual interviews. The findings suggest that 1) <span style="background-color:lightgreen">WeChat</span> messaging was the most prominent mobile media platform used by the respondents to stay in “perpetual contact”, i.e., defined as a continuous conversation through frequent short messages between individuals not physically in the same location (Katz &amp; Aakhus, 2002: p.&nbsp;2). The interviewees wished to protect their relationship a couple by not disclosing too much or by preventing others from prying too far into it. 3) Respondents resolved the tension between the needs to connect with each other and to remain independent individuals by adopting the former approach. Respondents frequently practiced perpetual contact, supporting the Apparatgeist theory, which views <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s as mystical devices that allow constant communication with unseen others, combined with the collective construction of meaning (Katz &amp; Aakhus, 2002). This current study further discusses relevant theoretical and social implications.</p>

<p>We propose a venture into an existential opportunity for establishing a world ‘good enough’ for humans to live in. Defining an existential opportunity as the converse of an existential risk—that is, a development that promises to dramatically improve the future of humanity—we argue that one such opportunity is available and should be explored now. The opportunity resides in the moment of transition of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>—from mediating information to mediating distributed direct governance in the sense of self-organization. The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of tomorrow will mediate the execution of contracts, transactions, public interventions and all other change-establishing events more reliably and more synergistically than any other technology or institution. It will become a distributed, synthetically intelligent agent in itself. This transition must not be just observed, or exploited instrumentally: it must be ventured into and seized on behalf of entire humanity. We envision a configuration of three kinds of cognitive system—the human mind, social systems and the emerging synthetic intelligence—serving to augment the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the first from the ‘programming’ imposed by the second. Our proposition is grounded in a detailed analysis of the manner in which the socio-econo-political system has evolved into a powerful control mechanism that subsumes human minds, steers their will and automates their thinking. We see the venture into the existential opportunity described here as aiming at the global dissolution of the core reason of that programming’s effectiveness—the critical dependence of the continuity of human lives on the coherence of the socially constructed personas they ‘wear.’ Thus, we oppose the popular prediction of the upcoming, ‘dreadful AI takeover’ with a call for action: instead of worrying that Artificial Intelligence will soon come to dominate and govern the human world, let us think of how it could help the human being to finally be able to do it.</p>

<p>Nowadays, schools in Mexico have financial <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to invest in infrastructure, although they must adjust their spending to national education projects. This represents a challenge, since it is complex to predict the effectiveness that an ICT (<span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>y) project will have in certain areas of the country that do not even have the necessary infrastructure to start up. To address this problem, it is important to provide schools with a System for Technological Management (STM), that allows them to identify, select, acquire, adopt and assimilate technologies. In this paper, the implementation of a quantitative model applied to a STM is presented. The quantitative model employs parameters of schools, regarding basic infrastructure such as essential services, computer devices, and connectivity, among others. The results of the proposed system are presented, where from the 5 possible points for the correct transfer, only 3.07 are obtained, where the highest is close to 0.88 with the availability of electric energy and the lowest is with the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> connectivity and availability with a 0.36 and 0.39 respectively which can strongly condition the success of the program.</p>

This paper proposes an agent-based approach to distributed control for production environments in which the agents are only able to interact with a part of the whole system. It hypothesises that the performance of the agent network can be improved through learning and communication. A description of the approach is presented and illustrated with a simulation case of distributed control for an industrial compressed-air system.</p>

<p>This article presents a pedagogical strategy for the education of journalists in higher education. Its main characteristic is that it occurs mainly on the social web, with the students sharing their journalistic productions in a collective blog and discussing their work on a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> page. The strategy also aims at developing the sense of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and democratic participation of the students and their awareness of the values and practices of the profession. The strategy is the culmination of a three-cycle action-research project, developed over a period of five years, on how to educate journalists through innovative learning experiences based on new technologies. We believe that both the strategy and the research that led to it may be inspiring to educators and researchers concerned with the challenges of education on the social web.</p>

<p>Background To date, scholars have mainly focused on tailoring the content of online health communication, yet effect sizes remain small. To increase its public health impact, testing strategies that might increase the effectiveness of online computer-tailoring is a priority. The aim of this study is to explore the potential of message frame tailoring, by identifying the most <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive message frame within an online health communication intervention aimed at the promotion of vegetable intake.</p>
<p>Methods Two strategies will be studied that have been found to increase perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-support in the face-to-face setting, i.e.&nbsp;offering choice and using non-controlling language. A 2 (choice vs.&nbsp;no choice) x 2 (non- controlling vs.&nbsp;controlling language) experiment will be conducted. Participants (N=492) will be recruited via a research panel and will be randomly assigned to one of the conditions. Measurements will occur before (T0; demographics, present behaviour) and directly post-intervention (T1; perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-support).</p>
<p>Expected results It is hypothesized that both offering choice and using non-controlling language increase perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-support, but that the combination is most effective.</p>
<p>Current stage of work Currently, intervention materials have been adjusted for use in each of the four conditions. Next steps will entail pre-testing among experts and the target population, finalizing intervention materials and data collection (expected in April-May 2017).</p>
<p>Discussion The results from this study will contribute to the increased effectiveness of online computer-tailored health communication, a low-cost health behaviour change strategy. As the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> ensures a great reach, this increased effectiveness will improve its impact on public health.</p>

<p>This was an in-depth qualitative study that looked at the reasons patients were referred to the Clinical Ethics Committee (CEC) of an acute hospital in Singapore and explore how the CEC approached cases referred. Jonsen’s four topics approach was applied in the deliberative process for all cases. A comprehensive review of the case records of 28 patients referred consecutively to the CEC from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2014 was conducted. Data and information was collated from the referral forms, patient medical records, and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s communicated among CEC members. A deductive approach to thematic analysis based on Jonsen’s four topics approach was used to analyze the documents. Majority of the patients were male (94%), Chinese (76%), and above 65&nbsp;years of age (41%). Ethical dilemmas surfaced due to differences in opinion regarding withholding of aggressive management (53%), withdrawing treatment (35%), and ascertaining patient’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (12%). In most cases, the patients’ preference on end-of-life care was unknown (82%). The main reasons for referral to the CEC were conflicts in clinical management and uncertainty about the decision-making capacity of patients. The CEC members tended to emphasize on “patient preference” more than the other quadrants in the four topics approach as they worked through each case. The Jonsen’s four topics approach lays the groundwork to frame ethical dilemmas that can be easily applied in the clinical setting and is a useful tool for the CEC’s teaching and discussion. Nonetheless, the approach only organizes ethical dilemmas and requires clinicians to apply own judgment in weighing ethical principles. Further studies can look into adapting the four topics approach to suit the local practices and context.</p>

<p>Summary The article presents a scientific analysis of a practical application of multilingual and multicultural education at higher education, more specifically, the description of the eTandem project developed and launched by the Language Center of the University of Padua, which won the European Language Label (ELL) in December 2016. The project was selected and nominated since it provides a methodological approach and study strategies which favour multilingualism, mobility for young people and inclusiveness. The project is based on an online exchange between Italian students enrolled at the University of Padua and international students who will be coming to the University. It differs from many other telecollaboration projects in that it involves different languages, levels of language competence as well as various ways of interaction. Indeed, it implies three different ways of communication among participants: (1) one-to-one partnership in the students’ target language; (2) many-to-many interaction in Italian and/or English/French/Spanish as linguae francae on a Moodle platform and/or in a social <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> area; (3) one-to-many multilingual interaction carried out by e-tutors in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>. They provide students with useful links regarding cultural events and things to do in Padua and its surroundings, as well as recent news and interesting linguistic and cultural issues related to different countries. Mobility, informality, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, reciprocity, friendship, fun and multilingual community are the key words of this initiative whose objectives are aimed at developing linguistic, cultural, personal, social and digital skills in different languages, even in the less used and less taught ones.</p>

<p>The demand of responsibilities among teachers has evolved not only in classroom management but also to the extent of promoting communication and interpersonal skills. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social media</span> is integrated in schools and higher learning institutions for communication and reflection of learning which enhance teachers’ performance in leadership quality and effective teaching. This study was designed in a qualitative approach mainly to explore the extent of interest and enjoyment students experienced during an intensive ICT course. Blog was used as a medium for reflection during the class where students posted their creations of videos, posters and other ICT materials. The three needs investigated were namely <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness support. The researcher further examined on students’ awareness of the usefulness of the ICT skill they learned and how much they can use the blog for teaching and learning. Based on the Basic Psychological Needs Theory framework (BPNT), this study has adopted the direct observation, journal entry, and interviews as a triangulation approach.</p>

<p>Commercial genetic testing offered over the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>, known as direct-to-consumer genetic testing (DTC GT), currently is under ethical attack. A common critique aims at the limited validation of the tests as well as the risk of psycho-social stress or adaption of incorrect behavior by users triggered by misleading health information. Here, we examine in detail the specific role of advertising communication of DTC GT companies from a medical ethical perspective. Our argumentative analysis departs from the starting point that DTC GT operates at the intersection of two different contexts: medicine on the one hand and the market on the other. Both fields differ strongly with regard to their standards of communication practices and the underlying normative assumptions regarding <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and responsibility. Following a short review of the ethical contexts of medical and commercial communication, we provide case examples for persuasive messages of DTC GT websites and briefly analyze their design with a multi-modal approach to illustrate some of their problematic implications. We observe three main aspects in DTC GT advertising communication: (1) the use of material suggesting medical professional legitimacy as a trust-establishing tool, (2) the suggestion of empowerment as a benefit of using DTC GT services and (3) the narrative of responsibility as a persuasive appeal to a moral self-conception. While strengthening and respecting the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of a patient is the focus in medical communication, specifically genetic counselling, persuasive communication is the normal mode in marketing of consumer goods, presuming an autonomous, rational, independent consumer. This creates tension in the context of DTC GT regarding the expectation and normative assessment of communication strategies. Our analysis can even the ground for a better understanding of ethical problems associated with intersections of medical and commercial communication and point to perspectives of analysis of DTC GT advertising.</p>

<p>With the evolution of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of things and smart cities, a new trend of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of simulation has emerged to utilise the technologies of cloud, edge, fog computing, and high-performance computing for design and analysis of complex <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-physical systems using simulation. These technologies although being applied to the domains of big data and deep learning are not adequate to cope with the scale and complexity of emerging connected, smart, and autonomous systems. This study explores the existing state-of-the-art in automating, augmenting, and integrating systems across the domains of smart cities, autonomous vehicles, energy efficiency, smart manufacturing in Industry 4.0, and healthcare. This is expanded to look at existing computational infrastructure and how it can be used to support these applications. A detailed review is presented of advances in approaches providing and supporting intelligence as a service. Finally, some of the remaining challenges due to the explosion of data streams; issues of safety and security; and others related to big data, a model of reality, augmentation of systems, and computation are examined.</p>

<p>The industry development over the last hundred years has had a huge impact on the development of technological infrastructure and life change. Three main components of this development are related to personalization: a car as a personal vehicle and greater personal freedom; a personal computer as a means of intellectual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>; a personal phone as a means of freedom of communication and access to information. These three development factors significantly changed the employee psychology and created the conditions for diffusion of qualitatively new, synthesized (<span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-physical) technologies that became the basis of the Industry 4.0 and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things – two main working concepts of industrial and infrastructural development for the next 20 years. The conventional or classical industrial systems that are dominant to the present day have mainly been based on the principles of human muscle energy replacement, but the technological changes of our days raise the question of the substantial scale of displacement of the living manpower both in production and in management and services. The process of technological and industrial transformation that has already begun will inevitably lead to the transformation of social and economic systems, and here the key problem will not only be the provision of a new quality of economic growth, but also the solution of the employment problem interfacing a new technological platform, the information and social infrastructure of society.</p>

<p>This paper explores and rehabilitates the value of decisional privacy as a conceptual tool, complementary to informational privacy, for critiquing personalized choice architectures employed by self-tracking technologies. Self-tracking technologies are promoted and used as a means to self-improvement. Based on large aggregates of personal data and the data of other users, self-tracking technologies offer personalized feedback that nudges the user into behavioral change. The real-time personalization of choice architectures requires continuous surveillance and is a very powerful technology, recently coined as “hypernudging.” While users celebrate the increased personalization of their coaching devices, “hypernudging” technologies raise concerns about manipulation. This paper addresses that intuition by claiming that decisional privacy is at stake. It thus counters the trend to solely focus on informational privacy when evaluating <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies. It proposes that decisional privacy and informational privacy are often part of a mutually reinforcing dynamic. Hypernudging is used as a key example to illustrate that the two dimensions should not be treated separately. Hypernudging self-tracking technologies compromise <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> because they violate informational and decisional privacy. In order to effectively judge whether technologies that use hypernudges empower users, we need both privacy dimensions as conceptual tools.</p>

<p>This Essay argues that the battle over women’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, especially their reproductive healthcare and decision-making, has always been about much more than simply women’s health and safety. Rather, upholding patriarchy and dominion over women’s reproduction historically served political purposes and entrenched social and cultural norms that framed women’s capacities almost exclusively as service to a husband, mothering, reproducing, and sexual <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>tel. In turn, such social norms—often enforced by statutes and legal opinions—took root in rhetoric rather than the realities of women’s humanity, experiences, capacities, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and lived lives. As such, law created legal fictions about women and their supposed lack of intellectual and social capacities. Law trapped women to the destinies courts and legislatures aspired for them and continues to do so. This Essay turns to the less engaged international sphere and the copious Congressional Record to unpack how the Helms Amendment and later, the Mexico City Policy (or Global Gag Rule), emerged from this type of lawmaking. This Essay shows how these harmful dictates on women’s lives and bodies in developing nations result in a deadly rise of illegal abortions, criminal punishments, stigmatization, and sadly, deaths.</p>

<p>Innovating practices on the network at university education are considered with great interest, but there are academic areas where it is more difficult to implement them. Therefore, our goal was to bring them to teaching practice, using ubiquitous systems, in a Postgraduate Humanities. We assume that it could be a new way of learning not only contents, but also digital tools, and these competences would help students to acquire and important <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> degree on the management of virtual resources, which would also be of great usefulness on the working market. To achieve it, we chose the platforms with greater use and adaptability, such as Wordpress for blogs and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span> for social networks. The results of the surveys confirm the high level of satisfaction on the part of the students and the perception that with this system they have learned in a different way.</p>

<p>This paper analyses the persuasiveness of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> push notifications. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> push notifications are conceptualized as starting point of a chain of persuasive offerings. A push notification is successful, i.e.&nbsp;has high persuasiveness when adressed users react on it, enter the platform and stay longer in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> push notifications as well as entertainment and media offerings of the platform result in an escapist consumtion of the offered content by the platform.

<p>Health Care becomes the communication system within digital economy. This fact causes the extraordinary complexity in Health Care management. Artificial Intelligence technologies have a basic feature that is self-governing, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in decision-making. Artificial Intelligence’s self-governing is a challenge at the population level, which requires to build the right digital architectonics. This issue concerns not only diagnostics and treatment of diseases, but also the accessibility of medical services for population. It is necessary to broader consider the role of Health Care in common economic structure of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things, and create an anthropocentric infrastructure, in which all types of digital transactions will be included in co-financing of Health Care. This measure wouldn’t allow to separate medical services from all segments of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things, otherwise Health Care financing would be critically cut. The multifunctional cards, such as the «Mir» card, is the first step towards digital integration.

<p>Background: According to the Self-determination Theory, psychological need satisfaction and gaming motives are potentially salient factors of behavioural addictions such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> gaming disorder (IGD). This study examined the mediating role of gaming motives on in-game psychological need satisfaction (i.e., <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span>, Competence, and Relatedness) and IGD tendency. Methods: Chinese adult online gamers (N=383) were recruited and completed an online anonymous questionnaire survey. The questionnaire was composed of Player Experience of Need Satisfaction (for assessing In-game competence, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and relatedness), Motive for Online Gaming Questionnaire (for assessing General, Escape, Coping, Fantasy, Skill Development, Recreation, Competition, and Social motives), DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for IGD, and demographic items. With demographic items included as controlled variables, the path analysis using Mplus 7.4 was conducted to predict Rasch-scaled IGD tendency score from the DSM-5 criteria. Findings: In our path model, in-game need satisfaction was significantly related to gaming motives. For example, In-game relatedness was positively associated with Social (β=.43) and negatively related to Recreation and Competition (β = −.20 and −.17). All three types of need satisfaction were positively associated with General Motivation (β range= .23-.30). The significant, direct risk factors for IGD included male gender, In-game <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, General Motivation, and Escape motive (β range= .17-.26), while Skill Development and Recreation motives (β = −.16 and −.10) were protective factors. Discussion: Our findings suggested gaming motives mediating the effect of psychological need satisfaction on IGD tendency. Future intervention programs should also take specific psychological risk factors such as perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and Escape motive into account.</p>

<p>Personal AI assistants are now nearly ubiquitous. Every leading <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> operating system comes with a personal AI assistant that promises to help you with basic cognitive tasks: searching, planning, messaging, scheduling and so on. Usage of such devices is effectively a form of algorithmic outsourcing: getting a smart algorithm to do something on your behalf. Many have expressed concerns about this algorithmic outsourcing. They claim that it is dehumanising, leads to cognitive degeneration, and robs us of our freedom and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Some people have a more subtle view, arguing that it is problematic in those cases where its use may degrade important interpersonal virtues. In this article, I assess these objections to the use of AI assistants. I will argue that the ethics of their use is complex. There are no quick fixes or knockdown objections to the practice, but there are some legitimate concerns. By carefully analysing and evaluating the objections that have been lodged to date, we can begin to articulate an ethics of personal AI use that navigates those concerns. In the process, we can locate some paradoxes in our thinking about outsourcing and technological dependence, and we can think more clearly about what it means to live a good life in the age of smart machines.</p>

<p>ABSTRACTThe current study examined the role of parental media mediation styles in the relationships between (1) pro<span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> content and the performance of prosocial behavior and (2) anti<span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> content and the performance of antisocial behavior. The results of a cross-sectional survey (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;475; Mage&nbsp;=&nbsp;14.6) indicated that <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive restrictive mediation was positively related to prosocial behavior through increased pro<span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> exposure, while it was also associated with less antisocial behavior through decreased anti<span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> content exposure. <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span>-supportive active mediation on the other hand strengthened the positive association between exposure to pro<span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> content and the performance of prosocial behavior. However, this type of mediation did not moderate the association between exposure to anti<span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> content and the performance of antisocial behavior. These results indicate that <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive mediation styles are most effective in managing media effects,…</p>

<p>This review paper presents the Entropy approach to modeling and performance evaluation of Intelligent Machines (IMs), which are modeled as hierarchical, multi-level structures. It provides a chronological summary of developments related to intelligent control, from its origins to current advances. It discusses fundamentals of the concept of Entropy as a measure of uncertainty and as a control function, which may be used to control, evaluate and improve through adaptation and learning performance of engineering systems. It describes a multi-level, hierarchical, architecture that is used to model such systems, and it defines <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and machine intelligence for engineering systems, with the aim to set foundations necessary to tackle related challenges. The modeling philosophy for the systems under consideration follows the mathematically proven principle of Increasing Precision with Decreasing Intelligence (IPDI). Entropy is also used in the context of N-Dimensional Information Theory to model the flow of information throughout such systems and contributes to quantitatively evaluate uncertainty, thus, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and intelligence. It is explained how Entropy qualifies as a unique, single, measure to evaluate <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, intelligence and precision of task execution. The main contribution of this review paper is that it brings under one forum research findings from the 1970’s and 1980’s, and that it supports the argument that even today, given the unprecedented existing computational power, advances in Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning and Control Theory, the same foundational framework may be followed to study large-scale, distributed <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span> Physical Systems (CPSs), including distributed intelligence and multi-agent systems, with direct applications to the SmartGrid, transportation systems and multi-robot teams, to mention but a few applications.</p>

<p>Abstract Research has revealed that the push to engage in video games is in part the perception that they satisfy three basic psychological needs (competence, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, relatedness). However, the pull toward a problematic style of video game engagement based on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> Gaming Disorder symptomatology has been found to be explained in part by the daily frustration of these same needs. Currently, these two areas of gaming research have been conducted within separate studies. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to bridge these two theoretically compatible areas of research in exploring the interaction between gaming need satisfaction and daily need frustration in explaining problem video game use and gaming frequency. An online sample of 922 adults (59.1% males; Mage = 23.53 years; SD = 6.84) were recruited. Results revealed both gaming need satisfaction and daily need frustration positively contributed to gaming frequency and problem video game use accounting for 19.7% and 23.5% of their respective variances. Furthermore, gaming frequency and problem video game use were highest when both gaming need satisfaction and daily need frustration were high. The implications of these results are discussed within the context of current research and strengths-based clinical approaches.</p>

<p>The aim of the article is the formation of an innovative model for the commercialization of the services of scientific libraries of research universities in order to increase their financial <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The methodology of the research is based on the use of methods: scientific generalization, systematization, comparison, modelling. The object of research is the activity of scientific libraries of research universities, which strive to vary in the current conditions of rapid technological development. The research results consist of the systematization of the main and secondary functions of scientific libraries of research universities. A new economic category of “digital franchising” has been proposed and characterized as a model of cooperation between the franchisor and the franchisee when the rights to use and represent the company of the franchisor in the intercontinental digital space are transferred. The franchisee has the right to use the company name, services, goods, technological processes, and software of the franchisor to create its own digital network of sub-franchisees and digital products on the basis of the conditions specified in the contract. Such kind of franchising will allow settling relations in a digital <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>space, promptly developing and getting new, yet not completely studied forms. Comparison of traditional and digital models of franchising has allowed to show differences on ten basic criteria: costs for building a network; speed of interaction; level of managerial flexibility; updating of the system; the possibility of expanding the network; financial control; brand management; rate of return; the speed of information about new services; need for operational management. The revealed discrepancies are mainly characterized by different time frames for implementing managerial decisions and excellent approaches to the formation and use of the necessary financial and organizational resources. The author has developed an innovative franchise model, which makes it possible to effectively commercialize the services of scientific libraries. This model is based on the use of franchising by building a broad network of digital services. The peculiarity of digital franchising is revealed, which consists in the essential optimization of expenses for organizing the activities of scientific libraries, in comparison with the traditional model, and speeding up the pace and quality of service. The practical significance of the obtained results lies in new opportunities for pushing a new wave of development of methods for commercializing the services of scientific libraries of research universities and their dissemination at the global level. Using the developed innovative franchise model will be useful for theorists and practitioners engaged in the development of strategies for the development of research universities and their scientific libraries. The main conclusion of the research is that the introduction of a developed marketing tool by talented managers with an entrepreneurial type of thinking will become a source of financial <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for scientific libraries of research universities they manage. Digital expansion in a strategic perspective will absorb all the major information flows that affect the development of the world. Libraries of research universities, as key centres for aggregation and translation of scientific information and knowledge, should be ready for such scenario and already experiment with new tools for the future, which is digital franchising.</p>

<p>The increasing popularity of online shopping is now a global phenomenon, and China has become the largest <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> market in the world. The reasons behind this preference for online shopping are examined in this study through 63 in-depth interviews and five years of virtual ethnography of a major online shopping website— Taobao.com —in China. Chinese customers prefer Taobao not only because of price and convenience, but also because they enjoy the interactional process, during which they obtain more information, feel less pressured to put on a status performance in comparison to physical stores, and pay less affective labor. Chinese customers tend to believe that interaction with sales clerks in physical shops is a burden, and try to avoid this form of contact. This is related to the fact that consensus on status hierarchy is still yet to be established in a society that is undergoing rapid transition. Consequently, online shopping entails social interaction that attributes more power, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and freedom to customers than otherwise possible in brick-and-mortar shopping. This study shows how both the online interactional environments afforded by technology and the broader social contexts (the service quality and related aspects of status competition among different social groups in contemporary China) affect interpersonal interaction.</p>

<p>A B S T R A C T Objective : The main goal of this article is to find the answer to the questions: what is the nature of the internationalization of family businesses from Poland? Do they internationalize ad hoc or do they plan an internationalization strategy? Which resources are needed for the internationalization process? Research&nbsp;Design&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Methods : The author used qualitative approach with CATI ( Computer Assisted Telephone Interview ), PAPI ( Paper &amp; Pen Personal Interview ) and CAII ( Computer Assisted <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> Interview ) methods. 420 questionnaires were used in the statistical analysis. Findings: This study focuses on the evaluation of entrepreneurship orientation as the main resource of the internationalization nature (ad hoc or a strategic plan) of family businesses from Poland and measured it through the four elements proposed by Covin and Slevin (1989): Innovation, Proactivity, <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> and Risk. Implications&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Recommendations:&nbsp; To internationalise, family business families need to apply entrepreneurship orientation, especially proactiveness towards new challenges, and strategic planning and tools. Contribution&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Value&nbsp;Added: &nbsp;The research provides evidence of a higher degree of EO in the behaviour of a family. More successful family businesses are in international markets. They also have a challenge oriented culture, which means that such companies are oriented towards new ventures, new relations, new solutions and new markets. But they plan new challenges using the strategic approach.</p>

<p>Ageing societies and the increase in chronic disabilities are irrevocable trends in the EU which usually result in a loss of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and increased social isolation. Many people with complex disabilities face increased isolation due to loss of independent mobility because of difficulties of meeting the criteria for the provision of an Electric Powered Wheelchair (EPW) and the availability of an appropriate EPW. Several studies highlight the key role of innovative Assistive Technologies and smart EPW as effective tools to empower disabled people and improve social inclusion. Nevertheless, standardization, interoperability, limited involvement of users, lack of specialist training for health professionals and funding models are which impede the uptake of such innovations. Within this framework, a transdisciplinary consortium of French and English partners formed the 4 year ADAPT project, starting in May 2017. The aim of ADAPT is to overcome the barriers to the uptake of assistive technology. The ADAPT project aims to: - Develop two technologically mature innovative assistive technologies: * A smart EPW with driving assistance to compensate for user disabilities, to monitor and report changes users’ health through the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>. * A Virtual Reality EPW simulator platform. This will give the user an immersive experience of the smart EPW and train them to drive in everyday life. Professionals will assess the suitability of the EPW for particular patients and environments and gain understanding from the user perspective. - Develop training programs for healthcare professionals about innovative assistive technologies. - Formalize agreements between research institutions and companies ranging from local to international meetings, so as to boost R&amp;D and facilitate the uptake of the ADAPT’s results by the market. This presentation will provide an opportunity to share an overview of the ADAPT project: context, objectives and results.</p>

<p>The last decade has witnessed that education sector has dominated economic planning in all over developing countries of the world. During this time, the countries transformed from developing to advanced economies due to strategic planning and a larger vision that correlated economic development to transformation in the education sector, in particular Higher Education and Research, to become globally competitive. Despite many new National Missions/Programs and reforms agenda, by both the central and state governments with private sector intervention, the higher education sector is in a state of complete flux in India. While we have tremendously enhanced capacity, we lag in quality, given inadequate <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to our Universities. Centralized control and a standardized approach remains at the heart of regulations (FICCI, 2013). This paper, newly explains about the Rashtriya Uch<span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>ar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA)/National Higher Education Mission, a Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) for reforming the State Higher Education System in India.

<p>This article examines how musicians involved in the government sponsored music scene in Recife, the capital of the Brazilian state of Pernambuco, (meta)musically perform different versions of the ‘entrepreneurial self,’ a form of neoliberal subjectivity. Through comparing specific musicians’ practices and narratives, I argue Pernambucan state sponsorship is a mechanism which redefines citizenship on entrepreneurial terms and reinforces structural inequality. As government programs provide new opportunities to formalize and professionalize their labor, musicians face more bureaucratic and socioeconomic challenges that require them to broaden their musical labor to include skills like <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> marketing and grant proposal writing. These expectations are difficult enough for middle-class, educated musicians to meet, but even harder for marginalized, lower-class, and racialized citizens to manage. By comparing how three musicians construct themselves as business-oriented, transnational, or patrimonial entrepreneurs, the article makes explicit what similar studies suggest, but often leave implicit: professionalism and entrepreneurialism are increasingly interdependent. Furthermore, while the entrepreneurial self is predicated on <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, these musicians’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> paradoxically depends on a combination of social networks and state sponsorship. In sum, the article reveals how individuals are creating new subjectivities to adapt to changing economic conditions.</p>

<p>When facing setbacks and obstacles, the dualistic model of passion outlines that obsessive passion, and not harmonious passion, will predict greater levels of defensiveness. Our aim was to determine whether these passion dimensions predicted defensiveness in the same way when confronted with threatening messages targeting the decision to pursue a passion.Across four studies with passionate <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> users, hockey fans, and runners (total N = 763), participants viewed messages giving reasons why their favorite activity should not be pursued. Participants either reported their desire to read the messages (Studies 1 and 2) or evaluated the messages after reading them (Studies 3 and 4).Harmonious passion consistently predicted higher levels of avoidance or negative evaluations of the messages. These responses were attenuated for participants who had previously affirmed an important value (Study 1), or who were told that they do not control the passions they pursue (Study 4).Harmonious passion entails a sense of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and control over activity engagement, which usually leads to nondefensive behavior. However, this sense of control may elicit more defensive responses from more harmoniously passionate individuals when the decision itself to pursue an activity is under attack.</p>

The research used a qualitative method. The data are gathered through in-depth interviews based on a purposive sampling by including actors who have been involved in business incubations in a techno park in Indonesia. The results show that the techno park may have generally had limitations, including its process, tools, a low efficiency and a lack of financial <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Still, the incubation process has been proven to have a role in increasing the work performance of start-ups, market expansion, and improving accessibility to funding sources.

<p>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Background:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; With the increasing global population of older adults, there is a need for environmental interventions that directly affect their physical, psychological, and emotional well-being to help them maintain or regain their independence and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> – all of which promote longevity. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; To better understand potential opportunities and challenges associated with interior design and “future homes” that may promote well-being, aging in place, and independent living in older adults, the authors reviewed relevant literature and included their own expert opinions from a multidisciplinary point of view including interior design, wellness, and engineering. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; After summarizing existing environmental interventions for the aging population and their effectiveness, this review reveals knowledge gaps in interior design for the well-being and longevity of older adults followed by a discussion of opportunities for future research that may fill these gaps. Some of these opportunities include finding habilitative design strategies that identify and address unique situational needs of each user, advancing multidisciplinary fields such as environmental gerontology that recreate security and independence for older adults even outside of their homes, implementing technically advanced design strategies, which are flexible and adaptive to individual needs; and integrating the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of things (IoT) into living environments, including voice-activated command technologies to improve seniors’ central role in enabling an optimized healthcare ecosystem. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Knowledge of current evidence regarding the impact of different environmental factors may hasten adaptation of well-designed innovations that can provide optimal healing and living environments for the aging population. By effectively addressing older adults’ unique and specialized needs, design practitioners can become an indispensable part of their medical, social, and environmental team. One of the rapidly developing infrastructures promising to revolutionize the design of “future homes” is the IoT. While it is at an early stage of development, ultimately we envisage a connected home using voice-controlled technology and Bluetooth-radio-connected add-ons, to augment much of what home health does today. Bringing these approaches together into an effective strategy for a model of effective geriatric care is important and needs to become an integral part of both design education and practice.</p>

<p>In Vietnam, despite the widespread use of computers and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> in the educational settings, little attention has been paid to the role of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> in promoting students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Particularly, in the author’s real teaching context at Thuong Mai University (TMU), there exists a serious problem relating to students’ lack of independency in language learning. The study, therefore, was implemented to investigate the effectiveness of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use in promoting business learners’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and improving their learning skill. To fulfill the study, questionnaires and interviews were conducted to 200 third-year students and 10 teachers of English at TMU respectively. The qualitative approach was adopted to reveal the significant findings of the descriptive case study on the learners’ positive attitudes and awareness of their learning <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> through the popularity yet ineffective use of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use but the ineffective use of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> in improving English study and motivation, what and how teachers and learners do to promote learners’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in language learning. The study, consequently, came up with some effective pedagogical implications that may help teachers recognize the significant role of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> in enhancing learners’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> inside and outside the class.</p>

<p>A significant proportion of elderly and psychiatric patients do not have the capacity to make health care decisions. We suggest that machine learning technologies could be harnessed to integrate data mined from electronic health records (EHRs) and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> in order to estimate the confidence of the prediction that a patient would consent to a given treatment. We call this process, which takes data about patients as input and derives a confidence estimate for a particular patient’s predicted health care-related decision as an output, the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> algorithm. We suggest that the proposed algorithm would result in more accurate predictions than existing methods, which are resource intensive and consider only small patient cohorts. This algorithm could become a valuable tool in medical decision-making processes, augmenting the capacity of all people to make health care decisions in difficult situations.</p>

<p>The paper develops a needs–affordances–features (NAF) perspective on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use which posits that individuals’ psychological needs motivate their use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> applications to the extent to which these applications provide affordances that satisfy these needs. Our theoretical development builds upon two psychological theories, namely self-determination and psychological ownership, to identify five psychological needs (needs for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, relatedness, competence, having a place, and self-identity), that we posit are particularly pertinent to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use. According to NAF, these psychological needs will motivate use of those <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> applications that provide salient affordances to fulfill these needs. We identify such affordances through a comprehensive review of the literature and of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> applications and put forth propositions that map the affordances to the psychological needs that they fulfill. Our theory development generates important implications. First, it has implications for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> research in that it provides an overarching comprehensive framework for the affordances of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> as a whole and the related psychological needs that motivate their use. Future studies can leverage NAF to identify psychological needs motivating the use of specific <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> sites based on the affordances the sites provide, and design science research can leverage NAF in the design and bundling of specific <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> features to engage users. Second, it has implications for technology acceptance research in that NAF can enrich existing models by opening up the mechanisms through which psychological needs influence user perceptions of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and their use patterns and behaviors. Finally, NAF provides a new lens and common vocabulary for future studies, which we hope can stimulate cumulative research endeavors to develop a comprehensive framework of information systems affordances in general and the psychological needs that information systems satisfy.</p>

<p>In 2012, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) lifted the experimental label on oocyte preservation, but cautioned against women using it to avoid age-related infertility, known as social egg freezing (SEF). In 2014, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> and Apple announced that they would offer SEF as a workplace benefit. Within the context of a rapidly growing market for SEF, we were interested in how these two decisions affected media discussions, given that such discourse can strongly influence public perceptions and behaviors. We used a content analysis methodology to code 138 articles published in U.S. newspapers and magazines between 2012 and 2015. Focusing on a financial concern over the cost of SEF and the lack of insurance for SEF, we found that media portrayals of SEF pivot away from the ethical principle of nonmaleficence centered in the ASRM decision to discourage SEF. Instead, they highlight an issue of justice that can be remedied through the offer of SEF as a workplace benefit. Overall, media portrayals of SEF paint a simplistic and rosy picture that more options, especially more reproductive and economic options, automatically enhance women’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.</p>

<p>This article investigates the history of student “nature protection” organizations in the USSR and in contemporary Russia after 1991. Combining research in central and regional archives, interviews conducted during fieldwork, and published sources (including from <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online social network</span>s), this article reviews the institutional foundations and recruitment and working methods for this little-known form of environmental activism, which began in the Soviet period. Combining a high degree of social elitism with a vigilante approach and a corporatist desire for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, it contributed to the emergence of a dedicated green movement during the period of democratization in Russia (1987–93), before gradually fading away. It is now experiencing a certain revival under Vladimir Putin’s regime as a movement that represents both nostalgia for the late Soviet period and the renewal of expert-led protest in opposition to authoritarianism.</p>

<p>A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted of the techniques used to promote psychological need satisfaction and motivation within health interventions based on self-determination theory (SDT; Ryan &amp; Deci, 2017. Self-determination theory: Basic psychological needs in motivation, development, and wellness. New York, NY: Guilford Press). Eight databases were searched from 1970 to 2017. Studies including a control group and reporting pre- and post-intervention ratings of SDT-related psycho<span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>tors (namely perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support, need satisfaction and motivation) with children or adults were included. Risk of bias was assessed using items from the Cochrane risk of bias tool. 2496 articles were identified of which 74 met inclusion criteria; 80% were RCTs or cluster RCTs. Techniques to promote need supportive environments were coded according to two established taxonomies (BCTv1 and MIT), and 21 SDT-specific techniques, and grouped into 18 SDT based strategies. Weighted mean effect sizes were computed using a random effects model; perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support g = 0.84, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> g = 0.81, competence g = 0.63, relatedness g = 0.28, and motivation g = 0.41. One-to-one interventions resulted in greater competence satisfaction than group-based (g = 0.96 vs.&nbsp;0.28), and competence satisfaction was greater for adults (g = 0.95) than children (g = 0.11). Meta-regression analysis showed that individual strategies had limited independent impact on outcomes, endorsing the suggestion that a need supportive environment requires the combination of multiple co-acting techniques.</p>

<p>Project overview. The current study focuses on analyzing team flexibility by measuring entropy (where higher values correspond to system reorganization and lower values correspond to more stable system organization) across all-human teams and Human-<span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> Teams (HAT). We analyzed teams in the context of a fully-fledged synthetic agent that acts as a pilot for a three-agent Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) ground crew. The synthetic agent must be able to communicate and coordinate with human teammates in a constructive and timely manner to be effective. This study involved three heterogeneous team members who had to take photographs of target waypoints and communicate via a text-based communication system. The three team members’ roles were: 1) navigator provides information about flight plan with speed and altitude restrictions at each waypoint; 2) pilot adjusts altitude and airspeed to control the Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA), and negotiates with the photographer about the current altitude and airspeed to take good photos for the targets; and 3) photographer screens camera settings, and sends feedback to other team members regarding the target photograph status. The three conditions differed based on the manipulation of the pilot role: 1) Synthetic – the pilot was the synthetic agent, 2) Control – the pilot was a randomly assigned participant, and 3) Experimenter – the pilot was a well-trained experimenter who focused on sending and receiving information in a timely manner. The goal of this study is to examine how overall RPAS flexibility across HATs and all-human teams are associated with Team Situation Awareness (TSA). Method. There were 30 teams (10-teams per condition): control teams consisted of three participants randomly assigned to each role; synthetic and experimenter teams included two participants randomly assigned to the navigator and photographer roles. The experiment took place over five 40-minute missions, and the goal was to take as many “good” photos of ground targets as possible while avoiding alarms and rule violations. We obtained several measures, including mission and target level team performance scores, team process measures (situation awareness, process ratings, communication and coordination), and other measures (teamwork knowledge, workload, and demographics). We first estimated amount of system reorganization of the RPAS via an information entropy measure, i.e., the number of arrangements the system occupied over a given period of time (Shannon &amp; Weaver, 1975). Based on information entropy, we defined four layers to represent the RPAS (Gorman, Demir, Cooke, &amp; Grimm, In Review): 1) communications - the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>-based communication among team members; 2) vehicle - the RPA itself, e.g., speed, altitude; 3) control - interface between the RPA and the user; and system - the overall activity of the sub-layers. Then, we looked at the relationship between layers and TSA, which was based on successfully overcoming and completing ad hoc embedded target waypoints. Results and conclusion. Overall, the experimenter teams adapted to more roadblocks than the synthetic teams, who were equivalent to control teams (Demir, McNeese, &amp; Cooke, 2016). The findings indicate that: 1) synthetic teams demonstrated rigid systems level activity, which consisted of less reorganization of communication, control and vehicle layers as conditions changed, which also resulted in less adaptation to roadblocks; 2) control teams demonstrated less communication reorganization, but more control and vehicle reorganization, which also resulted in less adaptation to roadblocks; and 3) experimenter teams demonstrated more reorganization across communication, control and vehicle layers, which resulted in better adaptation to roadblocks. Thus, the ability of a system to reorganize across human and technical layers as situations change is needed to adapt to novel conditions of team performance in a dynamic task</p>

<p>Purpose of the study. The purpose of the study is the problem of forming a knowledge model of a specialist with higher education that is a part of an educational project. Its relevance is related to the need for an adequate response to strengthening the scientific and technological progress dynamics and the transition to the information interactions economy in the current conditions of the higher education system. Materials and methods. The information base of the research includes the laws on education of the Russian Federation, educational standards of higher professional education, scientists’ publications on the issues under investigation. The study used the following methods: system analysis, active systems theory, reflexive control theory, and modeling. Results. The research analyzes the consequences of Russia’s entry into the Bologna Convention on education. It shows that this event caused the problem of efficiency and quality of training specialists, as well as the problem of integrating higher education institutions into a new social and economic system related to their adaptation to market relations. According to the principle of institutional <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, solution of these problems is the responsibility of universities. The paper shows that the way to solve these problems is to transfer universities to a design and technological type of administration. The most promising form of education project management is the model of information interaction within the framework of active self-developing network expert environments. The elementary part of such an environment is an expert professional, who owns modern telecommunication technologies and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> means. Integration in the natural intelligence network structure forms a collective strategic subject, which is a tool of a knowledge and action synergy in the interaction process. The paper describes the developed structure of the active self-developing network expert environment and two principles of its functioning as an active multi-agent system when forming a specialist knowledge model. It is proposed to consider the construction of specialist’s knowledge model in the context of corporate knowledge management strategies in organizations to increase competitiveness, as the established support systems for organization knowledge lifecycle and specialist’s integral knowledge model are used to integrate strategic corporate tasks with strategic tasks of developing employees’ corporate knowledge. They consider a specialist as an element of a company production system. His purpose is to give a product specified quantitative and qualitative parameters that ensure its competitive advantages. To carry out production activities, a specialist uses a complex of abilities, knowledge and skills that should be considered as models of his production and technological activities. At each moment, this complex should be considered as a subjective model of its production and technological activity. This creates a basis for a university self-development process by involving advanced consumers using network technologies in the innovative process of improving educational services, receiving ideas or content by referring to their creative abilities in exchange for a reward that corresponds to a contribution. The paper proposes a system that provides a direction for finding solutions and ideas, as well as filtering, summarizing information, determining its value and prospects. It is shown that the method of improving the quality of solutions on an educational project is the synthesis of crowdsourcing technologies, network expertise and the methodology of the active systems theory. Conclusions. The proposed approach allows considering the process of extracting new ideas and knowledge when forming a specialist’s knowledge model as an active system with heterogeneous agents with a counter way of sharing information and active influence of the center in the form of queries to obtain reflexive estimates. It also allows ensuring the interaction of universities and an organization in managing their intellectual capital.</p>

<p>Transatlantic security cooperation entered a new era after the 9/11 attacks in America, the launch of EU crisis management/security assistance operations, and the release of the European Security Strategy (ESS) in 2003. Since then, years of practical experience have inspired the EU to enhance its ambitions in this realm by developing a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span>security Strategy, a Maritime Security Strategy, and most recently, the 2016 EU Global Strategy (EUGS). As these efforts respect NATO’s primary role in European defence, there is more scope for practical EU-US collaboration regarding crisis management and security assistance operations. However, although there have been some clear successes here, the EU is also increasingly willing to forge its own path in this realm and possibly diverge with US priorities. This article evaluates the recent record of, and prospects for, EU-US security collaboration regarding various problems mentioned as strategic priorities in the ESS, EUGS, and related documents</p>

<p>Abstract According to estimates by the World Health Organization, the average life expectancy will continue to rise. This indicator, being a measure of success in terms of healthcare, is not synonymous with quality of life and will increase healthcare costs. Associated with this problem are also the changes in terms of the organization of society, which has not been able to solve these constraints of functional limitations, dementia, social isolation, and loneliness. This paper presents the concept of adaptive surveillance based on mobile technology and artificial intelligence, presented in the context of a global physical activity monitoring program (MOVIDA), in his domus dimension designed to the elderly people with some functional limitation or dementia. The proposed solution for an adaptive surveillance is thus to conduct direct supervision programs, to enroll persons who live alone or in nursing homes who need supervision without limiting their individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The preliminary results show that it is possible to use the data obtained from a mobile <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> to identify routines and use this information to identify daily patterns. Changes to these routine patterns can be used to generate alarms for caregivers.</p>

<p>Purpose: Investigate the involvement of users with respect to the possession of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> and check whether it represents an extension of the self of its user. We also sought to identify the paradoxical perceptions regarding this mobile technology. Method: The research was based on a qualitative methodology, with the conducting in-depth interviews with 12 users, using the technique of content analysis. Results: It was verified that certain <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> users have strong emotional attachment to your device, considering it as an extension of your own identity. Were also highlighted four technological paradoxes in the behavior of use: Dependency x independence, Observed by discomfort in the absence of the appliance and at the same time the mobility that the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> delivers bringing greater independence; <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> x addiction; Satisfaction x Creation of needs; New x obsolete. Theoretical contributions: This research opens lines of research covering aspects linked to areas of consumer behavior and information systems regarding the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s. Originality / relevance: Due to the fact of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s being considered a recent technology, the relationship about self extended on the use of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> still was slightly raised, both in national and international literature. This research is based on an integrated vision of consumer behavior, psychology and information systems. The propositions of this study assume that the Blackberry <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> can be considered an extension of the identity of the user, due to the degree of involvement between both and, as a result of this involvement, can emerge paradoxes technology, i.e., the opposing perceptions about the use of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>.</p>

<p>Normative documents of the European Union in the field of education and science are analyzed, including the EU Framework Program for updated key competencies and establishment of&nbsp; European Qualifications Framework for lifelong education.&nbsp; The need to combine education within the lifelong learning process at all levels, the definition of processes, strategies and plans concerning youth, employment, social integration and research policies in this area is determined. The importance of ensuring the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of universities in the development of curricula and the choice of forms of education, promotion of the development of general competencies is stated. Basic requirements of the Strategy for a reasonable, sustainable and comprehensive growth of Europe 2020 are named, results of research on knowledge, skills and competences of future specialists demanded by Europe in 2030 and further are presented. The key trends of the EU policy in the field of education and culture, the EU “Erasmus +” program and Ukraine’s participation in the EU “Eastern Partnership” initiative, improvement of intercultural understanding, civic participation and ethical awareness, as well as ensuring equitable access to higher education in a united and inclusive society are determined. Worldwide, including the European Higher Education Area, experience of solving educational problems has confirmed the thesis about the importance of integrating competencies of all types, as each of them contributes to a successful life in a knowledge-based society. It is summed up that general knowledge of languages, education, ability to quantitative thinking and awareness in the field of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies is the necessary basis for learning, and education for the sake of knowledge includes the whole educational activity. &nbsp;Measures are identified and the goals for ensuring comprehensive and sustainable development, social cohesion and further enhancement of the democratic culture of the European Union countries are set out. In order to progressively develop the European Higher Education Area, it is necessary to intensify interdisciplinary and cross-border cooperation, as well as to develop inclusive and innovative approaches to learning and teaching</p>

<p>In recent years in Serbia - but also in recent decades in many other countries in the world - an intensive campaign of various social (most often <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>) groups against compulsory vaccination of children has taken place. Except for the pseudo-scientific study of Andrew Wakefield (1998), which has since been contested several times in serious scientific researches, as well as a few medical doctors in Serbia who referred to it, the whole of expert stakeholders, and epidemiologists in particular, has fiercely opposed the dangerous trend of parents renouncing compulsory vaccination of their children. This article aims to show that the consent to compulsory vaccination of children is not a matter of the right to <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the field of medicine - which implies the freedom of every human being to decide on one’s own life and body - but instead a matter of public health, which inevitably means of public interest as well, a matter which should be decided by competent professionals.</p>

<p>Feasible and effective interventions to promote physical activity among vocational school-aged adolescents are strongly needed. Text messaging and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> are feasible and acceptable delivery modes for PA interventions among youth. However, little is known about the opinion of vocational school-aged adolescents regarding behavioural change techniques that can be applied through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> or text messaging. Therefore, our aim was to gain insight into the opinions of vocational school-aged adolescents towards the use of different behaviour change techniques and towards <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>/text messaging as a delivery mode for PA interventions. Six focus groups were conducted with 41 adolescents from the first grade (12-14 years) of secondary vocational schools in Flanders (Belgium). In total 41 adolescents participated and completed a questionnaire about their text messaging and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> use prior to group discussions. Focus group discussions were audio-recorded and analysed using a thematic analysis method in Nvivo. Participants thought that different behaviour change techniques (e.g., providing feedback, goal setting, self-monitoring, social comparison) could be integrated in a PA intervention using text messaging and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> and were enthusiastic about participating in such an intervention. They indicated that text messages are an easy way to receive information about PA, and that a group page on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> is ideal to share information with others. Participants deemed it very important that the group page on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> would only include peers with whom they also share an offline connection. Furthermore, adolescents stressed the importance of having <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (e.g., to determine their personal activity goals, to self-monitor their behaviour) and of being active together with friends. This qualitative study revealed that the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> and text messaging is promising as a delivery method for PA interventions among vocational school-aged adolescents. The adolescents were keen to participate in an intervention that integrates behaviour change techniques using text messaging or <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>.</p>

<p>Swaths of personal and nonpersonal information collected online about <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> users are increasingly being used in sophisticated ways for online political manipulation. This represents a new trend in the exploitation of data, where instead of pursuing direct financial gain based on the face value of the data, actors engage in data analytics using advanced artificial intelligence technologies that allow them to more easily access individuals’ cognition and future behavior. Although in recent years the concept of online manipulation has received some academic and policy attention, the desirable relationship between <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security law and online manipulation is not yet fully explored. In other words, regulators and courts have yet to realize the importance of linking <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security law to individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, privacy, and democracy.</p>
<p>This Article provides an account of the desirable relationship between <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security law and other values, such as <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, privacy, and democracy, by looking at the phenomenon of online manipulation achieved through psychographic profiling. It argues that the volume, efficacy, and sophistication of present online manipulation techniques pose a considerable and immediate danger to <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, privacy, and democracy. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> actors, political entities, and foreign adversaries carefully study the personality traits and vulnerabilities of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> users and, increasingly, target each such user with an individually tailored stream of information or misinformation with the intent of exploiting the weaknesses of these individuals. This Article makes a broader argument about <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security law and its narrow focus on identity theft and financial fraud. Primarily, this Article looks at data-breach notification law, a subset of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security law, as reflective of that limited scope. It argues that data-breach notification law could provide a much-needed backdrop for the challenges presented by online manipulation, while alleviating the sense of lawlessness engulfing current misuses of personal and nonpersonal data. At the heart of this Article is an inquiry into the expansion of dated notions of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security law.</p>
<p>Presently, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security law’s narrow approach seeks to remedy materialized harms such as identity theft or fraud. This approach contravenes the purpose of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security law—to create legal norms protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer systems and networks. If <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security law seeks to protect individuals from the externalities of certain <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> risks, it needs to recognize emerging threats targeting computer systems and networks, and subsequently, individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, privacy, and democracy.</p>

<p>This article explores the challenges and opportunities of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> health activisms to shape public participation in the digital future of healthcare. As health becomes ever more entangled with digital technologies, a growing ecology of digital health services promise greater individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to learn about and managing medical conditions, as well as accessing health services and engaging in forms of self-care. Cautioning against optimist visions of digital health and their promise of empowerment and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, the article explores how health activisms on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> are reclaiming visions of healthcare that move beyond individual and depoliticised models of health technologies. The notion of cosmopolitics is employed to conceptualise relations between technology and health that implicate human and non-human interests in entanglements between health, morality and technology.</p>

<p>Drawing on identity theory and privacy research, this article argues that the need for self‐identity is a key factor affecting people’s privacy behavior in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s. I first unpack the mainstream, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>‐centric discourse of privacy, and then present a research model that illustrates a possible new theorization of the relationship between self‐identity and information privacy. An empirical study with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> users confirms the main hypotheses. In particular, the data show that the need for self‐identity is positively related to privacy management behaviors, which in turn result in increased self‐disclosure in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online social network</span>s. I subsequently argue that the so‐called “privacy paradox” is not a paradox per se in the context of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online social network</span>ing; rather, privacy concerns reflect the ideology of an autonomous self, whereas social construction of self‐identity explains voluntary self‐disclosure.</p>

<p>The need for a better understanding of the risk factors underpinning disordered gaming has been consistently emphasized. Although, gaming may offer a simple and straightforward means of alleviating distress, relying on gaming to address one’s unmet psychological needs could invite problematic usage. Self-determination theory highlights the significance of three universally inherent psychological needs for relatedness, competency, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. A motivation to engage in gaming may be to address unmet needs and may become problematic.This study aimed to assess whether experienced levels of loneliness, depression and self-esteem mediate the association between <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> Gaming Disorder (IGD) behaviours and Need-Fulfilment deficits.The participants comprised of 149 adults (83 males, 66 females), aged between 18 and 62 years. A series of self-reported questionaries assessing their levels of IGD behaviours, depression, loneliness, self-esteem and need-fulfilment were completed.Need-fulfilment deficits were linked to higher IGD behaviours. Interestingly, this association was mediated by the reported levels of self-esteem and depression and not loneliness.The findings lend further empirical support for the mediating role of psychological distress between need fulfilment deficits and IGD behaviours.</p>

<p>This article explores the dignity of consensual sex-workers through multiple prisms, namely: comparative law, philosophy, and Abrahamic religions. A deontological multidisciplinary approach becomes indispensable for discussing a multi-faceted phenomenon such as sex-work.</p>
<p>In discussing the legal aspect of the sex workers’ dignity, this article analyzes two notable Supreme Court decisions that focus on the human dignity issues associated with sex work: Bedford decision of the Canadian Supreme Court and Jordan decision of the Supreme Court of South Africa.</p>
<p>Further, this paper examines the sex workers’ case, philosophically, in light of Malby’s working model of human dignity. It adopts Malby’s model to assess the dignity of sex workers through examining sex-workers’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in their relationships with clients, pimps, brothels, and authorities.</p>
<p>This research also provides an overview of the human dignity of sex-workers in Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.</p>
<p>Finally, it compares sex work to same sex marriage and dwarf tossing as types of victimless crimes to emphasize the leading role of human dignity in carrying out ethical transformation.</p>
<p>This article is restricted to consensual sex work and it draws many information from interviews with sex workers available on YouTube and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social Media</span>. It aims at emphasizing the distinction between the dignity of the profession (sex work) and the dignity of the professionals (sex workers) throughout the multiple prisms. This distinction shows that consensual sex work does not necessarily deprive sex workers of their inherent human dignity and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and thus does not deprive them of their basic human rights.</p>

<p>This study focuses on choicework in situations of different subjective importance. Psychology students (N=74) and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> sample respondents (N=1,833) were asked to recollect several choice situations of varying importance from their experience and to name, describe, and evaluate them using a number of self-report measures. Combining qualitative and quantitative data analysis, we devised a series of qualitative indicators of choicework (context and content of choice, emotional attitude to the choice process, satisfaction with choice, mindfulness, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, difficulty, and significance) and compared the choice situations on these parameters. Significant and trivial choices differed on a number of variables (more significant situations were characterized by more complicated and conscious choicework). Choice situations with different thematic content also differed in their subjective importance and other parameters of choicework. The results imply the necessity to consider the scale of significance and the thematic content of situations used in choice studies.</p>

<p>The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things equips citizens with a phenomenal new means for online participation in sharing economies. When agents self-determine options from which they choose, for instance, their resource consumption and production, while these choices have a collective systemwide impact, optimal decision-making turns into a combinatorial optimization problem known as NP-hard. In such challenging computational problems, centrally managed (deep) learning systems often require personal data with implications on privacy and citizens’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. This article envisions an alternative unsupervised and decentralized collective learning approach that preserves privacy, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and participation of multi-agent systems self-organized into a hierarchical tree structure. Remote interactions orchestrate a highly efficient process for decentralized collective learning . This disruptive concept is realized by I-EPOS, the Iterative Economic Planning and Optimized Selections , accompanied by a paradigmatic software artifact. Strikingly, I-EPOS outperforms related algorithms that involve non-local brute-force operations or exchange full information. This article contributes new experimental findings about the influence of network topology and planning on learning efficiency as well as findings on techno-socio-economic tradeoffs and global optimality. Experimental evaluation with real-world data from energy and bike sharing pilots demonstrates the grand potential of collective learning to design ethically and socially responsible participatory sharing economies.</p>

<p>Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate how sustainability integrates the business strategy of Brazilian community supported agriculture (CSA) initiatives, and to understand the social, environmental and economic benefits to producers and consumers. Design/methodology/approach A case study was carried out through participant observation, using the techniques of ethnography, in addition to in-depth interviews and access to secondary data. Follow-up was carried out over two years and six months with two CSA initiatives. Findings The results indicated that the analyzed CSA activities address, in an integrated way, the social, environmental and economic dimensions of sustainability by promoting healthy diet, sustainable agriculture and social transformation to producers and consumers. Producers have their sales guaranteed due to previous consumers’ association; they also receive higher incomes, avoiding the rural exodus. In addition, their work conditions do not harm their health and the diversified production meets the consumption of their family group, increasing farmers’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Regarding consumers, there is a strong emphasis on education for sustainability. It occurs primarily through face-to-face contact among participants, at times of basket withdrawal, follow-up visits to production and interaction events at farmers’ place. Exchanges of information, recipes, cooking classes, newsletters and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> interactions are also important. As these outputs, verified in a real situation, integrate the mission and the business proposal of these CSAs initiatives, it is possible to conclude that, in these analyzed situations, sustainability is incorporated into a business strategy. Sustainability is a structural component of the strategy, with practices in different levels of the business activity. Research limitations/implications As an exploratory study, the findings cannot be extrapolated to broader populations. To improve generalization, it would be beneficial to broaden the sample and pursue comparative research between countries and regions. Also, studies should examine which incentive structures and programs would relate more to better outcomes in education for sustainability and behavior chances. Practical implications From a managerial point of view, this study contributes by presenting emerging businesses in Brazil, which incorporated sustainability in their strategy, contributing with the need pointed out by Robinson (2004) to provide innovative and creative solutions toward sustainability. It also presents some alternatives to achieve objectives of the 2030 Agenda, especially objective 2 (related to food security) and 12 (improve sustainable production and consumption systems). This study also contributes by elucidating alternatives to promote education for sustainable consumption, presenting cases where consumers reported a more sustainable behavior. Originality/value This study contributes to the literature by filling the gap pointed out by Arzu and Erkan (2010), Nakamba, Chan and Sharmina (2017), Rossi et al.&nbsp;(2017) and Searcy (2016) about addressing all three dimensions of sustainability in an integrated way, by analyzing CSA initiatives (a need indicated by Brown and Miller, 2008), especially evaluating empirical cases of sustainability insertion in the business strategy, as proposed by Claro, Claro and Amâncio (2008) and Franceschelli, Santoro and Candelo (2018). This study also responded to the need pointed out by Benites Lázaro and Gremaud (2016) to further understand the insertion of sustainability in the context of Latin America.</p>

<p>Autonomous and Adaptative <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span>-Physical Systems (ACPS) represent a new knowledge frontier of converging “nano-bio-info-cogno” technologies and applications. ACPS have the ability to integrate new `mutagenic’ technologies, i.e., technologies able to cause mutations in the society. Emerging approaches, such as artificial intelligence techniques and deep learning, enable exponential speedups for supporting increasingly higher levels of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and self-adaptation. In spite of this disruptive landscape, however, deployment and broader adoption of ACPS in safety-critical scenarios remains challenging. In this paper, we address some challenges that are stretching the limits of ACPS safety engineering, including tightly related aspects such as ethics and resilience. We argue that a paradigm change is needed that includes the entire socio-technical aspects, including trustworthiness, responsibility, liability, as well as the ACPS ability to learn from past events, anticipate long-term threads and recover from unexpected behaviors.</p>

<p>Abstract Although increasing numbers of employees working in public organizations are using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> for work purposes and numerous studies exist on how <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> affect organizational outcomes, we have very limited knowledge of how using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> for work purposes affects employees’ work motivation. This paper fills this important gap by using self-determination theory (SDT) to analyze how the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> for work purposes is associated with government employees’ need satisfaction and intrinsic work motivation. According to regression results, employees’ use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> is positively related to employees’ need satisfaction (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, relatedness, and competence) and, accordingly, intrinsic work motivation. However, further analysis shows that too much use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> has an averse effect. Theoretically, this study is one of the pioneer attempts to integrate e-governance with SDT. Practically, we encourage managers to use caution in promoting the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> for work purposes. Using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> two to three days a week may be the ideal range.</p>

<p>Literature points out the role of parenting on adolescent <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying involvement. However, it is necessary to clarify how gender affects this relationship. The aim of this study has been to examine the relation between the adolescents’ perception about parenting practices, and their involvement in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying, bearing in mind both girls’ and boys’ gender and progenitors’ gender. The sample comprised 2060 Spanish secondary school students (47.9% girls; Mage = 14.34). Two-way ANOVA and binary logistic regression analyses were carried out. An effect of the interaction between sex and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying roles in maternal affection and communication, inductive discipline, and psychological control, as well as paternal promotion of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and psychological control, was found. In general, it can be observed that the more negative results were found in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-aggressors, especially when this role is assumed by girls. The results of logistic regression analysis suggest that parenting practices explain better <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying involvement in girls compared to boys, finding some important differences between both sexes regarding protective and risk factors. These findings highlight the importance of parenting practices to explain <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying involvement, which supports the necessity of including family among the addresses of intervention programs.</p>

<p>The penetration of new media among the very young and in particular the use of tablets and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s, objects considered “natural” by children because they were already present at birth, made the analysis scenario very complex.&nbsp; As usual more or less consolidated in recent years, the phone arrives in the first year (eleven years) almost for all preadolescents. A conventional choice that comes from below, shared by the families of any social status, from the south or the north, young or less young and which we could define as ethical-pragmatic, answers two questions: the first, of a moral character, reflects the idea that children under the age of 11 have not yet acquired the cognitive tools to manage this new technological object and its consequences in “social” life; the second, more practical, believes that the phone can be useful for kids 11 years and older who will start going to school alone. But how will the life of the eleven years change with the arrival of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>? What will happen in their universe will be a small Copernican revolution, they will discover the possibility of always being connected, they will feel the need to be in a group, in a network, suffer exclusion or disinterest, they will be tempted to destroy the sense of boredom with any online game. Through a telephone, their first form of private property, will claim the right to privacy (block codes or even worse fingerprints), will experience the first forms of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. In short, they will experience adult life.</p>

<p>The article is devoted to the results of the academic stuff of Ukrainian universities employees regarding to the types and forms of their professional development. Professional development forms are ordered according to their reducing degree in meaning for respondents by a ranking method. It was determined that the first three ranked places among the named types and forms of university lecturers professional development took such activities as studying at trainings, courses, coaching sessions outside the native educational institution; using online forms and self-analysing of own professional experience accordingly. Nationwide advanced training courses and a system of professional development within native higher education institutions are highly demanded among lecturers, although are clearly underdeveloped forms.&nbsp; According to the results of the study, it is suggested to cultivate types of professional growth of the academic stuff of higher education institutions at the expense of accredited educational programs in educational or scientific institutions; expanding of educational online resources of a Ukrainian <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> segment, as well as involvement of European and worldwide relevant resources.

<p>Background: Self-determination theory, which deals with motivation and personality, comprises three factors of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence and relatedness that can be influenced by the features and potentials of social networks. Objectives We aimed to investigate the influence of social networks on the three main factors of the self-determination theory in learners. Methods: The present case-control study with a pretest-posttest design was conducted among 40 Iranian Ph.D.&nbsp;students who lived in Schengen area countries. Students were randomly divided into control (n = 20) and experimental (n = 20) groups. Before and after holding training sessions through a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> (<span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>) and face to face (FTF) education, Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and the intrinsic motivation inventory were used for data collection. The intrinsic motivation inventory is a valid instrument that evaluates the three factors of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence and relatedness. Results: the results indicated a significant difference between the two groups in terms of the three factors. The means of all the three variables improved significantly in the social network group as compared to the FTF group (P = 0.00). Although competence had improved in both groups, this improvement was greater in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> group relative to the FTF group (P = 0.00). Conclusions: Social networks provide better learning experiences. They improve learning outcomes as they boost learners’ relatedness, competence and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.</p>

<p>Exposure to ideal body types in the media has been consistently linked to reduced body satisfaction. Images posted on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s may also impact body satisfaction by portraying idealised standards of physical attractiveness promoted by peers. This study draws on self-determination theory to examine whether satisfaction of basic psychological needs (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness) protects against the negative effect of viewing <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> images depicting an ideal body type on body satisfaction. Female (n = 141) and male (n = 48) university students were randomly assigned to view either a body-ideal image or a travel image presented on a mock <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> profile. Viewing body-ideal imagery resulted in significantly lower body satisfaction compared to viewing travel imagery (d = -0.37). Satisfaction of the needs for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and competence predicted higher baseline body satisfaction; however, none of the psychological needs protected against the negative effect of viewing body-ideal imagery on body satisfaction. Limitations included brief exposure to a single <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> image and use of a convenience sample. Future research may benefit from measuring body image-specific rather than general psychological need satisfaction to predict state changes in body satisfaction.</p>

<p>This paper aims to explore the relationship between job characteristics (JC) and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) moderated by job satisfaction (JS) among educators in the higher education institutions in the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Oman, taking into consideration that most educators at the higher education institutions in this area are expatriates.,A sample of 157 faculty members and instructors was used. Five job characteristics (skill variety, task identity, task significance, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and feedback) and five OCB behaviors (altruism, civic virtue, courtesy, conscientiousness, and sportsmanship) were studied. The overall job satisfaction was measured with seven general items adopted from Al-Damour and Awamleh (2002). Data were collected voluntarily using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> network announcements and pencil and paper. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis was used in testing this moderation relationship.,Results showed that job satisfaction plays a significant moderating effect in enhancing the relationship between four out of the five job characteristics (feedback, skill variety, task identity and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>) and only two out of five OCB behaviors, namely, altruism and courtesy. Also, culture showed no significant impact on results.,Using a self-reporting tool, the respondents could give biased responses that might influence results. In addition, the use a complex relationship to establish a causality relationship among many variables measured with many items did make it difficult and sometimes errored out using SEM analysis.,This study delivers important suggestions to the management of these institutions as well as higher education administration about how to enhance their educators’ OCBs as a source of competitive advantage taking into consideration that expatriates work within certain legal and social contexts.,With very limited related research covering this region, this study provides an insight into how educators’ OCBs can be enhanced within unique employment structures and policies designed for expatriate educators in the GCC countries.</p>

<p>This research was conducted to examine Indonesian students’ experiences in using technology in learning English outside the classroom with regards to learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> as an important capacity for students learning success. The subjects of the study were students of a private Senior High School in South Tangerang. As for the methodology, this research applied quantitative and qualitative design. Quantitative elements include questionnaires as the data collecting method, while qualitative elements used semi structured interviews. In this interview, five students were chosen purposively based on students responses on the questionnaires. The findings of this study indicate that the use of technology to learn English outside the classroom has encouraged the development of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> which includes aspects of learning motivation, metacognitive awareness, self-confidence and social skills.

<p>Contemporary publics actively engage with diverse forms of media when seeking health-related information. The hugely popular digital media platform YouTube has become one means by which people share their experiences of healthcare. In this paper, we examine amateur YouTube videos featuring people receiving Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. DBS has become a widely implemented treatment, and it is surrounded by high expectations that can create difficulty for clinicians, patients and their families. We examine how DBS, Parkinson’s disease, and DBS recipients themselves, are delineated within these YouTube videos. The videos, we demonstrate, contain common compositional and stylistic elements that collectively represent DBS as a technological fix, and which accentuate the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the DBS recipient. The relational, interpersonal dimensions of chronic illness, and the complex impact of DBS on family dynamics, are elided. We therefore shed light on the means by which high expectations regarding DBS are sustained and circulated, and more generally, we illustrate how potentially powerful representations of medical technologies can emerge from the intersection of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms, afflicted bodies and patient narratives.</p>

<p>Through exploration and exploitation of new knowledge emergence, the collective intelligent decision-making (CID) level of Web-of-Cells (WoC) proposed by ELECTRA will be dramatically improved. For this purpose, we thoroughly investigate complex network theory and modeling methods for WoC with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>–physical–social systems (CPSS). WoC is a new intelligent dispatching framework characterized by weak centralization, self-organization coupling, high independence, efficient coordination, and autonomous learning. Based on these characteristics and actual engineering demands, in this paper, we adopt complex network theory, parallel machine learning, and multi-agent stochastic game theory to address three basic scientific issues in WoC dispatching and control: how to build a complex network model for WoC with CPSS to stimulate new knowledge emergence; how to analyze the evolution structure stability and operation stability during this knowledge emergence process; and how to use the emerged new knowledge to achieve cell <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and system-wide coordination based on independent and CID, respectively. Finally, we conduct some explorations and make a prospect for WoC. The biggest innovation of this paper lies in thoroughly investigating how to fully stimulate and utilize new knowledge emergence from WoC to greatly improve its CID level of dispatching and control. This will be of great significance to the development of new-generation power system smart dispatching in the future.</p>

<p>Author(s): Geisser, Lauren | Abstract: Some of the largest companies in the world—including <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> and Apple—began offering cryopreservation (aka, egg freezing) as a covered employee benefit as early as 2014. This Article discusses the ramifications of such coverage on other diversity policies and employee benefits, as well as with respect to class and racial inequality, and gender-normative societal roles.Egg freezing is an elective procedure to preserve a woman’s eggs by extracting, freezing and storing them until she is ready to get pregnant at a later point in time. Similar to how the Pill allowed women to defer pregnancy and invest in their careers in the 1970s, some see egg freezing as the ultimate breakthrough to level the playing field for women so that they can have both a career and motherhood. However, when an employer subsidizes that choice, and does so over other employee benefits such as paid parental leave, childcare or flexible work arrangements, the employer reinforces the dominant—yet as this Article shows, flawed—view that motherhood is incompatible with work.Indeed, our society was founded on notions of individual rights and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and egg freezing benefits claim to provide a woman with the choice to put her eggs on ice as she focuses on her career, financial stability, and finding a partner. This Article demonstrates that while potentially beneficial in the short term to recruit women and diversify the workplace, egg freezing coverage is more likely to aggravate class and racial inequality and disrupt the movements for supportive employee benefits and a restructuring of the societal norms of gender roles. With movements such as Time’s Up and #MeToo rallying women and men around the world, it is time to bring to light and question notions of traditional gender roles that companies may in effect be reinforcing.</p>

<p>Abstract The benefit of reviewing personal feedback to students’ learning of clinical communication skills is well researched. Less is known about the factors that related to students’ engagement in reviewing non-compulsory online feedback, and ways to motivate their behavioural engagement. In this paper, we reported two studies in which medical students completed assessed clinical video conferencing consultations with human simulated patients via an online training platform that also provided automated and human feedback for students. In Study 1, three days after the consultation, an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> with different instructional styles (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive, controlling or control) was sent to different groups reminding students to review their feedback. In Study 2, up to three repetitions of the same, either <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive or controlling, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s were sent to students. Results of Study 1 revealed that students who reviewed feedback before receiving <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s achieved higher assessment results and reported higher degree of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to participate in the training program than the remaining students. However, the different instructional styles of the single <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> in this study did not significantly influence the students’ engagement differently. Study 2 results revealed that students who received controlling <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s displayed higher engagement than students who received <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s. Findings suggested that multiple factors might influence students’ engagement in reviewing their online feedback, and this study provided evidences of the effects of using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s to motivate students to review the feedback.</p>
