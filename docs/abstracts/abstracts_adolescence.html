<p>In this article we present the case of the Evenki people, Siberian hunter-gatherers that share some traits of egalitarianism with other hunter-gathering people of the world. Using the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netic approach, proposed by Gregory Bateson in social anthropology, we describe the circular logic of interaction between genders and study the strategies that Evenki use to solve contradictions between personal <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> ( manakan ) and dependencies associated with inter-gender relationships. The scope of our interest covers such situations as flirting, conjugal unit establishment, promotion of business contacts with strangers ( andaki relationships), everyday violence and aggression, as well as ecstatic states. The presented analysis of the episodes of interaction in everyday life shows that Evenki social organization is based on a situational approach to the distinction of genders. The research is based on several fieldworks conducted in the Baikal region (Russia), but the core materials relate to a two-month stay with one Evenki community in spring 2006.</p>

<p>The monitoring of children in time and space, from a distance via the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s, is a phenomenon never experienced in previous generations. Indeed, as frequently recited, the increased protection of children by monitoring them is a central characteristic of modern childhood (Rasmussen, 2003; Qvortrup, 1993) and the effects of this are not yet know. Equally our understanding of how children in middle childhood (8 – 12 years) negotiate and or resist this monitoring is unclear. This paper seeks to add to the emerging body of knowledge on the strategies employed by children in middle childhood to negotiate and resist the monitoring and surveillance of their physical selves in time and space using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s. I suggest that the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> can be transformed by children into a highly efficient device to enable them to both negotiate and resist surveillance thus increasing their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and independent mobility. Children are not passive recipients of parental surveillance and power, rather they are increasingly playing an active role in negotiation with parents and actively resist monitoring of their everyday lives to both make meaning anew and produce culture.</p>

<p>US is unique amongst developed states in preferring private adoption, a position that Katz associates with the American bias towards market mechanisms and preference for individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> over state regulation. Adoption involves the legal, permanent transfer of a child from the birth parent or parents to new caregivers. In intercountry adoption, this transfer occurs across an international border. The child usually moves to a new country, to parents of different race, culture and language from the birth family, and acquires a new nationality. The child’s new identity replaces his or her original one. Adoption, therefore, it is appropriate to say involves losses as well as gains. This paper examines the use of intercountry adoption to provide for children in the most disadvantaged conditions. It discusses whether and how international legal instruments and domestic measures can combine to ensure proper standards are applied to such adoptions. (1) In doing so it accepts that intercountry adoption can and should be regulated, rejecting both the alternatives of a free market and a complete ban on adoption. The paper argues that regulatory standards, particularly the control of private adoptions, are required to ensure that abuses such as abduction and trafficking of children are eliminated. Also, as a child welfare measure that has the potential to compromise the human rights of both birth parents and children, adoption should only be used where it is appropriate to the child’s situation. Adoption is known to make psychological demands on the parties beyond those of natural parenthood. For this reason, the paper proposes that research knowledge and experience should be applied so that the arrangements made provide the best chance for stable, long-term relationships for children who have been adopted. (2) ORIGINS OF INTERCOUNTRY ADOPTION Intercountry adoption came about largely as an altruistic response to the plight of war orphans and the abandoned children of servicemen in World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. It now involves the transfer of more than 30,000 children each year from over 50 countries. (3) With few exceptions, children move from poor countries to wealthy ones. (4) In the main receiving countries–the United States, Canada and most countries of Western Europe–the number of such adoptions has doubled over the last decade. Many factors have contributed to this increase. In receiving countries, the decline in fertility associated with postponing marriage, the limited success and high cost of infertility treatment and a lack of domestic adoption opportunities have made intercountry adoption an alternative to childlessness. Intercountry adoption has also become easier as information about how it can be achieved has become more readily available, most recently via the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. In states of origin (sending countries), extreme poverty, lack of contraception and attitudes to birth outside of marriage are three major factors leading to the abandonment of children to institutions. (5) In Eastern Europe, social and economic collapse following the end of communist regimes left orphanages close to destitution. Those responsible for these institutions, the welfare organizations that support them and would-be parents in other countries, have all seen intercountry adoption as a solution. In China, the one-child policy and the cultural preference for boys have led to the abandonment of large numbers of girls to under-funded and inadequate institutions. In response to these phenomena, organizations have sprung up to facilitate intercountry adoption. For many of these agencies, acting as an intermediary has become a business. Because of the increase in international adoptions, a new legal regime has been developed. In 1993, the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption was signed to create an international framework for arranging and formalizing these adoptions and to prevent abuses. …</p>

<p>Background: This study aimed to explore the associations between personality factors, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, religion and risk behaviours (RBs) among students. Methods: Six separate binary logistic regression models were built to explore associations of problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> use (PIU), binge drinking and smoking for boys and girls (807 students, 75% females, 19.6 mean age) with personality variables (Plasticity, Stability), <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (awareness of self), religion (importance &amp; attendance). Findings: The individual models revealed that PIU was associated with Plasticity and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for both genders and with Stability for boys. Binge drinking was associated with Plasticity for both genders, with importance of religion for boys and attendance for girls. Smoking was associated with Plasticity for both genders, with <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for boys and Stability and religious attendance for girls. Discussion: A higher level of Plasticity seems to be generally associated with RBs while Stability, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and religion, although differently for each gender, is protective. This distinction may be an important aspect of prevention programs.</p>

<p>The world of women and work is aptly included in the social science literature but is the world of women and work, and sex? When women work in the sex industry as strippers, prostitutes or in online <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> rooms, is that employment which is subject to labor law protection and provisions of occupational safety and health? Should it be? For the sex worker, according to this book, much depends on the possibility for authentic sexual feeling to be temporarily removed from the workplace of the sex worker, just as a manger might remove the desire for strict ethical adherence from work in a corporate bureaucracy. If the heart and soul of the sex worker is removed from the workplace, in that case, the sex worker is thought to be employed just like the rest of us. Presently, legal protection for sex workers is not quite socially or politically accepted, but neither has been much of any work by women which comes with complete <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, freedom, and financial benefit. Wherever sex work may be along the continuum of employment-related credibility, it is made more credible in the book On the Game: Women and Sex Work, a researchbased journey into the public and private worlds of female sex workers. On the Game takes a bold position that few other social scientists are willing to take: that sex work is metaphorically no different from any other wage-earning work. The author states, “I introduce views of prostitution as work, comparable to any other…” (p.&nbsp;34). Twice in the book, the author provides a famous quote by Marx: ‘Prostitution is only a particular expression of the universal prostitution of the worker…’ (p.&nbsp;41, p.&nbsp;125; Marx 1975). On the Game attempts to deconstruct accumulated negative stereotypes of sex workers. It is a book not necessarily unwilling to view prostitution through a cultural lens. Rather, it is willing to do anything, so long as it views prostitution as “simply work”, much the same as work done by non-prostitutes.</p>

<p>In this paper, which is part of a twelve-month ethnography on the&nbsp;sociocultural practices and meanings ascribed to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s in a low-income neighbourhood in Southern Brazil, I examine various forms of appropriation of this gadget in their intersections with gender relations . Following a literature discussion about gender relations in low-income groups, as well as the role of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s in love/sexual relationships, I argue that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s are appropriated to strengthen love ties, but also cause tension and conflict to arise as they become tools of surveillance. In this sense, I discuss the ways in which <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s engender what Foucault called the micropolitics of daily life, in which men and women interact in sociocultural dynamics that may reproduce gender hierarchies, but also hold the potential to subvert them. As such, the analysis also pays attention to the vitality and humour present in women’s narratives, in order to argue that these seem to be connected to a certain <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the female persona. The discussion engages with the work of various other researchers internationally and in Brazil and reflects on the cross-cultural implications of these practices in relation to similar studies in Africa.</p>

<p>Ecological view of human development calls for an investigation of multiple contexts surrounding children. In South Korea, traditional Confucianism and recent technological advancements serve as influential social and cultural contexts that affect parent–child relations and child development. High levels of parental control and strong emphasis on academic achievement have long been distinctive features of Korean parenting practices, which are attributable to Confucian values. Additionally, Korean children’s <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> dependency (MPD) has become a growing concern, as South Korea developed as an IT powerhouse. Combined, these contexts resulted in high parental control of children’s <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> use, so that such electronic devices would not hinder learning and achievement. Effects of high parental control on children’s MPD and their school life, however, have yet to be discovered. We hypothesized, that, unlike parents’ intentions, psychological control is more likely to increase MPD and disrupt school life. To examine this research model, we made use of the first and third wave data from Korea Children and Youth Panel Survey. Participants were 2378 children (52.2&nbsp;% boys) of the same age of 10 in the first wave. After multiple imputation for missing values, hierarchical logistic regression followed to examine the mediational model. The results verified the hypothesized model, showing significant adverse influence of psychological control on MPD, self-regulated learning and school adjustment. MPD fully mediated the effect of psychological control on self-regulations, while partially mediating the effects on school adjustment. Implications for Korean parents with regard to supporting children’s psychological <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> was discussed.</p>

<p>AbstractThe transition to adulthood, often accompanied by an emptying of the family nest, has implications for family relationships, identities and consumption practices. Despite this, the voices and experiences of emerging adults are largely missing from literature on family consumption. Emerging adult families typically combine digital natives and digital immigrants, but little is known about how their interactions around digital communications technology relate to emerging adult preoccupations with affiliation and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. This interpretive study explores how emerging adults’ <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s are bound up with a complex network of family communication and consumption practices, often across household, geographic and generational boundaries. Affiliation and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> emerged as intertwined rather than competing dimensions of participants’ <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use, contributing to the distribution and development of family as the nest empties.</p>

<p>Abstract In this paper we explore <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s as a form of fashion accessory for young women in contemporary culture and the possible value of such fashionable items as a source of identity and self‐worth. Despite reliance on the usual stultifying stereotypes produced by marketeers to promote <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s, we explore the possibility that increased access to public space generates for adolescent girls alternative choices of leisure experiences and possibilities of multiple enriching identities. The findings suggest that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> use can impart a sense of self‐confidence, sexuality and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> which defies the male gaze in public spaces and may allow adolescent women to reject traditional images of femininity at a formative stage in the life course and take steps to a further array of leisure choices. It may only be a temporary image that assists a sense of self at a vulnerable time in life, or it may infiltrate other aspects of subjectivity and assist an ongoing sense of self‐confidence.

<p>This paper uses data from twenty-one online and in-person qualitative interviews to examine the meaning and use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> rooms located on men for men (M4M) websites from the perspectives of men seeking men on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. This research is inspired by recent public health and social sciences literature on gay websites and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> rooms. The data indicate that these online sites help expedite learning about sex and sexuality and, for men who are shy or geographically isolated, to interact with metropolitan gay communities. There is, however, a measure of stigma associated with use of these <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> rooms, particularly by men who are older or in coupled relationships. Using these data, the paper argues that M4M <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> rooms play a vital role in fostering the sexual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of many men who frequent these venues and that sociologists should devote more study to the complexity of online social interaction.</p>

<p>Drawing upon semi-structured interviews and open-ended surveys with adolescents who have moved to the USA in the past twelve years, this article explores the nuanced ways in which expectations of authority and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> structure <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> use in migrant and refugee families. It finds that contrary to reports of US parents who fear that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> rules and restrictions undermine intimacy, refugee families may view restriction as an expression of intimacy because it is related to cultural expectations. Moreover, the article points out that whereas mobile communication almost always provides access to <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> among white middle class families, these media only sometimes provide access to <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> among refugee families.</p>

<p>Abstract: Leisure activities are defined individually and influenced by the culture and social issues. They are also directed for satisfying personal needs and the attainment of pleasure. Describing leisure activities can help constructing and planning professional interventions that focus on healthy leisure activities and also help planning public policies. Data collection was conducted through the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>, with 273 students, who lived at many different Brazilian states. The concept of leisure is linked to the time free of obligations and the choice for leisure activities is related with variables such as gender, working status, if have children and socio-economic self-perception. The information is discussed considering how people interpret the leisure, their motivations and satisfaction with these choices.

<p>ASHAMED AS I AM TO SAY IT, the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> is at the hub of my life. My two daughters were breast-fed with one hand while I typed away on the other. My family is scattered across Europe, Australia, and the United States and communicates daily through the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. My most heated marital arguments are often solved on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. My colleague and I, sitting in a room barely able to contain our two desks and mountains of books and papers, exchange <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s rather than turn our heads to interrupt the other’s flow of thought. Professionally, my editing, writing, networking, sharing of information and ideas is now almost completely based on e-mail exchanges with women and men around the world. For someone who professes very little technical skills and relies heavily on the young men around her to assist when the inevitable crashes occur, this transformation of my life by the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> is somewhat curious. It appears to have stretched my mode of personal, professional, and social communication and wrapped itself around my psyche as I devote much emotional and creative energy to e-mail conversations. From my own experience and those of my network, I see the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> as providing a new medium for women to work across communities, link up to diasporas and to women from other cultures that share the same concerns about women’s struggle for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and self determination. It is unique medium in that it seems to give expression both to the personal and to the political. All of the women who participated in the survey are friends and allies, largely because we can stay in touch across the miles through the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. We shared important life events—babies born, family deaths, achievements of our campaigns, our thoughts in progress—almost in real time. The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> has certainly strengthened our work and as created another facet of our lives. It has, oddly enough, also pushed for many more face-toface meetings, invitations, and political opportunities as people meet in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>space and then seek to put a face to a personality only understood from the screen. We are yet to understand fully its impact politically and personally, but for me it has enriched and extended my life and given me the opportunity to learn and work closely with women whom I see as part of both my local and global political and personal space or “glocality” where women can truly shape their lives.</p>

<p>In two studies, we demonstrate that attitudes toward traditional sexual roles are linked with increased sexual passivity for women but decreased passivity for men. For both genders, sexual passivity predicts poor sexual functioning and satisfaction. Study 1 showed that endorsement of traditional sexual roles of male dominance and female passivity relates to greater sexual passivity among college-aged heterosexual women but less passivity for college-aged heterosexual men. For both young men and women, greater sexual passivity predicts less overall sexual satisfaction. The findings for Study 2 replicate Study 1 among sexually experienced adults recruited over the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> mediated these relationships, which persisted when controlling for multiple potential confounds.</p>

<p>Drawing on qualitative interview data, this article observes the current structure of the Melbourne-based male sex industry, taking into account the unpopularity of traditional sex work ‘venues’ such as the street, print advertising, brothels and agencies. In recent years, the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> has arisen as a viable alternative to these sites. Motivations for the pursuit of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>-based work are numerous and include perceptions of greater ease, convenience and accessibility; anonymity, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and safety, but, above all, the potential for more lucrative returns. The article also highlights the seemingly large numbers of men using dating websites who are casually propositioned online and may consent to such proposals, suggesting further research is required to ascertain the characteristics and experiences of those involved in informal sex work activity.</p>

The child was asked to touch a picture on the screen with a coordinated hand movement to obtain the appearance of a new picture. The training was organized into four levels of increasing difficulty, which were progressively administered in different sessions. Response times and number of errors were collected at each session. The child improved in performing computerized training, becoming faster and more accurate. Unlike control participants, she also improved in performing untrained tasks, which implied similar skills.

<p>Aims and objectives. The aim of the current study was to explore and describe the strategies young women with Type 1 diabetes used to manage transitions in their lives. This paper will describe one aspect of the findings of how women with Type 1 diabetes used the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> to interact with other people with diabetes and create stability in their lives. Background. Individuals living with diabetes develop a range of different strategies to create stability in their lives and enhance their well-being. Changing social and emotional conditions during life transitions have a major impact on diabetes management. Although the literature indicates that strategies enabling the individuals to cope with transitions are important, they remain under-researched. Design. Using grounded theory, interviews were conducted with 20 women with Type 1 diabetes. Constant comparative data analysis was used to analyse the data and develop an understanding of how young women with Type 1 diabetes used the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> to create stability in their lives. Findings. The findings revealed that the women valued their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and being in control of when and to whom they reveal their diabetic status, especially during life transitions and at times of uncertainty. However, during these times they also required health and social information and interacting with other people. One of the women’s main strategies in managing transitions was to use <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> lines as a way of obtaining information and communicating with others. This strategy gave women a sense of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, enabled them to maintain their anonymity and interact with other people on their own terms. Conclusions. Having meaningful personal interactions, social support and being able to connect with others were fundamental to the women’s well being. Most importantly, preserving <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and anonymity during such interactions were integral to the way the women with Type 1 diabetes managed life transitions. Relevance to clinical practice. Health professionals need to explore and incorporate <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> communication process or anonymous help lines into their practice as a way to assist people manage their diabetes.</p>

<p>The rapid expansion of computer use and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> connection has the potential to change patterns of family interaction, with conflicts arising over adolescents’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, parental authority and control of the computer. This study applied a conceptual framework derived from family development and human ecology theory to investigate family characteristics related to the likelihood of such conflicts.

<p>Over the past couple of decades, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s have penetrated Sri Lanka at an unprecedented rate. The rate of adoption of cell phones in the country has been remarkably fast, and not gradual as in other nations. Yet, examination of the developmental impact of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s has drawn surprisingly little attention in Sri Lanka. Therefore, this article attempts to investigate the empowering effect of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s on dependent housewives in poor households of the country by using a mixed research method. Our research found that access to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s was certainly empowering for these women: <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s unequivocally strengthened and expanded their social circle and support networks; they led them to domesticate technology, thus challenging negative societal attitudes toward women as technologically incompetent and timid; they reduced women’s information poverty; and opened them up to a newer, non-traditional fun space, which was a clear manifestation of choice and power. However, the women’s use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s was largely controlled within the household, mainly because they did not have their own income to maintain the phones, thus underlining the need for their financial <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Those women who owned their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s had more control over them than those who lacked legal ownership. To conclude, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s can play a significant role in empowering poor women in Sri Lanka, and can be considered as a tool in the policy agenda for women’s empowerment by the government.

<p>This study reports the modeling of three categories of ineffective vegetable parenting practices (IVPP) separately (responsive, structure, and control vegetable parenting practices). An <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> survey was employed for a cross sectional assessment of parenting practices and cognitive-emotional variables. Parents (n=307) of preschool children (3-5 years old) were recruited through announcements and postings. Models were analyzed with block regression and backward deletion procedures using a composite IVPP scale as the dependent variable. The independent variables included validated scales from a Model of Goal Directed Vegetable Parenting Practices (MGDVPP), including: intention, habit, perceived barriers, desire, competence, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, relatedness, attitudes, norms, perceived behavioral control, and anticipated emotions. The available scales accounted for 26.5%, 16.7% and 44.6% of the variance in the IVPP responsive, structure and control subscales, respectively. Different sets of diverse variables predicted the three IVPP constructs. Intentions, Habits and Perceived Behavioral Control were strong predictors for each of the IVPP constructs, but the subscales were specific to each IVPP construct. Parent emotional responses, an infrequently investigated variable, was an important predictor of ineffective responsive vegetable parenting practices and ineffective structure vegetable parenting practices, but not ineffective control vegetable parenting practices. An Attitude subscale and a Norms subscale predicted ineffective responsive vegetable parenting practices alone. This was the first report of psychometrically tested scales to predict use of IVPP subscales. Further research is needed to verify these findings in larger longitudinal cohorts. Interventions to increase child vegetable intake may have to reduce IVPP.</p>

<p>As part of a Nordic multi-centre study investigating the life and care situation of community samples of schizophrenic patients the aim of the present part of the study was to examine the relationship between global subjective quality of life and objective life conditions, clinical characteristics including psychopathology and number of needs for care, subjective factors such as satisfaction with different life domains, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social network, and self-esteem. A sample of 418 persons with schizophrenia from 10 site</span>s was used. The results of a final multiple regression analysis, explaining 52.3% of the variance, showed that five subjective factors were significantly associated with global subjective quality of life, together with one objective indicator, to have a close friend. No clinical characteristics were associated with global subjective quality of life. The largest part of the variance was explained by satisfaction with health, 36.3% of the variance, and self-esteem, 7.3% of the variance. It is concluded that the actual relationship between objective life conditions and subjectively experienced quality of life still remains unclear. Furthermore, it seems obvious that personality related factors such as self-esteem, mastery and sense of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> also play a role in the appraisal of subjective quality of life, which implies that factors like these are important to consider in clinical and social interventions for patients with schizophrenia in order to improve quality of life for these persons.</p>

<p>The current study examined 1316 South Asian youth socialized in progressively Westernized contexts: “traditional” Indian homeland single-sex schools, “transitional” Indian homeland co-educational schools, and the immigrant “diaspora” in Canadian schools. Results showed youth in the three contexts were similar on romantic desire. Yet those in increasingly Westernized contexts reported more romantic activities and greater perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> from parents in partner choice. They were also more likely to consume Western and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, and possess friends fostering permissive expectations, greater cross-sex network composition, and intimate communication. Involvement with the global media and friends explained the link between the cultural spectrum and romantic experiences. Implications of global restructuring on romantic experiences, media usage, and friendships are discussed, in consideration of gender.</p>

<p>While ICTs are being used to support development women do not profit from them as much as men do. Therefore we need to look into how <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> technology can be designed and applied to improve womens lives and womens access to information education and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. This article suggests an avenue to empower women in the North and South (who already have <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> access) by building virtual international communities as one of the tools for women to participate in and benefit from international exchange. It describes the social and technical aspects of building an enabling environment for women called the Virtual International Womens University (vifu). A development procedure characterized by inclusion participation user-developer-interaction and transparency with the aim of enabling sociability and the transfer of technological know-how is discussed. The article will argue that when ICTs are going to be promoted and used also for developmental issues their specific technical and social design will play an important role for the success or failure of a certain initiative.

<p>It has been recommended that parents should monitor their children’s <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use, including what sites their children visit, what messages they receive, and what they post. In this paper, I claim that parents ought not to follow this advice, because to do so would violate children’s right to privacy over their on-line information exchanges. In defense of this claim, I argue that children have a right to privacy from their parents, because such a right respects their current capacities and fosters their future capacities for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and relationships.</p>

<p>A conversational method is necessary for experimenter and subject to collaborate in the exploration of the world of human beings. Individuals cannot be treated as objects, or be instructed how to take part in an experiment, without the recognition of the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of each person and the invitation to participate jointly in co-operative exploration of the nature of man. An individual can be seen as a personal scientist who forms theories about the world and tests these theories against his personal experience of reality, adapting his theories for a more effective anticipation of events and hence a more competent interaction with his environment. A suite of computer programs (PEGASUS, FOCUS, MINUS, CORE, ARGUS and SOCIOGRIDS) has been developed, each one acting as a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netic tool to enhance man’s capabilities to understand both himself and his relationships with other perspectives of the world. PEGASUS is described, including PEGASUS-BANK which can be used to explore the relationship of an individual with another individual (or group). The CORE program can be used to chart change in a person over time, and to find the level of understanding and agreement between two people. Shared understanding within small groups can be investigated using the SOCIOGRIDS program which produces a mapping of the intra-group relationships, and the subject content which shows the extent of agreement in the group. A study involving the exchange of subjective standards in human judgement is briefly described, and an analogy drawn to the understanding of different perspectives in the treatment of a medical or clinical patient.</p>

<p>Mobile communication emerged as a dominant channel for networked teenagers. While some theorists celebrate possibilities for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, others are concerned that the increased reliance on mobile-based communication leads to disparities in digital skill and status replication. We examined how mobile-mediated behavior among teens interacted with the characteristics of socio-demographics and mobile access to predict (1) levels of diverse use and skill and (2) consequences of skill/use differences ( n = 552). Findings revealed that skill/use disparities were manifested based on race, and such variations were associated with status of parents in interaction with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> ownership. Instrumental use and content/creation-based skill had significant impacts on public involvement among teens. Our data have implications for understanding how social backgrounds incubate mobile-based disparities in light of enabling teens’ life chances.</p>

<p>This paper reports some of the findings from a study that aimed to analyse the motives for using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s and to establish profiles from their responses. To do this, we carried out a survey study based on a purposely designed questionnaire answered by 478 women from rural areas of Andalusia aged 18 to 65. From an analysis of the responses, we identified two profiles based on the use motives of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s. The results indicate that women, who use social networks with a higher diversity of uses, also express higher level of intensity, ability and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of use. In contrast, women who use only social networks with a relational purpose, also express lower level of intensity, ability and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the use of social networks. These findings suggest that use motives is a predictor variable of rural women’s digital inclusion in the social networks. The findings allow us to rethink the educational proposals of digital literacy.</p>

<p>Indian mega-cities have been undergoing remarkable socio-cultural transformations alongside major economic shifts driven by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies. The newly emerging economic spaces are characterized by numerous complex home–workplace links, speeding up of information and communication flows; time–space compression; and increased individualism (Cresswell, 2009). These have juxtaposed different spatial and temporal domains in close proximity to each other. In this context, the location of female subjectivity posits an interesting field of enquiry, primarily because women have often been projected as epitomizing these new economic spaces in the visual images and corporate billboards that dot the urban cityscape. These new “iconic” women are perceived to have access to technical and higher education, corporate jobs, and greater <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>—in short, they are portrayed as the privileged signifiers and transmitters of new India (Radhakrishnan, 2009). And the new economic spaces have been cons…</p>

<p>In Iran, where males and females are kept separated in different spheres, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> may be used as an opportunity to bridge this gap between the genders. However, this study showed that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>, as a nonymous platform in which people are in contact with their already-made social ties, didn’t seem to be liberating from the existing norms and rules within society. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> was a stage that became restricted with the involvement of social ties. The study’s analysis of interviews with six young Iranians showed that social meanings and norms of self-presentation on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> are defined to a large degree in terms of gender.

<p>This ethnographic study conducted among young women aged 18-21 years in Chiang Mai, northern Thailand, explored the parental control mechanisms imposed by Thai middle-class families on the sexuality of their daughters. It addressed the ways in which young women tactically use the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> in order to negotiate the sexual controls they encountered in everyday life. Taking the teenage girls’ point of view, this paper argues that, as active agents, young women achieve a certain level of sexual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and construct their own sexual selves in modern northern Thai society, despite their parents’ attempts to prevent this. The paper highlights the ways in which <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> are used by Thai girls in order to achieve such a goal. Research findings should inform the development of future programmes on sexual health promotion, parental skills and sexual communication between Thai parents and their children.</p>

<p>IntroductionAdolescence is a developmental stage in life that is associated with major cognitive, emotional, physiological and social change. Adolescence coincides with the onset of puberty and is typically described by parents as a period in which they attune to their child’s growing need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and greater desire to source social support from same aged peers. Many adolescents look forward to the transition to secondary school as it represents a period of possibilities; a time to master new academic, social, emotional and extracurricular activities (1). However, adapting to multiple formal and informal organizational and social relational structures that are inextricably linked with the high school environment can prove particularly daunting to transitioning students (2).Transitioning from primary school to a secondary boarding school adds another layer of complexity to secondary school life, as students have to simultaneously adjust from a situation where home and school are separate, into a setting where a temporary new home and schooling are merged together. Although some boarding students have reported the transition to boarding school has given them a greater appreciation for family and home, other students have equally reported that the process of adapting to new boarding school duty of care rules and regulations can be difficult as they tend to reduce privacy and personal freedom. Moreover, it commands boarding students to almost instantly display high levels of self-reliance, life skills and independence Similarly, boarding school requires adjusting from a situation where contact with family members occurs on a daily face-to-face basis to a situation where for extended periods of time contact is limited to contact via telephone, Skype and other means of communication such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> and text messages. Others have also described this change as shifting from vertical relationships with parents to horizontal relationships with peers at school and within the boarding house (3).Friendship and peer support are needed for the development of social, emotional and mental health and have been identified as important contributors to a successful school transition (4). Peers not only provide support, but information and guidance (5). However, a peak in bullying victimization occurs following the transition to secondary school (6) largely resulting from the pressure to attain high social status and the formalization of relationships and social roles in new social groups (7). The seriousness and negative impact of school bullying is well known contributing to significant physical, psychological and social wellbeing problems (8) which in turn effects academic performance (9).In boarding schools, a significantly larger amount of time is spent with peers (24 hours a day, 7 days a week) compared to day students (6 hours a day, 5 days a week). Arguably, the residential boarding context provides greater opportunity for bullying to occur (10, 11).Some have described bullying at boarding school as ‘relentless’ given that targets have fewer choices to minimize their exposure to bullying, with bullying often following the target from the day school setting into the residential setting (3). Evidence suggests bullying can become institutionalized into the culture of boarding schools that are not vigilant to its presence (11). Poynting and Donaldson (10) described peer-to-peer bullying in one Australian elite boys’ only boarding school as endemic and entrenched, taking the form of ridicule and racial slurs, physical and sexualized assault, all contained within a culture of intimidation and non-disclosure. In these instances bullying has been justified through language that constructs it as a ‘tradition’ or ‘initiation’ and analogous with a normal a rite of passage (12).The long term negative mental health and life trajectory implications for individuals that experience bullying and also perpetrate bullying while at school are increasing being acknowledged (13). …</p>

<p>Although everyday life is often demanding, it remains unclear how demanding conditions impact self-regulation. Some theories suggest that demanding conditions impair self-regulation, by undermining <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, interfering with skilled performance and working memory, and depleting energy resources. Other theories, however, suggest that demanding conditions improve self-regulation by mobilizing super-ordinate control processes. The present article integrates both kinds of theories by proposing that the self-regulatory impact of demanding conditions depends on how people adapt to such conditions. When people are action-oriented, demanding conditions may lead to improved self-regulation. When people are state-oriented, demanding conditions may lead to impaired self-regulation. Consistent with this idea, action versus state orientation strongly moderates the influence of demands on self-regulatory performance. The impact of demanding conditions on self-regulation is thus not fixed, but modifiable by psychological processes. Demanding conditions are pervasive in everyday life. At the workplace, employees need to stay abreast of rapid technological innovations and deal with constant pressures towards increased efficiency and productivity. In educational settings, students must meet high standards of academic excellence, often while performing low-paying jobs to cover high tuitions and while taking care of their family members. Even among friends, there are always <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s to be responded to, birthdays to be remembered, meetings to be arranged, favors to be returned, along with countless other duties and obligations. Given that demanding conditions are exceedingly common, it is important to understand how people can most effectively deal with such conditions. Unfortunately, psychological theories offer seemingly contradictory insights into this matter. Some influential theories propose that demanding conditions are likely to undermine self-regulation (Baumeister &amp; Showers, 1986; Beilock, Kulp, Holt, &amp; Carr, 2004; Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000; Muraven &amp; Baumeister, 2000). However, other theories suggest that demanding conditions lead people to marshal their self-regulatory resources, resulting in enhanced motivation and self-regulation (e.g., Botvinick, Braver, Barch, Carter, &amp; Cohen, 2001; Brehm &amp; Self, 1989; Trope &amp; Fishbach, 2000). These different theories have very different practical implications. If demanding conditions undermine self-regulation, people will be best off by avoiding demanding conditions. By contrast, if demanding conditions facilitate selfregulation, people may be advised to seek out demanding conditions whenever they can. In the present article, we develop an integrative theoretical analysis of how demanding conditions influence self-regulation. In what follows, we begin by taking a closer look at the basic ways in which demanding conditions might help or hurt self-regulation. Next, drawing upon action control theory (Kuhl, 1984, 1994a), we propose that the self-regulatory impact of demanding conditions depends on people’s mode of adapting to these</p>

<p>This paper examines and discusses the rules and standards set by parents for their children on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> usage at home. Data that supports the paper have been obtained by surveying a representative sample of children in the Balearic Islands aged between 6 and 16 years; the analysis dimensions are: access by minors to the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> from home; location of the computer from which have online access; level of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> or accompaniment while surfing the Net; norms imposed by their parents; types of rules imposed; relationship between norms and gender; the minors’ opinion and assessment of the knowledge and abilities of their parents on use of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and, finally, the accompanying strategies of parents when their children access the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. The main results shows that just over 53% of minors between 6 and 14, and 62% of those between 15 and 16, surf the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> without their parents’ presence and free of any norms and/or limitations. Where standards are established, these are mainly to do with temporary restrictions. Therefore, it appears that parents are unaware of the dangers of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> or at least act irrationally. This shows the need for awareness and provision of skills, knowledge and abilities to enable parents to assume their responsibilities in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> usage of minors.</p>

<p>This paper examines the key role of formal and informal social support in reducing digital inequalities by enabling the digital participation of older people. It is based primarily on research conducted on the Sustaining IT use by older people to promote <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and independence Sus-IT project in the UK over a four-year period working with over 1,000 older people using mixed research methods within a participative framework. It is further informed by other studies. The rich, multi-faceted evidence reveals on the one hand the extensive learning and support needs and requirements of older users of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies ICTs and, on the other, the dearth of reliable and ongoing support provision. ICT learning and support in the UK relies primarily on the goodwill of friends and family and on the availability of staff and volunteers in community venues, such as public libraries. Arrangements are often ad hoc and variable in quality and reliability. In a facilitated workshop, the learning and ICT support needs of older people and their preferred forms of provision were documented and deliberated. This generated a clear set of user requirements. To meet these requirements a proposition for community-based ICT support provision has been developed and refined. The paper concludes with consideration of this proposition which offers a powerful way to reduce the widespread digital inequalities among older people.</p>

<p>The majority of the extensive debate surrounding posthumous sperm procurement (PSP) focuses on how to respect the deceased man and his <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Policy and law also focus on the deceased’s interests, specifying the level of consent required. This article argues (using four hypothetical fact situations) that consent should not be the sole focus of ethical debate. Instead, a fuller picture should be examined, including the wishes and values of the prospective sperm donor; the future life and prospects of the resultant child; the needs and motivations of the mother, and other pertinent factors. In practice, this means that a committee acting judicially should consider each case. This is a practical option for New Zealand and Australia where applications for posthumous sperm procurement are not common but it also enables us to consider the ethical arguments in relation to such determinations in other jurisdictions.</p>

<p>Kenyans use mobile money services to transfer money to friends and relatives via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> text messaging. Kenya’s M-Pesa is one of the most successful examples of digital money for financial inclusion. This article uses social network analysis and ethnographic information to examine ties to and through women in 12 mobile money transfer networks of kin, drawn from field data collected in 2012, 2013, and 2014. The social networks are based on reciprocal and dense ties among siblings and parents, especially mothers. Men participate equally in social networks, but as brothers and mother’s brothers more often than as fathers. The matrilineal ties of mobile money circulate value within the hearthhold (Ekejiuba 2005) of women, their children, and others connected to them. Using remittances, families negotiate investments in household farming or work, education, and migration. Money sending supports the diverse economic strategies, flexible kinship ties, and mobility of hearthholds. Gifts of e-money are said to express a natural love and caring among mothers and siblings and are often private and personal. Consequently, the money circulations of the hearthhold avoid disrupting widely shared ideals of patrilineal solidarity and household <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.</p>

<p>Empowerment is a multi-dimensional process which should enable women or group of women to realise their full identity and power in all spheres of life. It consists of greater access to knowledge and resources, greater <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in decision-making to enable them to have greater ability to plan their lives or to have greater control over the circumstances that influence their lives and free from shocks imposed on them by custom, belief and practice. The status of the women is connected with their economic position or status which depends on their participation in economic activities such as ability to access credit, role in decision-making in financial matters and others. Social or domestic empowerment is a gradual process. Some variables had been selected to assess the impact of social empowerment among the informants in this paper, for example independent movement, expression of own view, undertaking decisions in familial matters, interaction with public bodies, participation in protest against social crimes and so on. The present qualitative has been conducted in the villages Amlani and Takipur of North 24 Parganas, West Bengal. The study is based on typical anthropological methodology under the domain of ethnographic approach. The contextual data have been collected through participant observations, intensive interviews and case studies. The data from books, journals, magazines and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> websites have also been utilised.</p>

<p>With the advancement of technology, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> it has become the primary means for audiovisual consumption while presenting a critical situation around the debate the quality of the content. With the emergence of DTT (Digital Terrestrial Television) in Spain television networks, public and private, they have created new thematics channels focused on content for children. At the same time, with the rise of new electronic devices such as tablets and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s, they have moved such content to the network by creating of platforms whose programs are aimed childhood. The non-linearity and immediacy in consumption make the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> becomes an active mean giving <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and freedom to access a multitude of content regardless of time and the device. In this situation the child consumers is the audience that worries both parents and educational institutions. Restless, therefore, that children do not find programs adjusted to their age. The quality concept harbors no concrete definition because of the multitude of factors and perspectives that influence it. This paper, and based on different measurement criteria set by countries like Argentina, Chile, Spain, France, Italy, Japan, Sweden, the University of Pennsylvania (USA) or the ACTF (Australian Children´s Television Foundation) poses as main objective to analyze the online platforms Clan RTVE, Neox Kidz and Boing of television TVE, Antena 3 and Telecinco, respectively, because they are considered spaces with audiovisual material created for children. With the intention of demonstrating that they are presented as quality environments for children who access them it will conduct a qualitative methodology. Using the content analysis technique to each of the animated titles we can say that the cartoons, as outlined above, are quality entertainment programs.</p>

<p>This article examines how journalists perceive workplace <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in five European countries, based on an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> survey (N = 2238) conducted in the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Sweden and Estonia. The article argues that the workplace level functions as a link between the macro level of external pressures and the micro level of perceived influences on news work. Using principal component analysis we explore the dimensionality of workplace <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> based on a set of 20 survey questions. Regression analysis is then used on the dimensions found in order to determine what affects perception of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the different dimensions. The most salient explanatory variables are found on the country and organisational levels, whereas the variables age, experience, gender, managerial role and medium have no or limited effects. The results show the organisational and country levels being integrated and that national journalistic culture is the most salient factor explaining perception of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.</p>

<p>Abstract Adolescence is a time when youth are faced with multiple tasks that intersect and influence one another, e.g., increased desire for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, salience of identity issues, peer orientation, self-focus and self-consciousness, and a continuing need for a safe environment in which to explore <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and identity. These all occur in a dynamic ecosystemic environment, which in the past would have mostly included family, peers, and school, but today also includes <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>space as both a system, and a means to interact with many other systems through the use of multiple forms of information technology (IT). This paper uses the voices and experiences of 128 adolescents, captured in qualitative interviews, to look at <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and identity in the digital age as they talk about their parents vis a vis their use of IT. Thematic analysis revealed two major themes: 1) Adolescents spoke of their expertise. In particular they commented on their knowledge to repair equipment, ability to use IT well, their sense of pride in their own ability and their parents’ acknowledgement of this ability. 2) Subjects perceived little need for their own supervision, but assessed that other adolescents and younger children needed to be watched closely by their parents. Implications of this work are discussed.</p>

<p>Affiliates of parent companies seeking localized control of their social message may adopt easily available <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms beyond the control of the parent IT function. A revelatory case identifies several IT control points by which the parent can still exert control over the affiliate. These controls separate the affiliate’s digital identity from the parent resulting in the perception of increased <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> yet shifting the conception of control to a social form of self-regulation.</p>

<p>In this paper, we argue that censorware is one of the bogeymen that instills fear in parents whose children have access to the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. It is a fear that has the potential to restrict children’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and opportunities for engagement in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. Fear regarding children’s online activities is one of the issues surrounding children’s <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> safety that does not appear to be situated in any particular social or cultural context. Among the most popular means of monitoring children online, censorware may prove even more harmful to children’s socioemotional wellbeing and development than any other form of monitoring (Boyd &amp; Jenkins, 2006; Cloke &amp; Jones, 2005; Helwig, 2006; Kamii, 1991; Laufer &amp; Wolfe, 1977; Marx &amp; Steeves, 2010; Pettit &amp; Laird, 2002; Rooney, 2010). Inherent in the design and use of censorware are structures that inhibit children’s online and offline social interactions, their ability to develop fully as social actors, and their experience of being empowered to make informed and critical decisions about their lives, including choices relating to privacy. As well, reliance on surveillance-based approach-es to monitoring online activities of chil-dren (aged 5-14) may actually be leading to a greater danger: a decrease in oppor-tunities for children to have experiences that help them develop <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and independence. Our inquiry is located within a growing body of research that addresses the social implications of restricting, surveilling and controlling young children’s online activities versus nurturing individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> through parental mentoring and critically reflec-tive software and social technology use.</p>

<p>The sex industry is increasingly operated through online technologies, whether this is selling services online through webcam or advertising, marketing or organising sex work through the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and digital technologies. Using data from a survey of 240 <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>-based sex workers (members of the National Ugly Mug reporting scheme in the UK), we discuss the working conditions of this type of work. We look at the basic working patterns, trajectories and everyday experiences of doing sex work via an online medium and the impact this has on the lives of sex workers. For instance, we look at levels of control individuals have over their working conditions, prices, clientele and services sold, and discuss how this is mediated online and placed in relation to job satisfaction. The second key finding is the experience of different forms of crimes individuals are exposed to such as harassment and blackmail via the new technologies. We explore the relationship <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>-based sex workers have with the police and discuss how current laws in the UK have detrimental effects in terms of safety and access to justice. These findings are placed in the context of the changing landscape of sex markets as the digital turn determines the nature of the majority of commercial sex encounters. These findings contribute significantly to the populist coercion/choice political debates by demonstrating levels and types of agency and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> experienced by some sex workers despite working in a criminalized, precarious and sometimes dangerous context.</p>

<p>This paper explores Buddhist images of the body, and in particularly the female body, as expressed in the Theragāthā and the Therīgāthā. In 1930 I. B. Horner argued that Buddhism brought women a level of equality, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and respect unprecedented in pre-Buddhist India. Women gained control over their own lives and were no longer seen as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>tel that could only live through and on a man. In Horner’s words, Buddhism not only challenged the caste system, “but also attempted to promote the cause of rights for women. While it is probably true that Buddhism offered women an outlet for self-expression which they otherwise would have found hard to find, it would be an exaggeration to claim that Buddhism championed women rights. From the beginning, the eight special rules for bhikkhunīs guaranteed that they would remain under the power of the bhikkhus. Furthermore, more recent research on women in Buddhism has highlighted that the Buddhist position toward women was both ambiguous and at times contradictory. On the one hand, women were seen as a danger to a man’s spiritual progress because of their perceived association with sensuality and procreation. On the other hand, Buddhism acknowledged that women were just as capable of achieving enlightenment as their male counterparts. The result was an attitude toward women which, while spiritually accepting, was at the same time infused with patriarchy and a male distrust of the feminine. Moreover, what the Theragāthā and the Therīgāthā suggest is that patriarchy was so pervasive in early Buddhism that the bhikkhunīs effectively adopted and internalized bhikkhus’ attitudes toward the female body.</p>

<p>ABSTRACTIn feminist literature, there is a sense that the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> amplifies women’s voices in a public sphere crowded by male domination. But how is this possible, when the attributes of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s (mobility, connectivity, sociability) contradict the socialisation of women, particularly in Africa, where a ‘desirable’ femininity entails withdrawal from public spaces, shyness and being mostly confined to domestic settings? Using domestication theory, this study explores these questions through in-depth interviews with young female and male students in three higher learning institutions in Harare. While the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> amplify the importance of identity construction and the psychological need by young women to formulate an empowering sense of self, there is a dialectical tension between the need for women’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> from disempowering social processes vis-a-vis conformity to social hierarchy. Overall, these technologies – among other more formal processes such as education and legislati…</p>

<p>David Barry Gaspar and Darlene Clark Hine, eds., Beyond Bondage: Free Women of Color in the Americas, Champaign, Illinois: University of Illinois Press, 2004, xi + 329 pp.Building on the success of More Than <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Chat</span>tel: Black Women and Slavery in the Americas (1996), their edited volume of essays on and enslaved black women, David Barry Gaspar and Darlene Clark Hine have collected another impressive set of essays analysing the lives of women in slave-based societies from across the Americas in their new, and in many ways complementary, volume. This remarkably balanced set of articles discusses women’s lives in a wide range of geographic settings, from Antigua west to New Orleans and from Kentucky south to Brazil; in rural and urban settings; and under a variety of imperial regimes, including Spanish, French, British and US. Comparisons among the conditions of women of colour are further enhanced by the chronological span of this book, beginning in the seventeenth century and continuing to the middle of the nineteenth.The breadth of coverage permits the reader to consider the lives and experiences of women of colour and, even more, to reconsider the very concepts of freedom and bondage. After all, how was a free woman of colour when social practices and legal restrictions still limited her self-determination? The editors conclude that women of colour could never completely escape slavery’s hold on their lives because colour prejudice, enforced by local precepts, curtailed their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, even if these restrictions occurred in different forms in the various settings represented in these essays.The editors divide the essays into two sections. The first chapters, listed under the heading Achieving and Preserving Freedom, describe the ways in which women obtained status, whether through marronage, self-purchase, lifetime or deathbed grant. In Martinique and Guadeloupe sheer laziness on the part of enslavers who demanded little or no work from their former bonds people, but also failed to complete the official procedures that would have allowed these women to enjoy documented manumission, left them in an in-between, quasifree, state as libres de fait. Documentation in other settings, such as the US South, left officially free women of colour in quasi freedom. As late as 1861, US women of colour occasionally sought to re-enslave themselves because of the limited opportunities that they were offered to support themselves and their children, or they would be forced to leave their still-enslaved family members under state laws that exiled persons of colour manumitted after specified dates. …</p>

<p>Infantile Anorexia (IA), defined by the Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood Revised (DC: 0-3R, Zero To Three, 2005), occurs when the child (a) refuses to eat adequate amounts of food for at least 1 month, and shows growth deficiency, (b) does not communicate hunger and lacks interest in food, and (c) the child’s food refusal does not follow a traumatic event and is not due to an underlying medical illness. IA usually emerges during the transition to self-feeding, when the child issues of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> are played out daily in the feeding situation. Studies evidence that the feeding interactions between children with IA and their mothers are characterized by low reciprocity, greater interactional conflict and negative affects (<span style="background-color:lightgreen">Chat</span>oor et al., 2000; Ammaniti et al., 2010, 2012). Moreover, these studies pointed out that maternal depression and eating disorders are frequently associated with IA (Cooper et al., 2004; Ammaniti et al., 2010; Lucarelli et al., 2013). To date, research has focused almost exclusively on the mother-child dyad, while fathers’ involvement, co-parental and family interactions are poorly studied. The current study is a pilot research that investigated mother-father-child triadic interactions, during feeding and play, in families with children diagnosed with IA, in comparison to families with normally developing children. Until now, at the study participated N = 10 families (five with a child with IA diagnosis and five with lack of child’s IA diagnosis, matched for child’s age and gender). The parents-child triadic interactions were assessed in feeding and play contexts using the Lausanne Trilogue Play (Fivaz-Depeursinge and Corboz-Warnery, 1999), adapted to observe father-mother-infant primary triangle in the feeding context, compared to the play context (Lucarelli et al., 2012). Families of the IA-group showed difficulties in expressing and sharing pleasure and positive affects, and in structuring a predictable and flexible context. Children showed little <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and difficulty in being actively engaged and tune with parents. Dysfunctional family interactions are a critical issue for IA that affects co-parental and family subsystems, stressing the importance of an articulated diagnostic assessment in order to target effective treatment approaches.</p>

<p>Emerging adults are encountering a developmental stage in a polymediated world that brings <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, intimacy, and identity to the forefront of their transition from adolescence to adulthood. This study focuses on traditionally-aged college students who are deeply immersed with digital technology and communication as a primary method to communicate and interact with peers, partners, teachers, and family members. To understand the relationship between digital communication and emerging adulthood, researchers facilitated a qualitative study grounded in ethnomethodological and dramaturgical perspective to uncover the unique ways in which college students make sense of their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> during this developmental time period. Data collection occurred through nine focus groups; in all, 44 undergraduate students participated. Findings illustrate four relevant patterns to the development of emerging adults: a key rationale for use among participants that is tied to both ritualized behavior and institutional constraints; the importance of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> with their digital communication use that is often stifled by parental access to their mediated lives; the presentation of an identity that is rooted in norms of acceptable use; and the importance of digital communication to the development and maintenance of connections to family, friends, and intimate partners. Implications for further research are discussed.</p>

<p>Historically, parents looking for guidance turned to a small cadre of trusted individuals such as grandparents and pediatricians. In the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> era, this paradigm has shifted. With a few keystrokes, anxious parents have access to a seemingly endless array of opinions from faceless sources with unknown agendas. For some parents, this can cause more uncertainty, and for the parents of a child with a medical condition, navigating this information can be overwhelming.</p>
<p>In this modern paradigm, the pediatrician’s duty has also become more complex, especially with the shift from paternalism to patient <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in medical decision-making. It is within this context that Alan Fleischman’s book, Pediatric Ethics: Protecting the Interests of Children, should be examined. A pediatrician and neonatologist, Fleischman has witnessed this evolution over more than five decades of practice. As a clinical and academic bioethicist, he has also witnessed a transformation in the field of bioethics, with shifting perspectives on areas such as research ethics and medical decision-making. Because of his rich experience and deep understanding of the past and present of ethical issues in pediatrics, Fleischman approaches this subject with a perspective that warrants attention and thoughtful consideration.</p>

<p>Due to increasing globalization and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> communication, the number of international marriages has increased. In Sweden, 75% of the Thai population are women, among whom 80% are partnered with Swedish or other Scandinavian men. Previous studies have indicated that lack of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, social isolation, and stigma are important risk factors for poor mental health for foreign-born women as well as for women in international marriages.To explore what characterizes the processes, choices, challenges and relational conditions that Thai women, partnered with Swedish or Danish men, experience during their first years in Sweden.A qualitative study using a Constructivist Grounded Theory approach based on fourteen individual interviews with Thai women partnered with Swedish or Danish men and residing in Sweden.The core category ‘possibilities to maintain a strong self in Sweden’ is linked to five categories characterizing the process that the women go through over time. The subcategories illustrate different paths taken even if there were possibilities to change paths along the way. The women had, for different reasons, reached a turning point that made them leave Thailand. In Sweden, they started in dependency and struggled in different ways to adjust to relational norms and handle prejudice. Toward the end of the timeline, differing ways of recognizing life choices depended on access to social networks and partners’ attitudes.Our study showed the crucial role of economical, emotional and social support from partners and networks for Thai women’s possibilities to maintain a strong self and good health after migration. This implies a need for supporting Thai women to be more independent by providing access to language education, employment and community involvement. The current requirement for becoming a permanent resident should also be reviewed not to jeopardize women international marriages possibilities’ to leave unhealthy relationships.</p>

<p>This paper shows the most outstanding clues of the last iconic revolution on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. The quantity and the quickness of image re-production on the digital net is amazing but the web is far more important as a communication arena and as an opportunity to show up authors’ and amateurs’ works. The web allows everybody to approach the world through its digital copy and to upload, download or modify iconic contents. So during a potential never-ending process the image can have multiple, sometimes unknown, authors. The web-people can find on the web opportunities to create a new digital citizenship and to gather around a parallel word of icons which can have a prospective endless life as traces on the net.</p>

<p>This article is the result of an exploratory research carried out in 2014-2015 in the region Marche on an issue that is causing public alarm, despite his knowledge is still approximate and may not be confined to criminal or psychological matters. The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying is closely connected to the processes of children’s identity construction, of the relation to the peer group and of the definition of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> trough which they can free themselves from the control of adults. It is an issue that can be read even from a gender perspective because if the victims are mostly girls, the peculiar procedures enable girls to behave as bullies. Furthermore many of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying acts have to do with the body representation and the models of masculinity and femininity that define the imaginary of teenagers. The aim is going beyond the focus on the digital tools and their possible emotional damage for looking at the contents that reproduce sexism and oppression which is not often recognized as problematic.</p>

<p>Port Moresby is consistently represented as a place that is dangerous for women. While recent transformations in the city have benefited some more than others, developments in the city are allowing for the creation of new ‘spatial texts’ in a place notorious for constraining women. In this article, I explore feminist geographer Linda McDowell’s idea that the city is a place in which the active, independent woman comes into her own. Drawing on focus groups, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s and photos sent to me by educated, ‘middle class’ Papua New Guinean women living in Port Moresby, I demonstrate that the city’s new places are paradoxical, even liberating places. The article reveals both the extent of women’s subordination in the city and the emerging possibilities for middle class women to experience a degree of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Nevertheless as Radice notes, women must endlessly renegotiate their experience of comfort in relation to others, including those whose lives are less comfortable.</p>

<p>This Essay argues that the battle over women’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, especially their reproductive healthcare and decision-making, has always been about much more than simply women’s health and safety. Rather, upholding patriarchy and dominion over women’s reproduction historically served political purposes and entrenched social and cultural norms that framed women’s capacities almost exclusively as service to a husband, mothering, reproducing, and sexual <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>tel. In turn, such social norms—often enforced by statutes and legal opinions—took root in rhetoric rather than the realities of women’s humanity, experiences, capacities, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and lived lives. As such, law created legal fictions about women and their supposed lack of intellectual and social capacities. Law trapped women to the destinies courts and legislatures aspired for them and continues to do so. This Essay turns to the less engaged international sphere and the copious Congressional Record to unpack how the Helms Amendment and later, the Mexico City Policy (or Global Gag Rule), emerged from this type of lawmaking. This Essay shows how these harmful dictates on women’s lives and bodies in developing nations result in a deadly rise of illegal abortions, criminal punishments, stigmatization, and sadly, deaths.</p>

<p>In recent years in Serbia - but also in recent decades in many other countries in the world - an intensive campaign of various social (most often <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>) groups against compulsory vaccination of children has taken place. Except for the pseudo-scientific study of Andrew Wakefield (1998), which has since been contested several times in serious scientific researches, as well as a few medical doctors in Serbia who referred to it, the whole of expert stakeholders, and epidemiologists in particular, has fiercely opposed the dangerous trend of parents renouncing compulsory vaccination of their children. This article aims to show that the consent to compulsory vaccination of children is not a matter of the right to <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the field of medicine - which implies the freedom of every human being to decide on one’s own life and body - but instead a matter of public health, which inevitably means of public interest as well, a matter which should be decided by competent professionals.</p>

<p>Literature points out the role of parenting on adolescent <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying involvement. However, it is necessary to clarify how gender affects this relationship. The aim of this study has been to examine the relation between the adolescents’ perception about parenting practices, and their involvement in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying, bearing in mind both girls’ and boys’ gender and progenitors’ gender. The sample comprised 2060 Spanish secondary school students (47.9% girls; Mage = 14.34). Two-way ANOVA and binary logistic regression analyses were carried out. An effect of the interaction between sex and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying roles in maternal affection and communication, inductive discipline, and psychological control, as well as paternal promotion of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and psychological control, was found. In general, it can be observed that the more negative results were found in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-aggressors, especially when this role is assumed by girls. The results of logistic regression analysis suggest that parenting practices explain better <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying involvement in girls compared to boys, finding some important differences between both sexes regarding protective and risk factors. These findings highlight the importance of parenting practices to explain <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying involvement, which supports the necessity of including family among the addresses of intervention programs.</p>

<p>The penetration of new media among the very young and in particular the use of tablets and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s, objects considered “natural” by children because they were already present at birth, made the analysis scenario very complex.&nbsp; As usual more or less consolidated in recent years, the phone arrives in the first year (eleven years) almost for all preadolescents. A conventional choice that comes from below, shared by the families of any social status, from the south or the north, young or less young and which we could define as ethical-pragmatic, answers two questions: the first, of a moral character, reflects the idea that children under the age of 11 have not yet acquired the cognitive tools to manage this new technological object and its consequences in “social” life; the second, more practical, believes that the phone can be useful for kids 11 years and older who will start going to school alone. But how will the life of the eleven years change with the arrival of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>? What will happen in their universe will be a small Copernican revolution, they will discover the possibility of always being connected, they will feel the need to be in a group, in a network, suffer exclusion or disinterest, they will be tempted to destroy the sense of boredom with any online game. Through a telephone, their first form of private property, will claim the right to privacy (block codes or even worse fingerprints), will experience the first forms of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. In short, they will experience adult life.</p>

<p>Exposure to ideal body types in the media has been consistently linked to reduced body satisfaction. Images posted on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s may also impact body satisfaction by portraying idealised standards of physical attractiveness promoted by peers. This study draws on self-determination theory to examine whether satisfaction of basic psychological needs (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness) protects against the negative effect of viewing <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> images depicting an ideal body type on body satisfaction. Female (n = 141) and male (n = 48) university students were randomly assigned to view either a body-ideal image or a travel image presented on a mock <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> profile. Viewing body-ideal imagery resulted in significantly lower body satisfaction compared to viewing travel imagery (d = -0.37). Satisfaction of the needs for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and competence predicted higher baseline body satisfaction; however, none of the psychological needs protected against the negative effect of viewing body-ideal imagery on body satisfaction. Limitations included brief exposure to a single <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> image and use of a convenience sample. Future research may benefit from measuring body image-specific rather than general psychological need satisfaction to predict state changes in body satisfaction.</p>

<p>Author(s): Geisser, Lauren | Abstract: Some of the largest companies in the world—including <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> and Apple—began offering cryopreservation (aka, egg freezing) as a covered employee benefit as early as 2014. This Article discusses the ramifications of such coverage on other diversity policies and employee benefits, as well as with respect to class and racial inequality, and gender-normative societal roles.Egg freezing is an elective procedure to preserve a woman’s eggs by extracting, freezing and storing them until she is ready to get pregnant at a later point in time. Similar to how the Pill allowed women to defer pregnancy and invest in their careers in the 1970s, some see egg freezing as the ultimate breakthrough to level the playing field for women so that they can have both a career and motherhood. However, when an employer subsidizes that choice, and does so over other employee benefits such as paid parental leave, childcare or flexible work arrangements, the employer reinforces the dominant—yet as this Article shows, flawed—view that motherhood is incompatible with work.Indeed, our society was founded on notions of individual rights and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and egg freezing benefits claim to provide a woman with the choice to put her eggs on ice as she focuses on her career, financial stability, and finding a partner. This Article demonstrates that while potentially beneficial in the short term to recruit women and diversify the workplace, egg freezing coverage is more likely to aggravate class and racial inequality and disrupt the movements for supportive employee benefits and a restructuring of the societal norms of gender roles. With movements such as Time’s Up and #MeToo rallying women and men around the world, it is time to bring to light and question notions of traditional gender roles that companies may in effect be reinforcing.</p>

<p>Abstract Physical frailty represents a clinical condition among older adults leading to adverse health outcomes, such as <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> loss. To evaluate physical frailty in older adults, adopting <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICT) may be useful. ADAMO (Caretek S.r.l.) is a care-watch accelerometer that allows to measure mobility in a non-intrusive way (Magistro et al., 2018) providing wider information on individual general health (Mulasso et al., in press). The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between indoor mobility, physical frailty and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in a sample of Italian older adults. Methods: Thirty-two volunteers (age 65–84 years; women 56.2%) participated in the study. All wore ADAMO care-watch continuously over a 7-day period. The number of steps indoor was the main endpoint. Fragmented daily mobility was estimated. Physical frailty and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> were measured using the Tilburg Frailty Indicator (physical components) and the Groningen Activity Restriction Scale, respectively. Results: Significant inverse correlations were observed between number of steps and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and number of steps and physical frailty. Conversely, a significant direct correlation was observed between physical frailty and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Additionally, mediation analysis demonstrated full mediation effect of physical frailty between the number of steps and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Our results imply that high indoor mobility per se can reduce physical frailty and consequently helps to maintain <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Conclusions: Indoor mobility captured by ADAMO accelerometer may be an important indicator of physical frailty and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. ADAMO may be used as a non-intrusive telemonitoring solution to capture relevant information on individual general health in aged people.</p>

<p>The amount of time adolescents spend communicating via digital technologies such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s has led to concerns that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">computer-mediated</span> communication (CMC) is displacing face-to-face (FtF) interactions and disrupting social development. Although many studies have examined CMC in adolescents’ relationships with friends, few studies have examined the role of CMC in adolescents’ renegotiation of closeness and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> with parents. To examine this issue, we administered an online daily diary with 169 U.S. adolescents to estimate the time they spend in CMC and FtF interactions and the number of texts they exchange with friends and parents. On the last day of the survey, we asked adolescents about their emotional closeness to friends and parents and their balance of closeness and volition with parents. Overall, we found more evidence for social stimulation than displacement effects of CMC. Texts and CMC time with friends predicted friend closeness after accounting for FtF time with friends; texts with parents predicted parent closeness after accounting for FtF time with parents. We also found support for our hypothesis that CMC would be associated with greater adolescent volition. CMC time with parents predicted greater volitional dependence (volition plus closeness) whereas texts with friends predicted greater independent decision-making (volition plus distance). We discuss how communication technologies are integrated into U.S. adolescents’ relationships with friends and parents and how CMC can facilitate, rather than stifle, adolescents’ adjustment of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-relatedness with parents and their construction of emotional closeness with friends.

<p>Abstract This paper focuses on gender influences on life space mobility based on distance from home traveled by elderly retirees. Consideration of life space travel offers a window into environmental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and complexity in late life. The gendered nature of time use and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networks have been primarily studied in younger age groups. Our sample included 437 older adults (mean age 83 for both men and women) living in a large Florida retirement community that offered no services. Mean age was 83 for both men and women. Fewer (37.6%) women than men (69.7%) were married and more men drove a car (83% vs 63%).Women reported poorer subjective health and had more IADL limitations. Compared to women, men were significantly more likely to travel long distances. Women’s weekly and monthly travel tended to be local, limited to their neighborhood. On average, respondents of both genders visite</span>d their families and friends out of town every month. Better health, current driving and volunteering were related to longer driving distances for both genders, but these advantages were no longer significant after controlling for demographic characteristics. Our findings underscore the complex relationships between gender and life space travel in late life. Even among elderly men and women of the same age better health and driving resources contribute to larger life space for elderly men.</p>

<p>Rape is the most severe sexual offense, involving one of the most feared and reviled acts a person can inflict on another. But what makes something rape? Initially, only penial-vagina forceful penetration; then, other forceful penial penetrations were added, oral and anal; and later the forceful insertion of inanimate objects as well. The requirement of using force lost its exclusiveness and much of its normative power, paving the way for other kinds of rape: sex by non-forceful coercion, sex by sedation, sex with incompetent victims, sex by fraud, and other forms of problematic sex. The normative debate about each form is ongoing, and in a manner of speaking, rape is a limitless idea. Where will the rape offense go next?</p>
<p><span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span>space, apparently. The Israeli Supreme Court has recently affirmed convictions of rape performed by distant words. The perpetrators conversed with children, teenagers and adult women online, using fraud and blackmail to manipulate them into masturbation and self-penetration. This groundbreaking judicial development is the inspiration to a normative analysis, revolving around Western notions of rape. Should such ill-intended communications constitute rape?</p>
<p>The article will normatively scrutinize the virtual rape thesis. It will analytically deconstruct the normative notion of rape into three facets, and examine each separately: the physics of the offensive scenario; the settings thereof, the manner in which sexual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is violated; and finally, the matter of proper criminal labeling. It will conclude that while sexual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is indeed under attack in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>space, the framework of rape is unsuitable to handle this form of offensiveness.</p>

<p>The contradictory media messages, even paradoxical, make many parents think that to have a child changes nothing in their lives. However, to grow, the baby requires initially that is established a narrow dependence between him and his/her parents, so that, in the second time, he can take his <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. With through its experiment clinical and a review of a certain number of media messages, the author shows how much certain adults are in lack of reference, which prevents them from correctly transmitting the limits essential to child education. The concept of extimity and the problems of the sexualisation of the culture are also approached. Lastly, media used by children (video games and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>) are analyzed. A strategy of parentality assistance is then proposed.</p>

<p>This study analyses the psycho-educational and social paths of women prisoners after the time they drop out of school as minors, based on different variables related to <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and their preparedness to face temporary release.Qualitative and quantitative methods were used to analyse a national sample of 310 women prisoners (30.1% of the population) in 31 prisons through a mixed-mode questionnaire and interview. We analysed the significant association of variables related to dropout and obtained a log-linear model that relates dropout to recidivism and Roma culture. Work experience was analysed using the McNemar test, and variables influencing the participant’s job at the time of the study were analysed by applying cluster analysis.Young women comprise 66.6% of individuals who drop of the education system as minors (primary 49.3% and secondary 22%). They drop out between the ages of 7 and 17, and have traits of greater vulnerability than those who stayed in school until adulthood. In this population, we find a significant association with various factors: belonging to Roma culture, having family members in prison and delinquent recidivism; and higher unemployment (43.4%) and low income before entering prison. This situation is increasing today. In prison, these women had more connection to education/training, which can improve their employability. They also encounter difficulties with personal security, decision-making, personal/professional dependence, planning for the future, administrative matters and handling <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies, job-seeking skills, etc. Their self-perceived strengths are, however, assuming responsibility, taking orders, respecting schedules and timetables, working on a team and feeling prepared to start a job, as well as having optimistic convictions about the future.The vulnerabilities and risk factors studied have a negative influence primarily on processes of personal, social and job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in female minors who left the education system. Yet these minors show factors of protection and resilience. On temporary release at the time of the study, they face the consequences that their prison terms and incarceration have for their perceptions, attitudes, competencies and future prospects, as well as social marginalization and stigma. Early, coherent socio-educational interventions are thus needed to improve social integration-reintegration.</p>

<p>This article examines the representation and use of quality time. It brings together an analysis of images tagged and shared under the hashtag #qualitytime on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Instagram</span> with an investigation into the trope’s resonance in everyday life. In the interviews and profiles studied in this article, people used the term to indicate and display instances of self-determined solitude or of fulfilling conviviality in which <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> were conspicuously absent. At the same time, the notion required them to carve out and valorize moments of purpose, a goal that was often unattainable. Use of the hashtag was thus accompanied by both the opportunity and the obligation to aspire to temporary retreats in which free time was employed for meaningful activity. This means that the somewhat pretentious keyword signifies the ideal of temporal <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> while also pointing to the slim chance of finding uncompromised spells of time within harried leisure.</p>

<p>I am a married woman. I am also a working woman. I love what I do. And I am actually paid to do what I love. Yet, everyday I return home from work with a heavy heart. No.&nbsp;My workplace poses no threats. Although many working women across the world would disagree with me; but fortunately, I am not one of them. My greatest threat is my returning home to my in-laws and tolerating their snide comments on my being out all day. The men in the house can do it. That is not a problem. But my going and staying out to work is a matter of domestic debate. I usually don’t retaliate. But I cannot help brooding over, from time to time, how unfair life still is towards women. When you really think about it, the fact that women all over the world are still fighting for equal rights defies all logic. Humans have mastered flight, walked on the moon and created the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> but women still can’t be trusted to make autonomous decisions about their own bodies, be guaranteed freedom from violence or harassment or get paid the same amount as men for doing the same damn work. From time to time, many women have voiced their disgruntlement over the gender inequality. Anita Desai is one such powerful and persuasive voice among the writers, endeavouring in all her works to reflect the how the female <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> strives to prove its existence in a strictly patriarchal cultural pattern. This paper seeks to refer to one of her novels, Bye, Bye Black Bird (1971) to highlight the way man-woman relationships are bedevilled by cultural encounters. The novel deals with alienation of an English lady, Sarah, married to Adit, an immigrant from India, who spends her days wallowed in the guilt of committing a mistake of marrying an Indian in her own society. In spite of being a woman from the so-called advanced west, she is quiet, meek and submissive; while Adit, behaves most of the time, like a typical Indian male, conservative, rigid and patriarchal. Through Sarah, Desai draws our attention to the annihilation of self that marriage involves for a female, through a recurring theme of insecurity, fragmentation, homelessness and the quest for identity among different communities across the world.</p>

<p>Indonesia is expected to reap the benefits of a golden generation, enjoying an advanced and independent modern society in the year of 2045. However, there are great challenges ahead including problems amongst younger Indonesians which may hinder the realization of this projection. This study brings to the fore the problem of teenage marriage, defined as the marriage of two individuals under the age of eighteen, be it through coercion or through their own volition. Data show that 14.18% of married Indonesian women are younger than 16 years old (SUSENAS, 2017); with 1.459,000 teenage girls marrying per annum so that the country ranks eighth globally in terms of teenage marriage (UNICEF, 2020). Using a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netics communication approach and qualitative method, this article assesses teenage marriage prevention programs in Rembang, a regency in middle Java, Indonesia. This study found that prevention of teenage marriage is not part of everyday discussion in the grassroots. Public discourse has stalled at the information stage, optimal understanding has yet to be realized. With this backdrop, Rembang regency utilize a top-down approach in organizing its teenage marriage prevention programs. However, synergy and cooperation remain necessary to minimize the practice by maximizing collaboration with families, schools, health officials, religious officials, and civil servants who turn to be the most influential actors in such programs.</p>

<p>This study aims to examine the characteristics of grandparent–grandchild relationships made possible by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies (ICTs). An online questionnaire survey gathered the views of 169 grandmothers and grandfathers. On the one hand, it asked them generically about their possession of ICTs, their ICT skills, and their family relationships. On the other hand, it asked about their relationship with one of their grandchildren according to the ICTs used and the relational functions performed, particularly in relation to the age of the grandchild chosen. The grandparents who responded to our survey are very well equipped with ICTs and have good ICT skills. They frequently use them for both personal and family use. They communicate with their grandchildren in ways that are adapted to the grandchild’s age and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. These are more intense with the youngest grandchildren, and encourage a resumption of exchanges in later adolescence. While the choice of communication methods depends in part on the age of the grandchild, the relational functions performed seem to be more structured by the developmental stage of the grandchild than by the technical characteristics of ICTs. Our data also confirm that while ICTs can make it possible to maintain a link with grandchildren who live far away, they mainly enrich an otherwise existing relationship.</p>

<p>Abstract In contemporary society, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICTs) are widely cherished for helping transnational households preserve a coherent sense of familyhood despite geographical separation. Despite ICTs having positive benefits for the maintenance of long-distance intimacies, digital asymmetries characterized by gaps in routines, emotional experiences, and outcomes of ICT use can also emerge between family members of different structural, social, and geographical conditions. Drawing on an innovative “content–context diary”-cum-participant observation, this article investigates the multi-dimensional digital asymmetries emerging from the transnational communication of Chinese “study mothers” in Singapore. Using the data visualization and analysis tool “ecomap,” the findings uncover that study mothers were largely beleaguered by expectation asymmetry and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> asymmetry, arising from different expectations to and control over daily transnational communication with their family members. The study mothers were disadvantaged by their relatively isolated life situations in the host society and accentuated gender hierarchies in the household.</p>

<p>The purpose of the article is to consider the process of transformation of the image of a woman and the dominant family model in the main historical periods in the national female periodicals from the end of the 18th century to the present days. The authors note that the image of a woman in the gender media is changing due to the changes in the global and local agenda, in particular, due to the changes in the position of a woman in the family, the structure of a family, and decreasing of the number of family members. These transformations can also be explained by the change in the state’s requests for the promotion of a certain image, for example, the image of a patriotic woman during the Second World War and a mother woman in the post-war period. Over the course of many historical periods, rubrics devoted to the arrangement of everyday life, the relationship of the sexes, health and beauty, and motherhood remain the traditional rubrics of women’s publications. During more than two hundred years of publications, the image of a woman in them has gone through stages from primordial patriarchal models through a surge of individualization and independence to a moderate combination of the role of the homemaker and the installation of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> from men. The article also outlines the main trends in the development of modern women’s online publications, which, on the one hand, have inherited the theme and structure of traditional women’s magazines, and on the other, have the features of blogs. If certain characteristic images of a woman in the press gain or lose relevance, the changes in the family model in women’s media can be considered irreversible: there is no return to the image of a patriarchal multi-generational family. The study was based on the methods of historical review, thematic analysis and content analysis of publications of women’s magazines of various historical periods.

<p>Abstract Background There is a compelling need to prepare our societies and healthcare systems to deal with the oncoming wave of population ageing. The majority of older persons maintain a desire to be valued and useful members of society and of their social networks. Aims We sought to investigate the perception of usefulness among persons aged 65 years and over in four European countries. Methods We performed a cross-sectional survey with a representative sample of individuals aged 65 years or older from the population of retired persons (including recently retired persons and oldest-old individuals) from 4 European countries selected using quota sampling. In February 2016, an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> questionnaire was sent to all selected individuals. The characteristics used for the quota sampling method were sex, age, socio-professional category, region, city size, number of persons in household, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, marital status, place of residence, income and educational status. The questionnaire contained 57 questions. Sociodemographic characteristics were recorded. Responses were analysed with principal components analysis (PCA). Results A total of 4025 persons participated; 51% were males, and 70% were aged 65–75 years. PCA identified six classes of individuals, of which two classes (Classes 2 and 3) were characterized by more socially isolated individuals with little or no sense of usefulness, low self-esteem and a poor sense of well-being. These two classes accounted for almost 20% of the population. Younger and more autonomous classes reported a more salient sense of usefulness. Conclusions The loss of the sense of usefulness is associated with dissatisfaction with life and a loss of pleasure, and persons with profiles corresponding to Classes 2 and 3 should, therefore, be targeted for interventions aimed at restoring social links.</p>

<p>It has been recommended that parents monitor their children’s <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use, including what sites they visit, what messages they receive, and what they post. In this paper, I argue that parents ought not follow this advice, because to do so would violate a child’s right to privacy over their on-line information exchanges. In defense of this claim, I argue that children have a right to privacy from their parents, because it respects their current capacities and fosters their future capacities for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and relationships.</p>

<p>D. Clash between the privacy of children, UNCRC’S evolving capacities principle, and the freedom of commercial expression and speech It seems that the main dilemma in the matter of children participating in reality programs is the clash between two weighty interests: children’s rights and privacy on one hand, and commercial freedoms of expression and speech on the other. We begin with children’s rights, (163) including children’s dignity and the protection of their interests, which are all internationally recognized rights under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC). (164) Among the rights that could harmed are the child’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (165) and mental health. (166) There is also breach of privacy, (167) an important and internationally recognized value for children, (168) because they experience public emotional turmoil and cannot choose their audience and what to expose. (169) Intense and extensive exposure such as re-runs often results in hurt feelings and damage to the child’s personality. (170) Parents and broadcasters have a duty to protect children’s privacy. (171) Matters of the individual’s right to privacy, such as the prohibition against exposing a medical or emotional condition, or any other information about the individual’s private life, must not debatable. As discussed below, there is disagreement over other forms of violations of privacy. Paragraph 5 of the UNCRC describes the principle of evolving capacities. (172) According to this principle, children have certain inherent rights from the moment they are born, such as the right to food or security. (173) But other rights–autonomous rights–are granted to them gradually, according to their age and abilities, both physical and emotional. (174) This is so they will protected as they age, rather than be abandoned to their (175) Thus, for example, children are protected from being exposed to matters that are not suitable for their age that may cause them harm, supposedly in the name of fulfilling their rights. (176) The evolving capacities principle is also applicable when defining age groups for consent and participation in reality television. At times, children can care less about their privacy than adults. (177) Modern day children are active on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and frequently expose details about themselves on social networks. Therefore, at least at certain ages, it can assumed that they give genuine consent to such exposure, inasmuch as they control it. (178) Children do not give genuine consent when it comes to reality programs because broadcasters sometimes take advantage of their desire to become famous and thus their consent is not real. One must remember that children are not unionized nor are they considered employees, and in most countries there is no specific legislation that protects them. (179) When children expose their lives on a reality program, one must take a more paternalistic approach than one does with adults, and not leave them to their (180) In contrast to social networks, children cannot respond to a broadcast that portrays them in a certain way. This is even more important if the child did not agree to exposed on the program, and it was their parents’ wish that they filmed, as in docu-reality cases or on Nanny 911. The first natural and obvious protection against breaches of privacy is the parents’ and children’s consent, which serves also as contractual consent. It is possible to compare this situation to that of public figures, who are exposed by virtue of the positions they chose. (181) In this comparison, participants in reality programs who chose to exposed should also not have the right to privacy, or they should have only a weaker version of that right because they made their choice and they want to become famous. (182) But the situation is more complex, especially if a child’s consent is uninformed. We must also ask whether the children want to become famous at any cost. …</p>

<p>The article attempts to clarify the peculiarities of sex education in different countries of the European macro-region, based on countries-the founders and emphasize the most characteristic features of these countries in this aspect. In particular, the author focuses on Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Germany and France in the field of sex education of students who have laid the foundations of modern school sex education in Europe, paying special attention to gender policy, EU legal framework and Council of Europe in the field of school education. In Belgium, for example, society has a liberal attitude towards sex and sex education, moreover, sex education is a compulsory practice that offers schools considerable <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the development of curricula, including sex education. Italy is strongly influenced by the Catholic Church, so sex education is controversial in schools, and sex education programs are implemented as part of traditional classroom instruction, focusing mainly on the biological aspects of gender and behavior, adhering to the formation of traditional views on gender issues. based on the principles of morality. Luxembourg has open views on the issue of youth sexuality, the Netherlands shows one of the lowest levels of teenage pregnancy in the world, and the Dutch approach is often seen as a model for other countries. Attitudes toward sex education in Germany are characterized as liberal, accepted and recognized by federal law. This is due to the declining birth rate, which currently requires a rethinking of the position of politicians and the church on sex education and sex education of young people, while continuing to recognize the right of every citizen of the state to start a family. Sex education in France has a holistic approach and plays an important role in the sexual and emotional development of young people, helping them to resist the influence of the media and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. Improving the national systems of school sex education in the studied countries requires the formation of an effective gender policy in each country.</p>

<p>Although precise statistics do not exist, data suggests that the number of children believed to be at risk for commercial sexual exploitation in the United States is between 200,000 and 300,000 and that the average age of entry is between eleven and fourteen, with some as young as nine. The number of prostituted children who are criminally prosecuted for these acts is equally difficult to estimate. In 2008—the most recent year for which data is available—approximately 1500 youth under age eighteen were reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation as having been arrested within United States borders for prostitution and commercialized sex. Anecdotal evidence suggests, however, that these numbers reflect only a small fraction of the children who face criminal charges as a result of their prostituted status. Research also reveals that because most states have laws that hold children criminally liable for ―selling‖ sex, law enforcement and the courts readily pathologize these youth, a significant  Assistant Professor of Law, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Law (tbirckhe@<span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>.unc.edu).

Statistics additionally suggest that the number of American girls who are sexually exploited is increasing, particularly for those between the ages of thirteen and seventeen. Likewise, it is estimated that eighty percent of prostituted women began this activity when they, themselves, were younger than eighteen. Yet, nearly all states can criminally prosecute children for prostitution even when they are too young to legally consent to sex with adults, and very few communities have developed effective programs designed to prevent or intervene in the sexual exploitation of youth. This Article critically examines the prevalence of laws allowing for the criminal prosecution of minors for prostitution. It argues that rather than maintain a legal scheme that characterizes and treats such juveniles as willing participants who, if harmed, are merely getting what they deserve, a more nuanced approach must be developed in which—at a minimum— criminal liability should be consistent with age of consent and statutory rape laws. It analyzes the range of ways in which states have addressed the problem of prostituted children, and it highlights those few that have successfully utilized strategies of intervention and rehabilitation rather than prosecution and incarceration. It contrasts the impact of state versus federal legislation as well as domestic versus international policy in this area and examines the ways in which these differences serve to perpetuate pernicious stereotypes vis-a-vis youth and crime. The Article addresses the historical treatment of prostituted children as criminals rather than victims by both American law and society, and critiques contemporary rationales for continuing a punitive approach toward these youth. The Article explores the conflicting statutory, common law, and colloquial meanings of the terms ―prostitution,‖ ―consent,‖ and ―bodily <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>‖ as they relate to children and sexuality. It also considers the extent to which the criminal offenses of prostitution and statutory rape address different sets of harms and explores how gender and sexual orientation are implicated in the discussion. The Article concludes by highlighting model programs directed at prevention, intervention, and rehabilitation, as well as proposing strategies for reform, such as decriminalization and diversion.

This includes an absence of temporal and spatial boundaries of children’s culture, the mediated nature of its members’ contacts, the involvement of children in the network, the existence of culture in external memory, the electronic character of culture creations and their ephemeral and peculiar nature.

<p>The article examines the content and application of the principle of inadmissibility of interference in family life. It is established that the principle of inadmissibility of interference in family life is one of the key in family law and contains signs of intersectoral. Proper guarantee of non-interference in family life is an integral part of a person’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and an indicator of the state’s fulfillment of the obligation to regulate family relations only to a minimum.
 She studied the provisions of international acts (the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms) and the national legislation of Ukraine. It was found that different terminology is used in international and national acts, but the fixed concepts are meaningful content of the principle of inadmissibility of interference in family life.
 An analysis of the case law of the European Court of Human Rights on the understanding of the concept of “family life”. It has been established that the ECtHR interprets the term “family life” quite broadly and is not limited to marital relations, but may cover other actual “family ties”.
 Attention is drawn to the problem of collecting private information about a person via the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. Analysis of human activity on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> in general, as well as on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networks should not be carried out without his consent. That is why it is proposed at the level of legislation to provide for the obligation of both developers of computer programs that analyze human actions and collect information about them, and owners of site</span>s on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> when visiting them to warn people that such actions can be traced.
 The positive responsibilities of the state to guarantee respect for family life, protection from others, as well as to establish legal certainty in family relations and protect the secrecy of family life were analyzed.
 It is substantiated that the principle of inadmissibility of interference in family life is a principle enshrined in written law, which provides for respect for family life, prohibition of any illegal, arbitrary interference in family life, as well as protection of the secrecy of family life.</p>

<p>BackgroundSince 2014, many companies have followed the lead of Apple and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> and now offer financial support to female employees to access egg freezing. Australian companies may soon make similar offers. Employer-sponsored egg freezing (ESEF) has raised concerns and there is academic debate about whether ESEF promotes reproductive <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> or reinforces the ‘career vs.&nbsp;family’ dichotomy. Despite the growing availability of ESEF and significant academic debate, little is known about how ESEF is perceived by the public. The aim of this study was to explore women’s attitudes toward ESEF.MethodsWomen aged 18-60 years who resided in Victoria, Australia were invited to complete an online, cross-sectional survey investigating views toward egg freezing. Associations between participant demographics and their views about ESEF were assessed using multinominal logistic regression, adjusted for age and free text comments were analyzed using thematic analysis.ResultsThe survey was completed by 656 women, median age 28 years (range: 18-60 years). Opinions on the appropriateness of employers offering ESEF were divided (Appropriate: 278, 42%; Inappropriate: 177, 27%; Unsure: 201, 31%). There was significantly less support for ESEF among older participants and those employed part-time (p &lt; 0.05). While some participants saw the potential for ESEF to increase women’s reproductive and career options, others were concerned that ESEF could pressure women to delay childbearing and exacerbate existing inequities in access to ARTs.ConclusionsOur analysis revealed that while some women identified risks with ESEF, for many women ESEF is not viewed as theoretically wrong, but rather it may be acceptable under certain conditions; such as with protections around reproductive freedoms and assurances that ESEF is offered alongside other benefits that promote career building and family. We suggest that there may be a role for the State in ensuring that these conditions are met.</p>

<i> Asaf Harduf </i></p>
<p>Rape is the most severe sexual offense, involving one of the most feared and reviled acts a person can inflict on another. But what makes something rape? Initially, only penial-vagina forceful penetration; then, other forceful penial penetrations were added, oral and anal; and later the forceful insertion of inanimate objects as well. The requirement of using force lost its exclusiveness and much of its normative power, paving the way for other kinds of rape: sex by non-forceful coercion, sex by sedation, sex with incompetent victims, sex by fraud, and other forms of problematic sex. The normative debate about each form is ongoing, and in a manner of speaking, rape is a limitless idea. Where will the rape offense go next?</p>
<p><span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span>space, apparently. The Israeli Supreme Court has recently affirmed convictions of rape performed by distant words. The perpetrators conversed with children, teenagers and adult women online, using fraud and blackmail to manipulate them into masturbation and self-penetration. This groundbreaking judicial development is the inspiration to a normative analysis, revolving around Western notions of rape. Should such ill-intended communications constitute rape?</p>
<p>The article will normatively scrutinize the virtual rape thesis. It will analytically deconstruct the normative notion of rape into three facets, and examine each separately: the physics of the offensive scenario; the settings thereof, the manner in which sexual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is violated; and finally, the matter of proper criminal labeling. It will conclude that while sexual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is indeed under attack in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>space, the framework of rape is unsuitable to handle this form of offensiveness.</p>

<p>The aim of this study is to understand the changes within families during confinement motivated by the COVID-19 pandemic and to explore the psycho-emotional experiences of children and their parents in this new situation. Confinement necessarily induced significant changes in daily family routines, particularly for work, education, leisure and social activities. In the more vulnerable pediatric population, several authors have warned of the need to consider the impact of lockdown measures during COVID-19 on the psychological impact and well-being.This is an anonymous online survey with methodology combining quantitative and qualitative analyses. The questions targeted several themes such as life context, emotional experience and the impact on daily habits in children and adolescents, as perceived by parents. Participants are adults and parents of at least one child. They were recruited through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>.A total of 439 parents responded to the questionnaire. The families generally stayed in their usual place of residence and managed to adapt well. On average, the children’s level of worry (as estimated by parents) was lower than the level of worry parents attributed to themselves. For the majority, the parents did not observe any change, the psychological state of the children and adolescents was generally stable, but for those who experienced more negative emotions than usual, it was an increase in boredom, irritability and anger. A decrease in the quality of sleep was also observed by a third of the respondents. On the other hand, an increase in <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> was noted. Regarding the quality of family cohabitation, an important result showed that confinement had improved family relationships for 41% parents but at the expense of usual social ties inducing a feeling of deprivation. Indeed, the participants evoke a lack of “social link” and “social contact with friends”. Lack became synonymous with absence, a feeling of loneliness and separation.Our results confirm European and international data collected in children in countries where strict lockdown measures have been applied. Despite the negative emotions felt in some children, confinement has helped develop new resources in most families. Families seem to have been successful in maintaining a stable and secure routine which has certainly been a protective factor against anxiety. Some reported factors, such as bonding, could be protective factors and constitute good leads in interventions to be offered to children and their families.</p>

<p>Abstract The remarkable development of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICT), considering the rapidly aging global population, could eliminate the physical and mental burdens involved in caregiving and enhance the perceived dignity and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of older adults. However, the introduction of ICT in long-term care (LTC) in Japan has not yielded good results yet, and the social acceptance of ICT remains understudied. This study aimed to understand and examine people’s views on ICT use in LTC settings. An online vignette survey was conducted in August 2020, among community-dwelling persons between the ages of 40–89 years, throughout Japan. A set of four vignettes of different physical and cognitive functional situations, at either a home or nursing home, with or without ICT use, was presented to select a preferred care setting. Multinomial regression analyses were used to examine the relationships between participants’ choices and individual characteristics. A total of 4,457 participants (52.8% of whom were women) were analyzed (mean age = 60.8 years). Participants were more likely to choose nursing homes in cognitively dependent situations. Participants who were women, relatively younger, and had higher education were more likely to choose care settings employing ICT for physically and cognitively dependent situations. Those who experienced either informal or formal caregiving were more likely to choose care settings that used ICT. This study revealed that individuals preferred different levels of ICT use based on physical and cognitive situations. Barriers to introducing ICT in LTC settings will be discussed.</p>

<p>Abstract For sub-Saharan women enrolled in a protocol for assisted reproductive technology (ART), the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s entails dual allegiance: toward the services of reproductive medicine and toward their transnational family. Indispensable for medically monitoring women’s reproductive bodies, the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> enters the process for producing female gametes and contributes to the gender asymmetry typical of biomedicalized procreation. It is also used to maintain contacts with transnational family members who, from a distance, obtrude in the woman’s reproductive life. The use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s extends biomedical power over the woman’s body into her everyday life and the normative power of her transnational family into reproduction. Paradoxically, the mobile telephone allows collateral relatives to support the woman seeking reproduction assistance while also “hypermedicalizing” the woman’s daily life. Also paradoxically, this everyday companion is conductive to individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> while also being used for new forms of surveillance and control. The data come from fieldwork conducted in the greater Paris area between 2011 and 2013 within a network of ART professionals and their patients.</p>

<p>The pandemic that occurred this year created conditions that changed the activities of parents and children, the role of parents working outside the home often led to a lack of parental involvement in child development, especially the development of independence. The conditions of the Covid-19 pandemic have caused parents and children to be in one place at the same time. This study aims to determine the effect of parental involvement and maternal employment status on the independence of children aged 7-8 years in the Covid-19 pandemic situation. This quantitative research uses a comparative causal ex-post facto design, with groups of working mothers and groups of non-working mothers. The sample of each group was 60 people who were randomly selected. The findings of the study with the calculation of the two-way ANOVA test obtained the value of Fo = 4.616&gt; F table = 3.92 or with p-value = 0.034 &lt;α = 0.05, indicating that there is an interaction between parental involvement and maternal employment status on children’s independence, and Based on the results of hypothesis testing, there is no effect of parental involvement and mother’s work status on the independence of the child even though there are differences in the average results of children’s independence.

Specifically, emerging adults’ communication patterns and the relationships among communication, well-being, and their perceptions of parents’ involvement and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support are explored. Emerging adults ( N = 328) reported their frequency of communication in person, over the phone, via text message, and on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s with mother, father, and closest friend. A Latent Profile Analysis revealed four communication patterns (Low communication, Friend-oriented, Parent-oriented, and Multimedia). Communication patterns with mothers and fathers were similar; youth used more text messaging and social networking with friends. A Friend-oriented communication pattern was associated with psychological well-being while the Multimedia group reported higher social well-being.</p>

<p>Use of online health information is positively associated with citizen knowledge, empowerment, self-care, health outcomes, and quality of life. However, little is known about how mothers with incomes below the poverty threshold and with education levels of high school or less use and interact with the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> as a key source of lay knowledge and skills for infant care and childrearing. Our objective in this study was to understand mothers’ perceptions of their experience in using online information for these purposes. To obtain a rich and nuanced understanding of their experience, we used a qualitative study approach based on 40 individual semi-structured interviews with mothers. Adopting Freidson’s concept of “lay referral system” to grasp mothers’ experience with online parenting information, we found that they relied on this information source extensively. Our findings showed that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>-based information and online interactions were part of their lay referral system and modified to some extent how they interacted with their lay consultants (family and friends). Three major themes emerged in relation to how the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> functioned as a component of the mothers’ lay referral systems: (1) strategic use of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> for better parenting; (2) critical stance towards the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>; and (3) strengthening of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, skills, and self-confidence. Mothers with spouses and an active social network were more likely to use online information to complement information obtained from their entourage or from professionals than were mothers with a less active social network or who were more socially isolated.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) is being immersed in people’s daily lives at an increasingly younger age. It has been key for adolescents to pursue distance education, and their use and mastery of technological means and tools with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> access has increased. In this study, the motivation, specifically in the interest, digital competence, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and social interaction, generated by ICTs in the daily lives of adolescents during the pandemic caused by COVID-19 was analyzed. In the study, the objective was to study the motivation, use and commitment generated by ICTs in these students in relation to their gender and age after their confinement to the classroom caused by the first wave of incoming students. An experimental method of descriptive and correlative design was used along with a quantitative method to analyze the data. The data were obtained in the year 2020 through a validated questionnaire committed to the ICT scale used by PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment). A total of 924 students from the sixth grade of primary education in the autonomous city of Ceuta (Spain), aged between 10 and 13, participated in the sample. The results reveal that the motivation and commitment to ICT in these age groups were medium in relation to the total mean of results on a Likert-5 scale. Boys scored higher in all the variables analyzed, and both age and gender show correlations, in addition to the factor of prediction. In conclusion, students in the sixth year of primary education, after the confinement period, were medium-high in their use and engagement of ICT. In addition, gender and age affected ICT use and engagement.</p>

<p>Overparenting is a parental style that seems to be popular in all over the world. Specific parental characteristics and multi-cultural differences seemed to play an important role in this parental style to appear. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to identify the factors shaping overparenting and the impact in children, adolescents and young adults in Greece, comparing to European and Worldwide context. A literature review was conducted using online databases and words such as «overparenting», «helicopter parents», «intrusive parenting», «parental interference», and «parental control». Overparenting seems to be related to negative effects in children’s psychosocial and mental health. It was associated with lack of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, low levels of self-regulation and mastery, which affected social adjustment skills and higher levels of anxiety, depressive symptoms, poor self-regulation and low levels of life satisfaction in children. In Greece, overparenting was related to poor school adjustment, obesity, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> addiction and post-traumatic stress from bullying. Overparenting is becoming more and more popular, so more research is becoming a necessity. It is important for every state to support and consult parents, from pregnancy to school, with specialized programs and teachers’ training with the collaboration of social scientists. Further research of the phenomenon, in Greece and cross-culturally, is however needed.</p>

<p>Women’s economic and social empowerment is facilitated by their ability to move around independently and safely. However, in many developing countries women’s physical mobility is restricted by social norms, structural impediments related to poor quality of roads and transport systems, and security issues. Restrictions on female physical mobility and low levels of empowerment can also have negative implications for women’s access to healthcare services. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Mobile phone</span>s could help connect women to information and social networks and thus also strengthen their bargaining power within the household. Here, we use nationally representative data from 39,523 women in India collected in 2011-12 to analyse associations between women’s use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s and selected indicators of female <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and empowerment. Results indicate that women’s <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> use is positively associated with their physical mobility range and use of non-surgical contraceptives, whereas it is negatively associated with surgical contraceptive methods. We also analyse to what extent these associations are influenced by other socioeconomic and cultural factors. Our findings suggest that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s can play an important positive role for women’s empowerment in India.</p>

<p>The Autistic community values neurodiversity-positive approaches rather than behavioral interventions for Autistic children; however, little is known about what that would look like in occupational therapy. Frequently, researchers seek parent perspectives for understanding Autistic children’s preferences, while to date insufficient attention has been paid to Autistic adults as valuable informants on the Autistic experience of Autistic children. The objective of the study was to understand Autistic adult perspectives on pediatric occupational therapy for Autistic children. We sought and thematically analyzed data from a large <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> group and an occupational therapy podcast on Autistic values, needs, and experiences in pediatric occupational therapy. Participants described wanting therapy that supported Autistic identities rather than trying to “fix” children, changing environments or tasks to promote participation, and setting goals that address self-advocacy and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Occupational therapy practitioners should critically reflect on their practice’s alignment with Autistic values and start to shift their practice as needed.</p>
