<p>Project overview As a team explores interactions, they may find opportunities to expand and refine teamwork over time. This can have consequences for team effectiveness in normal and unexpected situations (Woods, 2018). Understanding the role of exploratory team interactions may be relevant for human-<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> team (HAT) resilience in the face of synthetic agent rigidity and lack of anticipation (Demir et al, 2019). Team interaction exploration was defined as team interactions with qualities (e.g.&nbsp;content, communication medium) unique to a team’s interaction history (Cooke et al., 2013; Hills et al., 2015). This study examines the relationship between team interaction exploration and HAT performance in multiple remotely-piloted aerial system (RPAS) reconnaissance missions with degraded conditions. The goal of the task was to take good photos of target waypoints. In this task, three teammates are assigned to specific roles: the navigator plans the route using a digital map, the pilot (synthetic) controls the RPAS and selects target waypoints, and the photographer calibrates camera settings to take a good photo of a target waypoint. The synthetic agent was capable of routine team coordination without explicit team player qualities. Teams communicated via a text-<span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> interface. Seven unique degraded conditions were injected throughout ten missions. Three automation failures disrupted RPAS status information on the photographer’s or pilot’s display, and three <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> failures disrupted the synthetic agent’s comprehension of waypoint information or caused the agent to move on to the next target before a photo was taken. Finally, a malicious <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-attack caused the synthetic agent to fly the RPAS to an enemy occupied waypoint. Method Forty-four participants were recruited from a large southwestern university in pairs and formed teams (22 teams) to participate in this study. These participants were either undergraduate or graduate students. This experiment consisted of ten 40-minute missions in total that were carried out over two sessions separated by one-to two-week intervals. After a baseline mission, an automation and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> failure was injected into each mission while the team processed target waypoints. The malicious <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-attack occurred during the final 20-minutes of the tenth mission. This study collected a several measures including measures of team process, physiological measures, and surveys of teamwork knowledge, trust, workload, and anthropomorphism which are not considered in this study. Exploratory team interaction was operationalized as any text-message unique in content, sender, or recipient that was unrelated to routine coordination of target waypoints. Teams were grouped using k-means clustering by their target processing efficiency, number of overcome roadblocks, and mission performance. The three clusters ( K = 3) were comparatively described as low- ( N = 7), middle- ( N = 7), and high-performing ( N = 5) teams. A mixed-factor ANOVA compared the frequency of each team’s exploratory interactions by mission and cluster. Results and discussion High-performing teams were distinguished from middle-and low-performing teams in their ability to maintain high levels of overall performance while efficiently processing targets and overcoming many roadblocks. Middle-performing teams were efficient in overcoming roadblocks but had worse mission performance. The findings indicate that 1) high-performing teams explored team interactions more than middle-performing teams, 2) there was no significant difference in exploration frequency between high-and low-performing teams, and 3) teams explored more in the first session than the second session, with the exception of the final mission. Overall, exploratory team interaction differentiated HAT performance in normal and degraded conditions and should be further examined at other levels of interaction, such as content meaning and interaction patterns.</p>

<p>Project Overview Team Situation Awareness (TSA), which is a part of team cognition, is a critical factor that influences team effectiveness. It can be defined as getting the right information from the right person within the right amount of time, in order to overcome an unexpected event (Gorman, Cooke, Pederson, Connor, &amp; DeJoode, 2005). TSA is developed and maintained through team interactions, allowing for the measurement of TSA based on team interaction (Cooke &amp; Gorman, 2009). In the current study, a specific measure, Coordinated Awareness of Situation by Teams (CAST) is used (Cooke &amp; Gorman, 2009). CAST evaluates the effectiveness and efficiency of team interaction under “roadblock” scenarios (Gorman, Cooke, &amp; Winner, 2006). These roadblocks represent novel situations in the task and require effective team communication and coordination. Team members must assess the situation according to their own specialized role and/or resources and coordinate with other team members to overcome each separate roadblock. In this task, effective communication refers to team anticipation. That is, each team member needs to anticipate each other’s needs by pushing information rather than pulling information during the task (Demir, McNeese, &amp; Cooke, 2017). In this study, we examined how pushing and pulling information, and CAST were associated with Team Situation Awareness (TSA) in both Human-<span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> (HAT) and all-human teams in simulated Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) task environment. In this research, we integrated the synthetic agent to the Cognitive Engineering Research on Team Tasks Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems - Synthetic Task Environment (CERTT-RPAS-STE) which was designed to be both a flexible research platform and a realistic task environment with a view to researching team performance and interaction-based measures of team cognition. In the simulated CERTT testbed, there are three heterogeneous teammates who need to take good photos of each target waypoint by communicating via text-<span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>: (1) the navigator who creates a dynamic flight plan and provides information about the waypoints, the RPA’s airspeed, and altitude restrictions to the pilot; (2) the pilot, who controls the RPA’s heading, altitude, and airspeed, and negotiates with the photographer in order to take a good photo; and (3) the photographer, who monitors sensor equipment in order to take photographs of target waypoints and sends feedback to the other team members about the quality of the photo. This project aimed to understand how team behaviors and team performance differed between HATs and all-human teams in RPAS operations: (1) the synthetic condition—the pilot role was given to the synthetic teammate, which was an ACT-R based cognitive model (which had a limited interaction ability, see Ball et al., 2010; Demir et al., 2015); (2) the control condition—the pilot was a randomly selected human participant, just like the other two participants; and (3) the experimenter condition—one of the experimenters served as an expert pilot. Experimenter condition utilized a Wizard of Oz paradigm in which a trained experimenter (located in a separate room) used a script to imitate a synthetic teammate and communicated with participants in limited communication behaviors but pushing and pulling information in a timely manner (robust coordination). Method There were 30 teams (10 for each condition): control teams consisted of three participants randomly assigned to each role; synthetic and experimenter teams included two participants randomly assigned to the navigator and photographer roles. The experiment took place over five 40-minute missions, and the goal was to take as many “good” photos of ground targets as possible while avoiding alarms and rule violations. During each mission, teams were presented with “roadblocks” by the introduction of a new, ad hoc target waypoint. We collected several measures, but we focused on: the proportion of roadblocks overcome per mission as an outcome measure of TSA; the CAST which is a coordination sequence of team interaction across the team members (i.e.&nbsp;which team members share with team members their experience during the roadblock); and verbal behaviors such as pushing and pulling information. Results and discussion In this team task, effective teamwork involves anticipating the needs of teammates, which in turn means pushing information before it is requested. However, in addition to anticipation, effective coordination is also needed during roadblocks. HATs demonstrated significantly lower levels of CAST than all-human teams. These results indicate that HATs’ lack of anticipation and coordination resulted in poorer TSA performance. These findings help HATs to grow its coordination and communication methodologies. Finally, future studies might examine the relationships highlighted in this study via nonlinear measures in terms of team stability and flexibility based on their communication and coordination patterns during the novel events. HAT is here to stay but improvements to human-machine interactions must continue if we are to improve team effectiveness.</p>

<p>Project overview Team resilience is an interactive and dynamic process that develops over time while a team maintains performance. This study aims to empirically investigate systems-level resilience in a Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) System simulated task environment by examining team interaction during novel events. The approach used in the current study to measure systems-level resilience was developed by Hoffman &amp; Hancock (2017). In their conceptual study, resilience was considered a key feature of success in emerging complex sociotechnical systems; in our case, that is applied to Human-<span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> Teams (HATs). Hoffman and Hancock conceptualized a resilience measure dynamically by means of several components, such as the time it took the system to recognize and characterize anomalies, and the time taken to specify and achieve new goals. In their framework, there were two main sub-events which expressed resilience via time-based measures, and upon which we designed ours in this study: (1) time taken to design a new process and (2) time required to implement it (Hoffman &amp; Hancock, 2017). Design In this current research, there were three heterogeneous team members who used a text-based system to communicate and successfully photograph target waypoints: (1) navigator – provided information regarding a flight plan with speed and altitude restrictions of each waypoint; (2) pilot – controlled the RPA by adjusting its altitude and airspeed through negotiating with the photographer in order to take a good photo of the target waypoints; and (3) photographer – screened camera settings and sent feedback to the other team members regarding the status of target’s photograph. This study followed the Wizard of Oz paradigm wherein the navigator and photographer were seated together in one room and were told that the pilot was a synthetic agent. In actuality, the pilot was a well-trained experimenter who was working from a separate room. This ‘synthetic’ pilot used restricted vocabulary to simulate that of a computer. The main manipulations in this study consisted of three degraded conditions: (1) automation failure - role-level display failures while processing specific targets, (2) <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> failure - autonomous agent behaved abnormally while processing specific targets (i.e., it provided misinformation to other team members or demonstrated incorrect actions), and (3) malicious <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-attacks - the hijacking of the synthetic agent, which led to the synthetic agent providing false, detrimental information to the team about the RPA destination. Because the malicious <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-attack only occurred once (during the final mission), we will focus on the automation and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> failures for this study. Each failure was imposed at a selected target waypoint and the teams had to find a solution in a limited amount of time. The time limit for each failure was related to the difficulty of the failure. Each failure was introduced at a pre-selected target waypoint for each team. Method In this experiment, there were 22 teams, with only two participants randomly assigned to the navigator and photographer roles for each team, because the pilot was a highly-trained experimenter. The current task was comprised of ten 40-minute missions in which teams needed to take as many “good” photos as possible of ground targets while avoiding alarms and rule violations. For this study, using the RPAS paradigm, we calculated two team resilience scores (1) time taken to design a new process and (2) time required to implement it (Hoffman &amp; Hancock, 2017). For the calculations, we used the message sent time (in seconds) for each role to express resilience in terms of the proportion of total task time (2400 seconds). As an outcome measure, we used target processing efficiency as a coordination and time-based performance score, which was based on how quickly teams were able to take a good photo of each target. Results and discussion We found that teams were more resilient during automation failures and progressed toward targets more successfully than during <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> failures. We see three possible explanations for this: (1) automation failures were more explicit than <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> failures, since at least one team member interacted with other teammates; (2) <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> failures took more time for human teammates to identify the failure, because the autonomous agent’s abnormal behavior was not as straight forward; and 3) human teammates overtrusted to the autonomous agent and lack confidence in themselves and let the failure go on.

<p>&lt;span&gt;Education in Mexico has not evolved in the way it is taught and evaluated. In the historical moment that postmodernism enters, it has not been possible to adapt to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=“IN”&gt; <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=“IN”&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ICT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=“IN”&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, or rapid technological innovation, or changes and trends in the industry, to the sharing economy or the rise of distance races. In its analysis, an essential deficiency is detected in the current education models, and it is detected that educational freedom is nil or scarce, which has led to poor student performance, high youth unemployment, which cause severe social problems and the economy of the economy. The current government is working closely with the private sector to connect education and promote employment. It is necessary to grant public schools more <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, freedom and responsibility. This paper explains how to act so that Mexico can adapt education 4.0 with solid steps to reach society 5.0.&lt;/span&gt;</p>

<p>As dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease is a major public health issue worldwide, there are many efforts at European level to promote active and healthy ageing. University of Pecs joined the ICT4Life project - supported by the European Union H2020 programme - in 2016. The aim of this three-years project is to improve qualityof- life and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of patients with mild or moderate dementia with developing a new <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>y (ICT) platform, which may provide help for patients, caregivers and professionals.The ICT4Life research is conducted among patients with cognitive decline, their relatives, caregivers, and professionals involved in their care. The needs of the different actors are assessed with semi-structured interviews and clinical scales (cognitive and affective scales, quality-of-life measurements, functionality, caregiver burden), which help to develop a user-friendly, adaptive and personalized platform.Using the integrated ICT platform (bio-sensors, smart TV, tablet, mobile, bracelet) may contribute to monitor (physical, psycho-motor and emotional states) elderly with cognitive decline and to provide better and personalized care for them. The platform includes cognitive enhancement with gamification, and focuses also on the decrease of professional and caregiver burden.Here we report on the ICT4Life programme, which develops an ICT solution for individuals with early stage cognitive impairment while contributing in a user-friendly way to extending their independence and improve their quality-of-life.</p>

<p>The possibility that mobile communication is able to extend human freedom is an intriguing prospect, and one that certainly seems confirmed by recent events. The possibility also raises fundamental questions about the use and consequences of mobile communication not only at the marco-political level but also at the micro-social interaction level. This paper examines selected topics related to the way in which mobile communication technology is used in microsettings, and that are broadly to the theme of personal freedom and individual responsibility. It begins by assessing the situation in the United States in terms of broad <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> adoption patterns. Highlights are then presented of several studies undertaken at Rutgers University’s Center for Mobile Communication Studies; these illuminate how issues of personal <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and social control are played out through mobile communication practices. Among the topics included are technology display rates in public places, pretend usages, and utilization by students (and professors) in educational settings. Also discussed are some unexpected consequences of mobile communication adoption for women from India. While these topics are diverse, they are linked thematically around personal actions in social settings and institutionally by their central concern to the Rutgers Center for Mobile Communication Studies. The author concludes by urging continued examination by scholars of the profound questions of human freedom and its advancement that are raised by the enormous and continuing success, as well as sporadic abuse, of mobile communication technology.</p>

<p>Abstract Facilitating a collaborative community in an online class takes a delicate balance of technology and personal communication. This article explores the use of asynchronous tools, including threaded discussions, announcements, and personal <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s to create and maintain a high-touch online classroom. The resulting course structure both increases student <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and enhances instructor efficacy. Introduction In fall 2003, I accepted a position that required me to adapt a core professional and technical writing course at the University of Wyoming (UW) to a virtual classroom. As an instructor for the only baccalaureate-degree-granting institution in Wyoming–a large, rural state with significant economic and educational diversity–I was used to serving a broad population with diverse learning styles and needs. Furthermore, I knew that although the technologies and processes in Web-based instruction provide flexibility for the distance learner, they also can produce specific challenges (DeTure 21). Nevertheless, I was unprepared for the glut of individual communications and the volume of personal attention my would require. Since then, I have developed the use of asynchronous tools to limit the repetitive, individual communications that overwhelmed me during my early semesters teaching online. Instead of relying on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> for mass communication, for example, I now use the course platform’s built-in Announcements tool. I also rely heavily on the materials posted on the course website and on students’ expertise with online learning in my responses to individual student inquiries. Finally, I continue building infrastructure into my course Home area. I have dubbed the resulting online course, which relies heavily on student-teacher and student-student communication, high-tech, high-touch. On the following pages, I discuss the development and application of these techniques. After a brief review of current literature and research into online teaching and learning, I contextualize my discussion by introducing course strategies and objectives. Next, I briefly overview the course platform, and finally, I discuss how I have used asynchronous tools, including threaded discussions, announcements, and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> both to facilitate community in the online classroom and to manage my teaching time more efficiently. Background In February 2004, the Conference on Composition and Communication (CCCC) issued a position statement identifying numerous best practices for faculty teaching writing and composition in the online environment. According to these guidelines, successful online instruction encourages contacts between student and faculty, develops reciprocity and cooperation among students, and uses active learning techniques (Yancey et al., par. 15). Indeed, as Cheng-Chang Pen and Michael Sullivan assert, communication is always a top priority in an online [teaching] environment (par. 1). In College Students’ Perceptions of Quality in Distance Education: The Importance of Communication, Madeline Ortiz-Rodriguez et al.&nbsp;affirm this assertion: Students related quality in with the following features: interaction between and instructors, and between and students; timely feedback from instructors; and availability and accessibility of teaching assistants, facilitators, professors, help staff, and technical staff (101). Communication in the online environment, however, is unlike the spontaneous that takes place in a physical classroom. Although course management systems (CMS) include synchronous tools, such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> rooms and white boards, as Alvin Wang and Michael Newlin explain, most Web-based courses rely primarily on asynchronous to deliver course information to students (par. 1). Furthermore, the very nature of online creates expectations of constant and immediate availability of faculty. …</p>

<p>The paper explores the issues and challenges of the affiliation system in Indian higher education system. India has the one of the largest system of higher education in the world with 33,023 institutes (UGC,2012) compared with 6,742 in the US and 4,297 in China(FICCI, E&amp;Y Report, 2011). However in terms of quality only one Indian university, IIT Bombay (317th rank) appear in top 400 universities of the world according to Times Higher Education 2012. Several committees and experts have argued that affiliation system needs to be reformed to reduce the burden on affiliating universities and improve quality. Reforming affiliation system requires an alternative which promotes <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, innovation, and better management. The paper concludes with recommendations for promoting clusters, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT), reducing political influence, autonomous colleges and streamlining regulatory framework.</p>

<p>Abstract. Digitalization, enhanced storage capacities, and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things increase the volume of data in modern organizations. To process and make use of these data and to avoid information overload, management information systems (MIS) are introduced that collect, process, and analyze relevant data. However, a precondition for the application of MIS is that users trust them. Extending accounts of trust in automation and trust in technology, we introduce a new model of trust in MIS that addresses the conceptual ambiguities of existing conceptualizations of trust and integrates initial empirical work in this field. In doing so, we differentiate between perceived trustworthiness of an MIS, experienced trust in an MIS, intentions to use an MIS, and actual use of an MIS. Moreover, we consider users’ perceived risks and contextual factors (e. g., <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> at work) as moderators. The introduced model offers guidelines for future research and initial suggestions to foster trust-based MIS use.</p>

<p>Teachers at all stages of their careers need to engage in lifelong learning to keep abreast with the changing and challenging pedagogical environment. The purpose of the study is to find out how informal learning helps experienced English teachers teaching non-English majors in a Chinese university to keep professional development in an age of web 2.0. A survey was conducted firstly to find out the status quo and the need of foreign language teachers’ professional development followed by in-depth interviews to elicit informal learning activities from three experienced English teachers. The study points to the changes in teachers’ informal learning activities in the new era of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and emerging technologies, characterized by the wide use of online learning resources, online learning communities and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s in addition to seeking help from colleagues.

<p>Abstract. Industry 4.0, based on increasingly progressive digitalization, is a global phenomenon that affects every part of our work. The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things (IoT) is pushing the process of automation, culminating in the total <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-physical systems. This process is accompanied by a massive amount of data, information, and new dimensions of flexibility. As the amount of available data increases, their specific timeliness decreases. Mastering Industry 4.0 requires humans to master the new dimensions of information and to adapt to relevant ongoing changes. Intentional forgetting can make a difference in this context, as it discards nonprevailing information and actions in favor of prevailing ones. Intentional forgetting is the basis of any adaptation to change, as it ensures that nonprevailing memory items are not retrieved while prevailing ones are retained. This study presents a novel experimental approach that was introduced in a learning factory (the Research and Application Center Industry 4.0) to investigate intentional forgetting as it applies to production routines. In the first experiment ( N = 18), in which the participants collectively performed 3046 routine related actions (t1 = 1402, t2 = 1644), the results showed that highly proceduralized actions were more difficult to forget than actions that were less well-learned. Additionally, we found that the quality of cues that trigger the execution of routine actions had no effect on the extent of intentional forgetting.</p>

<p>Fall detection for elderly and patient is a very important service that has the potential of increasing <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of elders while minimizing the risks of living alone. It has been an active research topic due to the fact that the health care industry has a big demand for products and technology of fall detection systems. Owing to the recent rapid advancement in sensing and wireless communication technologies, fall detection systems have become possible. They allow detecting fall events for the elderly, monitoring them, and consequently providing necessary help whenever needed. This paper describes the ongoing work of detecting falls in independent living senior apartments using force sensors and 3-axis accelerometers concealed under intelligent tiles. The force sensors permit detecting elders’ falls, locating, tracking and recognizing human activities (walking, standing, sitting, lying down, falling, and the transitions between them). However, the detection accuracy of real data contains false alarms coming from falling and lying postures. To solve this issue, we propose the fusion between the force sensor measurements and the accelerometer sensor decisions. As a consequence, the system accuracy is satisfactory and the results show that the proposed methods are efficient, and they can be easily used in a real elder tracking and fall detection system. The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>-of-Things (IoT) has taken the business spectrum, and its applications vary widely from agriculture and health care to transportation. A hospital atmosphere is terribly nerve-wracking, particularly for senior voters and youngsters. With the ever-increasing world population, the standard patient-doctor appointment has lost its effectiveness. Hence, good health care becomes vital. good health care is enforced the least bit levels, ranging from temperature observation for babies to pursuit very important signs within the senior. The complexness and value of implementation vary supported the specified preciseness of the individual devices, functionalities, and class of the appliance that they’re used.</p>

<p>This article highlights the dynamics of values in our reasoning on public space. By means of an epistemological study, illustrated by examples in the Dutch city of Amsterdam, it tests the contemporary premises underlying our ways to safeguard the inclusive, democratic, agential city, and, as such, it aims to update our view on public space. The article raises three subsequent questions: [i] Is the city our common house as perceived from the Renaissance onward, containing all, and consequently are public spaces used by the people as a whole? [ii] Is the city formalising our municipal <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> as emphasised since the Enlightenment, in an anti-egoistic manner, and in this line, are public spaces owned by local governments representing the people? And, [iii] is the city open to our general view as advocated in Modern reasoning, restricting entrepreneurial influences, and synchronically, are its public spaces seen and/or known by everyone? Inclusiveness, democracy, and ‘agentiality’ are strongholds in our scientific thinking on public space and each issue echoes through in an aim to keep cities connected and accessible, fair and vital, and open and social. Yet, conflicts appear between generally-accepted definitions and what we see in the city. Primarily based upon confronting philosophy with the Amsterdam case for this matter, the answering of questions generates remarks on this aim. Contemporary Western illuminations on pro-active citizens, participatory societies, and effects of, among others, global travel, migration, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and micro-blogging forecast a more differentiated image of public space and surmise to enforce diversification in our value framework in urban theory and praxis.</p>

<p>1 Introduction Currently, we are witnessing a resurgence of academic as well as political interest in the consumer. In view of the obvious problems of governance under conditions of a global market society, the question arises whether there is evidence for an emerging democracy where consumers assume civic responsibility and exert a civilizing influence upon the economic realm. Consumers are traditionally associated with the private sphere whereas are viewed as belonging to the public sphere. The figure of consumer challenges such a clear-cut distinction (Negt/Kluge [1972, 7] already questioned it long ago). Yet, at the same time, the hybrid notion of consumer perpetuates the distinction of public and private. Rather than rendering the distinction obsolete, it points to shifting boundaries and the lines of demarcation between public and private being redrawn as an outcome of continuous social struggles and negotiations. Benjamin Barber (2007, 126, also 294 ff.), who sees a threat to democracy in widespread infantilization spurred by industries, fears a dilution of the concept of citizen by lumping it together with the notion of consumer. (1) The political sphere, he claims, is experiencing a loss of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>–an <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> that emanates from public deliberation and the setting of collectively binding norms, the sovereignty of which must be asserted against the economic domain. For this reason, Barber wishes for self-confident of a democratic polity, whose individual mastery of life involves the ability of maintaining the differentiation of societal domains. Nonetheless, he too must take consumption as a facet of lifeworlds and life practices into account along with the problems it poses for civic involvement. We are at once consumers and and hence have no choice but to somehow reconcile the two sides that make up our personality–be it through strict separation or by other means. The conception of citizen serves to shed light on the forms such reconciliation may take–including the range of historical and empirical manifestations–not more and not less. (2) In this article, I approach the question of whether and how consumers as consumer citizens establish democracy by drawing on various theoretical building blocks from sociology. I will make use of the different dimensions contained in the notion of constitution, starting with the constitution of the social through action, through the politico-legal or institutional conditions constituting the citizen, to the current state of the citizen. Specifically, I will briefly discuss the citizen in five steps: from the angles of general social theory, socialization theory, the theory of modern society, from the view of current social trends, and in the light of considerations from the theory of democracy. The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, as a new means of networking, will serve as an empirical research area for exemplifying and specifying the theoretical considerations. 2 Social theory: the citizen as a form of constituting the subject in everyday practice At a first and general level of social theory, the question of how actors constitute the social will be addressed, which, as we all know, has been an object of considerable controversy in sociology. Approaching the issue from a theory of constitution (for instance Giddens 1984) implies that democracy cannot be conceived simply as a self-sustaining institutional order; rather actors, in this case citizens, must constantly produce and reproduce the structures of such an order. This said, we must first of all note that from the perspective of social theory consumption would be gravely misconceived as a passive, heteronomous activity. Rather consumption practices involve elements of active action, just as the domains of work and politics do, which are much more likely to be associated with exerting influence, exercising power, and with change. …</p>

<p>Abstract The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things (IoT) in healthcare sector is the collection of medical devices and applications that connect through online computer networks. The purpose of this study is to analyse the acceptance of medical devices that are based on IoT technology and monitor the health of individuals/patients. Most IoT medical initiatives have been focused on remote monitoring, improving patient care through various sensors and data processing those measures, for example, patients’ vital signs. In medical services trust plays a key role in the patients’ decision to adopt IoT technologies in medical industry. For this analysis, the Technology Acceptance Model was adopted in order to explain the way users accept and utilize these new medical devices that are based on IoT technology. The model was also used in order to identify those factors that influence the patients’ decision of accepting this technology and also analyse the way they use it. Cross-sectional data were collected from 96 patients through a survey. Data were then analysed by means of multiple regression analysis. The findings verified the research hypotheses. Thus, different securities challenges could face the adoption of the IoT. In addition, privacy requirements are another major challenge in using these technologies. Risks arise where devices and applications are untested, resulting in issues with interoperability, stability, compatibility and data security. For the elderly and people with disabilities, these IoT provisions are very useful in providing <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, a personalized approach and permanent monitoring. The theoretical contributions and practical implications of the study are discusses.</p>

<p>Staffing problems (including staff shortage) in nursing reveal the connection with the stereotypical perception of the profession. The study of stereotypes was limited to Moscow healthcare and was based on downloading messages from <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> (31,613 posts), the relevance of their study is determined by the growth of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> influence on public opinion. 24% of messages about nurses in the sample contain “large” stereotypical images (excluding spam). It was studied four “large” stereotypical images of a nurse: “guardian angel”, “doctor’s assistant”, “authoritarian nurse” and “sensual nurse”, and each one has negative aspects. Authors considered the specific perception of each of the images in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. The remaining 76% of messages do not offer an alternative image of a nurse. The conclusion offers recommendations aimed at increasing the prestige of the profession: creating a new positive image of the profession, promoting it, encouraging nurses to join public space and increasing their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.</p>

<p>Purpose The emergence of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> has provided an alternative mechanism for students to provide and access online reviews about universities. These forms of feedback are often not systematically monitored and interpreted by universities. The purpose of this paper is to analyse quantitative ratings and qualitative comments provided by students via Google reviews of 40 Australian universities. The qualitative comments were analysed via thematic coding which identified four key themes including quality of teaching, course design, learning environment and administrative support. The data were also subjected to automated content analysis using the text analytics software Leximancer to enhance the objectivity and reliability of findings. Design/methodology/approach The study involved the extraction of quantitative ratings as well as qualitative comments from Google reviews of 40 Australian universities. Each university was searched on Google and their rating and comments were collected as of August 2019. The qualitative data were included in an Excel spreadsheet along with the name of the universities, and their quantitative ratings. Using thematic coding techniques, the qualitative data were manually coded into four themes: quality of teaching, course design, learning environment and administrative support. Furthermore, the qualitative comments were grouped into two categories: positive comments and negative comments. Findings The paper argues the need for universities to actively monitor these new forms of student feedback which have provided <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and freedom for students and other stakeholders to access and provide 24/7 feedback. The study found common themes emerging from the positive and negative student comments related to: quality of teaching, course design, learning environments and administrative support. These aspects contributed to the students’ satisfaction levels when they reflected on their educational experience on Google reviews. The study also found that institutions with high numbers of negative comments tend to have lower ratings compared to those with positive comments. Research limitations/implications The study did not use other learning analytic tools to measure and assess the feedback from students using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and other forms of feedback. Originality/value Many studies have been undertaken on student experience. Studies have focussed on the experience of home and international students, on-campus and online students, and students from various underrepresented backgrounds. So far no study has been undertaken on the reviews provided by students using Google reviews.</p>

<p>With the introduction of more modern instructional practices, the traditional approach to learning and teaching is becoming ever more obsolete. Education practitioners all over the world have been calling for educational institutions, in both developed and developing countries, to improve pedagogical practices as a means of significantly enhancing learner experiences and outcomes in the learning-teaching process. There is evidence that rapid technological changes are taking place in the educational landscape and that the utilisation of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies in the instructional process is becoming more and more mandatory. Bearing in mind the afore-mentioned, the objective of this discussion is to underscore the place of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies in curriculum design and development. The focus of this discussion and review of literature is on curriculum and what it entails, the importance of curriculum, curriculum design and development, and ICTs and curriculum design and development (which looks at learning theories and ICT-based curricula, integration of ICTs into educational curricula, integration of ICTs into foreign language curricula, and the need for ICT-based curricula). Special consideration is given to ICT-based foreign language curricula because of the increasing importance of language didactics and foreign language education today. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies should be considered and integrated into educational curricula because they can revolutionise instructional practices and stimulate pedagogical innovation; foster learner engagement; cater for student learning diversity; promote learner independence and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>; increase learner interaction and communication, and support intellectual expressiveness and creativity of learners, application, and lifelong learning.</p>

<p>There is a move towards a future in which consumers of technology are untethered from the devices and technology use becomes subliminal. With this increasing device opacity, loss of user control and increasing device <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, there are calls for more research on users’ privacy and freedom of choice. There are, however, key figures in the creation of modern technologies who suggest that consumers are informed of the implications of the use of these technologies or, that consumers use the technologies willingly. This paper examines, using Critical Discourse Analysis, two genres of IT-related communication viz.&nbsp;a speech made by the CEO of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>, the largest social-networking site and, the privacy policy document of Truecaller, said to be the most-downloaded app in Africa. Furthermore, 25 Sub-Saharan African users were interviewed on their use and understanding of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s. The analysis reveals concerns of consumers regarding the absence of choice, a lack of knowledge and information privacy erosion are not unfounded. The results show also that with the speech and policy document alike, there was information that was distorted or omitted. The conclusion was that the discourses surrounding context-awareness, through confusion, misrepresentations, false assurances and illegitimacy, contribute to information imbalances and asymmetry but most importantly, an uninformed consumer.</p>

<p>Co-construction theory suggests adolescents use digital communication to address developmental challenges. For a sample of 214 ethnically diverse adolescents, this research used direct observation to investigate the frequency, content, and timing of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">texting</span> with parents, peers, and romantic partners through grades 9-12. Analyses showed that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">texting</span> frequency follows a curvilinear trajectory, peaking in eleventh grade. Adolescents discussed a range of topics, predominantly with peers. Communication with parents was less frequent, but consistent over time. Approximately 45-65% of adolescents communicated with romantic partners, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">texting</span> heavily and about topics similar to those discussed with peers. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Texting</span> may help adolescents navigate key developmental challenges of adolescence-the establishment of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, intimate peer relationships, romantic relationships, and self-identity.</p>

<p>Abstract This article explores the institutional logics of intrapreneurial units, or groups within organizations that are designated to foster organizational innovation. Drawing on interviews with news intrapreneurs developing <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots in news media organizations, this study shows that innovation can be stymied because of conflicting institutional logics. News intrapreneurs adopt a logic of experimentation, audience orientation, and efficiency-seeking, but that approach clashes with a journalistic logic prioritizing news workflows, formats, and associated <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for newsworkers. These clashing logics limit the adoption and influence of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots. This study illustrates the shaping influence of competing institutional logics and their negotiation in the development, deployment, and success or failure of intrapreneurial activities within organizations. The lesson is not that the existence of competing logics is, by default, a defeating proposition for innovation. Rather, this study advances scholarly understanding of the role of institutional logics in frustrating or facilitating technological adoption in organizations.</p>

<p>This Article introduces the ongoing progression of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things (IoT) into the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Bodies (IoB)—a network of human bodies whose integrity and functionality rely at least in part on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and related technologies, such as artificial intelligence. IoB devices will evidence the same categories of legacy security flaws that have plagued IoT devices. However, unlike most IoT, IoB technologies will directly, physically harm human bodies—a set of harms courts, legislators, and regulators will deem worthy of legal redress. As such, IoB will herald the arrival of (some forms of) corporate software liability and a new legal and policy battle over the integrity of the human body and mind. Framing this integrity battle in light of current regulatory approaches, this Article offers a set of specific innovation-sensitive proposals to bolster corporate conduct safeguards through regulatory agency action, contract, tort, intellectual property, and secured transactions/bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Yet, the challenges of IoB are not purely legal in nature. The social integration of IoB will also not be seamless. As bits and bodies meld and as human flesh becomes permanently entwined with hardware, software, and algorithms, IoB will test our norms and values as a society. In particular, it will challenge notions of human <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and self-governance. Legal scholars have traditionally considered Kantian <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> as the paradigmatic lens for legal determinations impacting the human body. However, IoB threatens to undermine a fundamental precondition of Kantian <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>—Kantian he<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Damaged he<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> renders both Kantian <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and deliberative democracy potentially compromised. As such, this Article argues that safeguarding he<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> should constitute the animating legal principle for governance of IoB bodies. The Article concludes by introducing the companion essay to this Article, The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Latour’s Things. This companion essay inspired by the work of Bruno Latour offers a sliding scale of “technohumanity” as a framework for the legal and policy discussion of what it means to be “human” in an age where bodies are the “things” connected to the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>.</p>

<p>Over ten years ago, two community media initiatives were founded by young people in their early twenties in Bogota, Colombia and Quito, Ecuador. While the Colombia-based collective, Ojo al Sancocho, has struggled to build bridges among urban and migratory communities uprooted by an entrenched, decades-old armed conflict, the Ecuadorian group, El Churo Comunicacin, has fostered audiovisual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and resistance among indigenous, feminist and ecological social movements that have had to defend their rights even though they were supposedly guaranteed by a so-called progressive government. Despite formidable challenges, each has fulfilled a long-held dream - a community movie theater, and the expansion of a radio-based practice to a multiplicity of practices that include community filmmaking, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>feminism and capacity-building of communities across Ecuador and Latin America. Together with other collectives, Ojo al Sancocho and El Churo are building a network of community filmmakers across Latin America. Using each organizations 2017 annual gathering as a point of departure, and subsequent meetings in 2018-2019, this article analyzes the characteristics that have led to innovation and sustainability in diverse contexts. It also indicates key challenges they face. This is an engaged, ethnographically-based, scholarly work.</p>

<p>Abstract The debate about the ethical implications of Artificial Intelligence dates from the 1960s (Samuel in Science, 132(3429):741–742, 1960. 10.1126/science.132.3429.741 ; Wiener in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span>netics: or control and communication in the animal and the machine, MIT Press, New York, 1961). However, in recent years symbolic AI has been complemented and sometimes replaced by (Deep) Neural Networks and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. This has vastly increased its potential utility and impact on society, with the consequence that the ethical debate has gone mainstream. Such a debate has primarily focused on principles—the ‘what’ of AI ethics (beneficence, non-maleficence, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, justice and explicability)—rather than on practices, the ‘how.’ Awareness of the potential issues is increasing at a fast rate, but the AI community’s ability to take action to mitigate the associated risks is still at its infancy. Our intention in presenting this research is to contribute to closing the gap between principles and practices by constructing a typology that may help practically-minded developers apply ethics at each stage of the Machine Learning development pipeline, and to signal to researchers where further work is needed. The focus is exclusively on Machine Learning, but it is hoped that the results of this research may be easily applicable to other branches of AI. The article outlines the research method for creating this typology, the initial findings, and provides a summary of future research needs.</p>

<p>The article is devoted to the theoretical substantiation of the podcasting as the most up-to-date interactive and communicative technology for learning English, determining the essential characteristics and selection criteria from the perspective of teaching a foreign language. It is determined that the podcast is a meaningfully completed and informationally self-sufficient audio file that reflects the characteristics of speech, consciousness and thinking of speakers of a particular language and sociocultural traditions. Due to the analysis of various classifications of podcasts, some scientists have established that there is no generally accepted classification. The complexity of their classification lies in the fact that there are many criterias by which we can classify podcasts in accordance with: 1) the purpose of use; 2) the level of language training of the target audience; 3) the study of individual sections of linguistics; 4) topics; 5) genres. It is proved that the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> technology of podcasting is based on the basics of technical and didactic characteristics: authenticity, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (distance), relevance, formation of competence in the field of media and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> technologies, interactivity, performance and use of a mobile technical device outside the school. The key point in the selection of podcasts is the definition and justification of the relevant linguistic criteria (phonetic, lexical and grammatical).</p>

<p>Working from the perspective of open and online learning for widening participation in higher education, this article advances a new conceptual model to guide practitioners and researchers in maximising the enablers and minimising the constraints to foundation level online learning for equity students. The model is adapted from technology for social inclusion research addressing persistent inequalities in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use. First, the proposed model is introduced with definitions for the six dimensions (course purpose, technology, social support, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, learning materials and skills) and research propositions for how the dimensions enable and constrain learning. A qualitative synthesis of empirically tested open and online programs (including massive open online courses) is used to clarify how the six critical dimensions interact to enable and constrain diverse learners in distance and blended modes. Results support the model with new definitions for each dimension in light of unexpected findings: courses designed to enable particular groups; breadth of learner supports; technology amplifying other dimensions; and aspects of the model designed to empower disadvantaged learners. This model should assist course design research and practice at higher education institutions where open and online provision for diverse and educationally disadvantaged learners is the current or approaching reality.</p>

<p>The aim of the article is to present an analysis of the assessment of the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) in conventional textbooks for teaching English. After presenting the theoretical framework of the new core curriculum in terms of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and ICT application, the study describes the way in which ICT tools are integrated or ignored in current English textbooks. The study covered textbooks used in the seventh grade of primary school. Six of the eight (one per publisher) textbooks available on the market were selected for this purpose. Qualitative research comprised a thorough evaluation of tasks which comprised explicit references to ICT. The quality of the analysed didactic materials was determined by the potential level of supporting students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> by using the coursebook tasks in question, measured through a specially designed Likert scale. The conclusions served to propose changes and improvements to these textbooks.</p>

<p>A good person-environment-fit has positive effects on well-being in old age. As digital technologies are an integral part of older adults’ environments, we predicted that the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICT) is associated with subjective well-being among the oldest-old. Specifically, we compared different user groups of ICT devices (nonusers, users of nonweb-connected ICT, users of web-connected ICT) and analyzed the relations among ICT use and three domains of subjective well-being (loneliness, anomie, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>).We performed a quantitative data analysis using data from the first representative state-wide survey study in North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany on quality of life and well-being of the oldest-old (n = 1,698; age range: 80-103; 9% long-term care). Multiple regression analyses were applied.The findings revealed that 25.9% of all individuals aged 80 years and older reported using web-connected ICT, in contrast to 38.5% who do not use ICT at all. Individuals who used web-connected ICT reported lower levels of loneliness and anomie, and higher levels of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. These differences remain significant when controlling for indicators of social inclusion and individual characteristics.This study investigated an underexplored group in terms of ICT use, shedding light on the relationship between ICT use and subjective well-being. The oldest-old generally use ICT in their everyday life but an age-related digital divide still exists. To avoid negative consequences of nonuse digital infrastructures and technology training for older adults need to be established.</p>

<p>The technological characteristics of today’s society have favored the inclusion of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) and the emergence of new training methodologies in educational spaces. This study addresses flipped learning as an innovative approach in the teaching and learning processes of physical education at two educational stages, primary and secondary education. The objective of this study is to analyze the effectiveness of flipped learning with respect to traditional methodology. A descriptive and correlational experimental research design was used through a quantitative perspective. Two study groups were established, one control (traditional methodology) and one experimental (flipped learning) in each educational stage. A total of 119 students from an educational center in Ceuta (Spain) participated. These participants were chosen intentionally. The data were collected through a questionnaire. The results show that the experimental group obtained better evaluations in the academic indicators, highlighting the motivation, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and interactions between the different agents. Regarding the effectiveness of flipped learning according to the educational stage, its potential was demonstrated in both stages, highlighting a significant improvement in <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in secondary education.</p>

<p>Rape is the most severe sexual offense, involving one of the most feared and reviled acts a person can inflict on another. But what makes something rape? Initially, only penial-vagina forceful penetration; then, other forceful penial penetrations were added, oral and anal; and later the forceful insertion of inanimate objects as well. The requirement of using force lost its exclusiveness and much of its normative power, paving the way for other kinds of rape: sex by non-forceful coercion, sex by sedation, sex with incompetent victims, sex by fraud, and other forms of problematic sex. The normative debate about each form is ongoing, and in a manner of speaking, rape is a limitless idea. Where will the rape offense go next?</p>
<p><span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span>space, apparently. The Israeli Supreme Court has recently affirmed convictions of rape performed by distant words. The perpetrators conversed with children, teenagers and adult women online, using fraud and blackmail to manipulate them into masturbation and self-penetration. This groundbreaking judicial development is the inspiration to a normative analysis, revolving around Western notions of rape. Should such ill-intended communications constitute rape?</p>
<p>The article will normatively scrutinize the virtual rape thesis. It will analytically deconstruct the normative notion of rape into three facets, and examine each separately: the physics of the offensive scenario; the settings thereof, the manner in which sexual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is violated; and finally, the matter of proper criminal labeling. It will conclude that while sexual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is indeed under attack in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>space, the framework of rape is unsuitable to handle this form of offensiveness.</p>

<p>The main purpose of this review is to present why and how <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> can be applied in language teaching and learning, as seen from the point of view of practitioners. Vygotskian constructionism has provided the theoretical framework for the investigation. The wide availability of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and their high penetration rate are seen as key advantages. The stress has been put on the fact that such platforms enable users to interact with others and acquire the target language in their own community of practice. The learning process, thus, gets enriched by both individual and collaborative dimensions. Negotiation of meaning, as well as the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in creating one’s new identity and customizing the study content, become crucial aspects of the experience. Assuming accountability for one’s own learning results in increased intrinsic motivation to bridge the gap between the current level of knowledge and the desired proficiency level. Finally, certain features of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> that allow instructors to use them in class are discussed.</p>

<p>This article aims at analyzing the discourse involved in the city council program called “Recife, city of the people”, from Foucault’s archeology of knowledge perspective. The corpus of this research consists of six videos available on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>® page of the city council of Recife in 2014, when government agency released the slogan “Recife, Cidade das Pessoas”. The study is justified by the need of understanding how the political discourses are spread and how these discourses have no explicit assumptions. We believe that a better design of the influence of discourses, along with further clarification of social significance exercised by them, can contribute to a more democratic social life, which will be accessible to the entire population. For the present study, no theory was previously defined. The option for this construction enables the non-interference of external factors guiding the analyses. Data was analyzed without theoretical influences, so that the theoretical constructs emerged from the analysis rather than the reverse. However, the vision of authorship in relation to the concept of speech interferes with the analysis and serves as a theoretical lens through which data will be displayed. For results, two discursive formations were found: (1) the protection of the Government and (2) healthy lifestyles practices, with includes social, cultural and physical. This discursive formation is founded on the pillars of bio-politics and sustainability, quality of life and social change. It was noticed that the program has a goal it is to influence people’s opinions about public spaces and mobility in a municipality.</p>

<p>Abstract On long-duration space missions, skill retention and generalizability become ever more important as mission length increases, for it is through these capabilities that astronaut crews achieve <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Because simulators are used extensively in all types of training, the effects of simulator fidelity on skill retention and generalizability are paramount to understand. A literature survey was performed to identify current research gaps in skill retention and generalizability. The survey identified a need for a structured and quantifiable approach to characterize skill decay, for example, using a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netic approach. Such an approach would allow for gaining a deeper understanding of the mechanisms through which skill decay operates. Furthermore, the literature survey identified three research gaps and opportunities for future research: (1) developing skill decay functions provides theoretical insights into skill decay and could allow for several practical applications, such as planning refresher training, (2) investigating the effects of simulator fidelity on skill decay functions could allow for better simulator utilization during training, and (3) investigating the generalizability of skills learned in initial training to other tasks could provide space crews with greater <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.</p>

<p>The article is based on the materials of foreign sources and discusses the current trends in the relationship of adolescents and their parents. The following problems are discussed: influence of upbringing styles and parental attitudes on various aspects of psychological development of adolescents; contribution of relationships with parents and peers into social and personality development in adolescence; peculiarities of teenagers’ attachments to parents; child-parent conflicts. The recent studies of family education and its influence on psychological development confirm the positive role of authoritative parenting style, the negative impact of rigid parenting style on adolescent aggression and so on. It is shown that excessive parental control does not contribute to the development of self-esteem and increases self-criticism in adolescent girls. In relatively new researches devoted to “technoference” the negative impact of technical means (phone, gadgets) on interaction between parents and children is shown. The article stresses the importance of attachment to parents in adolescence; the role of the quality of attachment in formation of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>; capacity to solve problems and cope with difficulties associated with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction; aggression and school performance. The article also presents studies of positive and negative aspects of the impact of conflict with parents on the personality development of adolescents, gender differences in behavior during the conflict between mother and father, the contribution of marital conflicts to psychological development in adolescence.</p>

<p>BookTubers (from the acronym book + YouTuber) have become key players for the publishing industry, given their influence on children and teens to promote reading and book consumption. Based on an 18-month digital ethnography that combines direct observation, digital interactions on YouTube channels, and other <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and semistructured interviews with 17 Spanish-speaking BookTubers, this study uses Pierre Bourdieu’s concepts of field and capital to analyze how BookTubers negotiate their practices with other agents of the publishing world. This article characterizes the challenges the Spanish-language publishing industry is facing in the context of digitalization to attract readers; describes the position that BookTubers have within the YouTube ecosystem, and how they relate with the platform’s actors, politics, and affordances; and analyzes the exchanges that BookTubers establish with publishers—often referred as collaborations—and their implications for their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. This case study helps to understand how platformization allows new agents to transfer capital gained in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> to other cultural industries.</p>

<p>Customer-owned touch points have emerged as a central context for customers to consume, contribute, and create content while interacting with one another on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. Research on how firms’ attempts to intervene in such forums affect customers’ experience supremacy is still in its infancy. This study attempts to address this limitation, suggesting a framework for understanding firms’ impact on customer experience in customer-owned forums. Towards this aim, we adopt self-determination theory as a theoretical lens, and, empirically draw on interview material gleaned from customer-owned touch point users. The results show that companies’ attempt to control the discussions in such forums may have a negative impact on customers’ experiences when it undermines their sense of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, relatedness, and competence. However, firms’ intervention is welcome when the intention is to add value, enabling customers to retain or enhance their feeling of self-efficacy and social esteem.</p>

<p>Over the past decade, the issue of uncontrolled growth of unsystematic information in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> has remained acute for the scientific community. The problem of finding relevant information related to the distribution and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of scientific information resources remains. A priority in the field of centralized access to the key scientifically significant sources of information is the creation of a united information space (UIS). The study aims to identify the main models to form systems integrating distributed information resources, and as a result to determine the structure of UIS formation in a research library. Two models were considered and analyzed in the study: a meta-aggregator and an integrated electronic library. During the analysis, elements, structure and a set of functions for users and employees of a research library are revealed for each model. The study allowed the drawing of the following conclusions: • The choice of a model for the UIS formation depends mostly on the formulation of tasks, the solution of which is the purpose of creating a system, as well as on the technological potential of the organizations involved in the process. •Multifunctionality of the system allows simultaneous use of the above-mentioned formation models. • Adding the element of interactivity to the structure of UIS of the research library will allow timely monitoring of changes in the information needs of scientists, reduction of time, labor and financial costs of both the library and a user. The article presents the criteria for choosing a model. For the first time the optimal effective structure of the UIS in the research library is described.</p>

<p>Instances of anxiety, depression, and loneliness are attaining epidemic-levels among college-age students. Self-determination theory suggests that such feelings are attributable to antagonistic situations hindering the satisfaction of an individual’s basic needs for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness. Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) is a phenomenon that arose in the context of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use and refers to the need to stay continually connected. Studies have shown that problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and mobile technology use are related to feelings of anxiety, depression, and loneliness, and FOMO. Few studies have examined the relationships between these factors and academic performance. This study examines how Loneliness, FOMO, and the basic needs <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span>, Competence, and Relatedness, are related to Academic Performance. We find a positive influence of FOMO and a negative influence of <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> on Academic Performance. We discuss these and other findings.</p>

<p>• Public health authorities can mitigate community resistance to aerial spraying. • Zika-affected persons favor <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, transparency, reasonableness, and solidarity. • Proliferating <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and skepticism toward government present challenges. Aerial spraying of products to kill larvae or adult mosquitoes is a public health measure used to control vector-borne diseases. In some outbreaks, the intervention has evoked controversy and community resistance. This study evaluated how local opinion leaders in US localities affected by Zika think about community engagement in public health policies for outbreak response. In December 2017 through March 2018, 4 focus groups were convened in Houston, TX, New Orleans, LA, Miami, FL, and Brooklyn, NY. They discussed a hypothetical scenario that featured vector control by aerial spraying. Participants (N = 20) more readily accepted this vector control method under 4 conditions: They were informed of alternatives, benefits, and risks for human health and the environment. Public health claims were backed by objective evidence and an authority figure genuinely working in the community’s interests. They received timely notice about how to mitigate toxin exposure. And, aerial spraying helped to protect vulnerable individuals. The community engagement requirements of the local opinion leaders resonate with core principles of recent public health ethics frameworks: namely, personal <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, transparency, reasonableness, and solidarity. Participants foresaw problems with community consent in an era of growing <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use and mistrust in governmental and scientific authority. They also debated whether health authorities should use moral-based arguments, in addition to science-based ones, to communicate aerial spraying’s risks and benefits.</p>

<p>As a result of several years of European funding, progressive introduction of assistive technologies in our society has provided many researchers and companies with opportunities to develop new <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies aimed at overcoming the digital divide of those at a greater risk of being left behind, as can be the case with healthy older people and those developing cognitive decline and dementia. Moreover, in recent years, when considering how <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies have been integrated into older people’s lives, and how technology has influenced these individuals, doubts remain regarding whether technologies really fulfil older users’ needs and wishes and whether technologies developed specifically for older users necessarily protect and consider main ethical values. In this article, we address the relevance of privacy, vulnerability and preservation of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> as key factors when involving older individuals as target users for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y research and development.

<p>Background: Behavioral addiction (BA) is a recent concept in psychiatry. Few studies have investigated the relationship between BA and early maladaptive schemas (EMSs). EMS is the core of Schema Therapy (ST). According to the ST model, psychiatric disorders result from the developmentof EMSs in response to unmet emotional needs in childhood. Bach and colleagues (2018) grouped the 18 EMSs in four domains: 1) disconnection and rejection; 2) impaired <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and performance; 3) excessive responsibility and standards; and 4) impaired limits. This study aims at assessing the possible association of the most frequent BAs with EMSs in a large group of late adolescents and young adults and to evaluate their self-perceived quality of life. Methods: A battery of psychological tests assessing food addiction (FA), gambling disorder (GD), <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> addiction (IA) and quality of life (QoL) was administered to 1,075 late adolescents and young adults (N=637; 59.3% women). A forward-stepwise logistic regression model was run to identify which variables were associated with behavioral addictions. Results: FA was more frequent among women and GD among men, while IA was equally distributed. Regarding the EMSs, participants with FA or IA showed significantly higher scores on all four-schema domains, whereas those with GD exhibited higher scores on impaired <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and performance and impaired limits. Besides, average scores of all domains increased with the association of 2 or more comorbid BAs. Self-perceived QoL was lower for participants with FA and IA, but not for those with GD; the presence of comorbid BAs was associated to lower PCS and MCS scores. Finally, specific EMS domains and demographic variables were associated with each BA. Conclusions: Late adolescents and young adults with FA or IA have a lower perception of their mental and physical health. The most striking result is that FA appears to be associated with the disconnection and rejection schema domain, IA with all the schema domains (except for impaired <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and performance), and GD with impaired <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and performance schema domain. In conclusion, our findings suggest that EMS should be systematically assessed during psychotherapy of patients with BAs.</p>

<p>This essay maps IBM’s attempts to construct a typology of high-tech ‘New Collar’ work and leverage policymaking outcomes to underwrite IBM corporate ventures capable of materializing this work. Through a discursive analysis of IBM corporate texts, webpages, and the 2017 New Collar Jobs Act, I argue for New Collar work to be understood through the lens of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, as IBM recasts notions of ‘autonomous’ technology onto humans by downplaying dystopic associations of technological <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and transferring notions of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to human workers. In doing so, I account for IBM’s use of ‘augmentation’ to situate human intelligence as the cognitive force uplifted by work performed with artificial intelligence. By pairing human augmentation with posthumanist conceptions of ‘distributed cognition’, IBM centers human intelligence through a redistributed cognition that reverses posthumanism’s decentering of human supremacy. Following from this, I unpack ‘New Collar’ as a reinvention of ‘white’ and ‘blue’ collar dichotomies and New Collar work as the grounds for tech workers to reinvent themselves. In this way, by minimizing the necessity of 4-year college degrees as pathways to economic and professional mobility, IBM constructs ‘New Collar’ with embedded notions of enlarged self-determination for applied worker intellect, vocational training, and employability. Under the aegis of creating, training, and employing New Collar workers, IBM pursues policy outcomes to underwrite corporate ventures related to New Collar work and bolster its institutional <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> amidst marketplaces of cognitive capitalism. By outlining how tax relief provisions of the New Collar Jobs Act correlate with neoliberal ideologies of legislators and IBM investments in public–private vocational models and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security platforms, I account for IBM’s elongated ‘economy of learning’ that enables the company to more thoroughly capture, underwrite, and commodify New Collar cognition from training to market outputs.</p>

<p>The Interaction of Person-Affect-Cognition-Execution model (I-PACE; Brand, Young, Laier, Wolfling, &amp; Potenza, 2016) proposes that addictive behavior is the result of the interaction of multiple factors. According to I-PACE model, perceived social support (teacher <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support), self-esteem, and gratification (life satisfaction) contribute to adolescent <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use disorder (SUD) (Brand et al., 2016). However, previous studies have rarely examined the interactive effects of teacher <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support, self-esteem and life satisfaction on adolescent SUD. The present study examined these relationships using a moderated mediation model in which self-esteem played a mediating role and life satisfaction played a moderating role in the relation between teacher <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support and adolescent SUD. A sample of 1912 Chinese adolescents completed measures of teacher <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support, self-esteem, life satisfaction, and adolescent SUD. Self-esteem mediated the association between teacher <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support and adolescent SUD. In addition, the relation between teacher <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support and SUD was moderated by life satisfaction: when the effect of life satisfaction was high, teacher <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support negatively predicted adolescent SUD, whereas when the effect of life satisfaction was low, teacher <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support was positively related to adolescent SUD. These findings advance our understanding of the effect of teacher <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support, self-esteem and life satisfaction on adolescent SUD. Limitations and implications of this study are discussed, such as teacher <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support may not reduce adolescent SUD, especially when their life satisfaction is low.</p>

<p>The “Taylorian” management thinking of the outside control in the past has been unable to adapt to the current <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> era. The external control has changed to the flexible management of self-control, and the increase of job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> has become a trend. Job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> refers to the discretion of an organization to allow employees to complete tasks when, where, in what order and in what manner. In the past, the mainstream theoretical models and empirical studies have found that the job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> has a positive impact on employees. But currently the new research has found that the excessive job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> can have a negative impact on employees, and there is a “too-much-of-a-good-thing” effect. This article mainly expounds the “too-much-of-a-good-thing” effect of the job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and then, explains the effect by the two types mechanisms, “additive benefit and cost” and “interactive motivation and opportunity”. Finally, this article puts forward some issues that should be paid attention to future researches.</p>

<p>English speaking proficiency requires more than knowing its grammatical and semantic rules. It also includes the knowledge of how native speakers of one language use the language in the context of structures of interpersonal exchange in which many factors interact. In this study, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> was implemented by journal or diary writing, sharing and discussing journals, sharing feedback on journals, reflection, promoting dictionary use, introducing useful <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> websites, forming yahoo groups, sharing valuable links, creating online self-access center, watching preferable movies, and goal setting. The present quasi-experimental study aimed to investigate the impact of teaching <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> on the speaking skill of Iranian EFL learners. To this end, 44 male and female intermediate students at Respina Talk (i.e., Iran-Canada) language school with the age range of 20-35 were selected in order to achieve the objectives of the study. According to the obtained results, there was a significant relationship between teaching <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and EFL learners’ speaking skill. The findings of this study may have some theoretical and practical implications for material developers, EFL teachers, language learners, etc.</p>

<p>Abstract Previous research on the relationship between students’ home and school <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>y (ICT) resources and academic performance has shown ambiguous results. The availability of ICT resources at school has been found to be unrelated or negatively related to academic performance, whereas the availability of ICT resources at home has been found to be both positively and negatively related to academic performance. In addition, the frequency of use of ICT is related to students’ academic achievement. This relationship has been found to be negative for ICT use at school, however, for ICT use at home the literature on the relationship with academic performance is again ambiguous. In addition to ICT availability and ICT use, students’ attitudes towards ICT have also been found to play a role in student performance. In the present study, we examine how availability of ICT resources, students’ use of those resources (at school, outside school for schoolwork, outside school for leisure), and students’ attitudes toward ICT (interest in ICT, perceived ICT competence, perceived ICT <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>) relate to individual differences in performance on a digital assessment of reading in one comprehensive model using the Dutch PISA 2015 sample of 5183 15-year-olds (49.2% male). Student gender and students’ economic, social, and cultural status accounted for a substantial part of the variation in digitally assessed reading performance. Controlling for these relationships, results indicated that students with moderate access to ICT resources, moderate use of ICT at school or outside school for schoolwork, and moderate interest in ICT had the highest digitally assessed reading performance. In contrast, students who reported moderate competence in ICT had the lowest digitally assessed reading performance. In addition, frequent use of ICT outside school for leisure was negatively related to digitally assessed reading performance, whereas perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> was positively related. Taken together, the findings suggest that excessive access to ICT resources, excessive use of ICT, and excessive interest in ICT is associated with lower digitally assessed reading performance.</p>

<p>Focusing on the configuration of the relationship between fate and freedom of action, this article analyses recent self-help literature and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>ies, particularly the genre that centres on the concept of resilience. The selected works and websites all address readers who suffer from depression, anxiety and stress. The article focuses on how the relationship between fate and freedom is represented in three literary figures: the reader, who is promised recovery; the narrator, who promises to save the reader from the mental illnesses; and the plot that the reader forms by his or her personal thoughts, feelings and experiences. Furthermore, fate and freedom will be analysed in a series of allegories and metaphors. We argue that each literary figure reflects a radical understanding of individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, that is, freedom of action. However, we also argue that each literary figure has a shadowy disadvantage, which activates a tragic reversal of fate. The article analyses how this self-help genre reflects a notion of tragedy in relation to mental suffering.</p>

<p>Despite the troubling data that points to population imbalance, more precisely, increased number of born males in many countries, the issue of sex selection for non-medical reasons was not addressed adequately from the human rights protection perspective. Sex selection is also complex ethical issue. One of the most common arguments used in favor of non-medical sex selection, is that the ban of sex selection will simply limit reproductive freedom. Many supporters of non-medical sex selection defend the practice by relying on the reason of ‘family balancing’. However, this reason does not seem to be eligible to justify selection. Problem of reproductive tourism is also present, due to the different approaches of the countries in regulating non-medical sex selection. More precisely, people are traveling to countries where respect for individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> plays dominant role. In addition, there is a simple option to send samples for analysis to companies that advertise genetic testing over <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>. In the context of human rights protection, only the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine has ban on sex selection for non-medical purposes, however, this ban applies only to specific, less practiced technique of selection. When it comes to other techniques of selection, Article 5 (a) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women might be helpful to some extent. The issue of non-medical sex selection was in the focus of interest of the United Nations, Council of Europe and European Union to some extent, however insufficiently.</p>

<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>The paper presents the results of two research studies analysing the views of different target populations on cyclist safety and the adequacy of preventive measures in Slovenia. The purpose of both research studies was to identify the shortcomings of different approaches to ensuring cyclist safety, evaluate the adequacy of planned solutions and propose some improvements of preventive actions taken by various stakeholders.</p>
<p>Design/Methods/Approach:</p>
<p>A field survey was conducted among the residents of the City Municipality of Celje (n = 171) on their satisfaction with cyclist safety, while an online survey was carried out among <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> users (n = 210) on the usefulness of an alternative approach to raise cyclists’ awareness by digitising cycling routes and safety risks.</p>
<p>Findings:</p>
<p>Results show that respondents are generally not satisfied with cyclist safety, as most believe that municipal efforts are insufficient to ensure it. It was observed that cycling infrastructure needs to be properly regulated and that a positive traffic culture should be promoted at the municipal level, including through the promotion of preventive activities. Both <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> users and local residents recognise a strong need to digitise cycle paths by indicating safety risks. Therefore, it would be reasonable to upgrade conventional approaches to raising public awareness by introducing solutions that are useful for cyclists.</p>
<p>Research Limitations / Implications:</p>
<p>The limitation of the research study arises from the fact that its results cannot be generalised to all municipalities, since they apply different approaches to ensuring cyclist safety due to their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and are facing different safety risks. Moreover, due to the use of a non-random sample, caution is necessary when generalising research results.</p>
<p>Practical Implications:</p>
<p>The results of the presented studies are primarily useful to decision-makers and infrastructure managers at national and local level when planning changes and safety measures in the field of cyclist safety.</p>
<p>Originality/Value:</p>
<p>The paper encompasses two studies, the findings of which complement one another substantially and provide a deeper insight into the issues of cyclist safety and preventive actions taken by different stakeholders. They serve as a basis for further exploring this issue in different local environments with a view of obtaining a more comprehensive insight into the key challenges of traffic safety from a broader perspective.</p>

<p>The article aims to unravel the implicit soft-control of users by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> through the framework of choice architecture as proposed by Thaler and Sunstein (2008) in their well-known work Nudge. It explores the dichotomous foundation of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>’s choice architecture in which users are given an apparent sense of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> while the platform implicitly soft-controls them. This paradoxical power plays functions through two broad types of nudges—activity-inducing nudges and passivity-inducing nudges. The mechanism of functioning of these nudges on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> is explored while noting the behavioural patterns they induce among users. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>’s transition from information architecture to choice architecture is also explored. Thus, the article aims to contribute to the growing body of work, which has underscored the importance of assessing web 2.0 as the ‘technological unconscious’ which has penetrated everyday life.</p>

<p>This study examined the relationship between Excessive <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> Use (EIU) in adolescents and their family environment, namely the family type, the family economic status, the effect of parental care, the level of parental control, the amount of parental monitoring, the quality of communication, and the time spent together. The study was based on data from an international survey, Health Behaviour in School Aged Children (HBSC), conducted in Slovakia. The sample representative for adolescents included 2547 participants (51% boys) aged 13–15. Multiple-step linear regression revealed that higher parental care and parental monitoring predicted lower EIU, while higher parental overprotection and lower socioeconomic status predicted higher EIU. The results suggest that both so-called optimal parenting (i.e., the balance of emotional warmth and protection) and the adolescent′s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> lower the risk of EIU. Family factors explained about 14% of the variance, which suggests that aside from personal, cognitive and affective factors, a close social environment also plays an important role in adolescence EIU.</p>

<p>This article tries to diagnose possibilities and limitations of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online media</span> as a digital agora — a virtual space for citizens’ deliberation which could potentially strengthen and enhance democracy in Poland, as well as in other Central European countries. Considering the key features of the public sphere indicated by Habermas inclusiveness, rationality, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, lack of hierarchy, the analysis focuses on three problem areas. Th e fi rst one includes the impact of digital exclusion upon availability of the digital public sphere for citizens. The second part of the study is devoted to rationality and interactivity of online discourse. The last part of the analysis addresses the impact of the relative anonymity of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communication</span> on the equality and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of citizens’ deliberation on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>.</p>

<p>This paper explores the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies (ICT) in an educational institution. Its objective is to understand the relationship between students, parents, and teachers when using the digital platform, as well as to verify how each one of them appropriates the technological tool. Reflection is based on the premise that the accelerated pace of technological innovation requires that people increasingly assimilate their potential not only in the business field but also in the scholar communities. More than presenting concepts and theories on ICT (KERCKHOVE, 1995, MACHADO, 2004; VEEN, VRAKKING, 2009; MORAN, 2015, and others), the article carries out an empirical research exercise in which the authors conduct observations to the digital platform of a private school in the city of Taquara (Brazil), besides applying a questionnaire with three parents, three students and one teacher of a 4th-grade class in the same school. This research aims to understand if the classes are more attractive, interactive, collaborative and, especially if there is a greater engagement of parents, students and the teacher due to the possibility of digital connections between them. In short, the results pointed out that the digital platform encourages practices with active methodologies in and outside the classroom (at home). In the universe researched, it was also identified that interactions with digital media encourage student <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, but parents could use it to become more involved in the process of learning with their children.</p>

<p>The paper investigates the relationship between job design and workrelated attitudes (job satisfaction and organisational commitment) in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>y (ICT) sector. We use data collected via an online questionnaire (using the Google Forms platform) from 97 employees working in the ICT sector in Serbia. The data was collected between February and June 2019. The analysis shows that job design is a predictor of both job satisfaction and organisational commitment. Of the five investigated job dimensions (Skill variety, Task identity, Task significance, <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span>, Feedback from job), ?<span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span>? was the most positively associated with job satisfaction (r=0.629) but was only moderately associated with organisational commitment (r=0.4). The other job dimensions were found to be weakly correlated with the investigated work attitudes, although the relationships were positive. Furthermore, the results indicate that work engagement mediates both investigated relationships, providing a deeper insight into how job design is translated into positive work-related attitudes. We discuss the possible managerial implications of the ?<span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span>? dimension and the interventions in work engagement required to positively influence work-related attitude formation and management in the ICT sector, and we distinguish between ?bottom-up? and ?top-down? interventions.</p>

<p>Digital health technologies such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s present the potential for increased access to care and on-demand services. However, many patients with serious mental illnesses (eg, schizophrenia) have not been offered the digital health training necessary to fully utilize these innovative approaches. To bridge this digital divide in knowledge and skills, we created a hands-on and interactive training program grounded in self-determination theory, technology use cases, and the therapeutic alliance. This article introduces the need and theoretical foundation for and the experience of running the resulting Digital Opportunities for Outcomes in Recovery Services (DOORS) group in the setting of 2 programs: a first-episode psychosis program and a clubhouse for individuals with serious mental illness. The experience of running these 2 DOORS groups resulted in 2 publicly available, free training manuals to empower others to run such groups and adapt them for local needs. Future work on DOORS will expand the curriculum to best support digital health needs and increase equity of access to and knowledge and skills related to technology use in serious mental illness.</p>

<p>The present paper investigated the factors of motivation and the role of teachers in motivating English language learners in the ESP classes of Dhofar University as well as the significance of motivation in teaching and learning through mobile application technology. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Mobile phone</span>s are handy devices that are readily available with all the students in universities and colleges nowadays. Furthermore, the innovative use of mobile applications and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> technology is very common among the undergraduate students. This paper is a detailed description of some of the teaching strategies employed through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s to motivate the students who have very low level of motivation. Since lack of motivation among students is a common challenge faced by most of the ELT teachers in their classrooms, practical solutions centred on mobile applications is the focus of this study. Furthermore, supplementing classroom practices with mobile application technology can promote learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and peer learning opportunities within the classroom resulting in a visible rise in the motivational graph of the whole class. This paper is also a practical account of how mobile applications can be integrated into classroom teaching without affecting the traditional syllabus of a conventional university curriculum.</p>

<p>Abstract We investigate whether the returns to mobile <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) in the workplace are contingent on granting employees <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> over the structure of their workday through trust-based work time arrangements (TBW). Our regression analysis is based on a production function framework and exploits fine-grained firm survey data on ICT use and organisational practices for 1,045 service firms in Germany. We find empirical support for the argument that the returns to mobile ICT are higher when TBW allows for discretion over when, where and how to perform work-related tasks. The finding holds when we account for more limited forms of workplace flexibility, suggesting that the high degree of formal employee <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> under TBW drives the complementarity between mobile ICT and organisational practices.</p>

<p>In our increasingly digital societies, many companies have business models that perceive users’ (or customers’) personal data as a siloed resource, owned and controlled by the data controller rather than the data subjects. Collecting and processing such a massive amount of personal data could have many negative technical, social and economic consequences, including invading people’s privacy and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. As a result, regulations such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) have tried to take steps towards a better implementation of the right to digital privacy. This paper proposes that such legal acts should be accompanied by the development of complementary technical solutions such as Cognitive Personal Assistant Systems to support people to effectively manage their personal data processing on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. Considering the importance and sensitivity of personal data processing, such assistant systems should not only consider their owner’s needs and values, but also be transparent, accountable and controllable. Pluralist approaches in computational cognitive modelling of human needs and values which are not bound to traditional paradigmatic borders such as cognitivism, connectionism, or enactivism, we argue, can create a balance between practicality and usefulness, on the one hand, and transparency, accountability, and controllability, on the other, while supporting and empowering humans in the digital world. Considering the threat to digital privacy as significant to contemporary democracies, the future implementation of such pluralist models could contribute to power-balance, fairness and inclusion in our societies.</p>

<p>The aim of this study is to increase evidence-based interventions by investigating the feasibility of an intervention using an interactive digital calendar with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> reminders (RemindMe) as support in everyday life. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from participating patients (n = 8) and occupational therapists (n = 7) from three rehabilitation clinics in Sweden. The intervention consisted of delivering the interactive digital calendar RemindMe, receiving an individualized introduction, a written manual, and individual weekly conversations for two months with follow-up assessments after two and four months. Feasibility areas of acceptability, demand, implementation, practicality, and integration were examined. Patients expressed their interest and intention to use RemindMe and reported a need for reminders and individualized support. By using reminders in activities in everyday life their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> was supported. The study also demonstrated the importance of confirming reminders and the possible role of habit-forming. Occupational therapists perceived the intervention to be useful at the rehabilitation clinics and the weekly support conversations enabled successful implementation. This study confirmed the importance of basing and tailoring the intervention to patients’ needs and thus being person-centered.</p>

<p>The article addresses the concept of conviviality created by Ivan Illich in the 1970s. That concept is still very interesting for rethinking production, consumption and education parameters in our society, as it defends that communities must be more autonomous from institutions. Authors such as Manzini and Thackara have recently brought these ideas back. Conviviality has been associated to sustainability, since it reduces the demand for material goods. It is possible to develop decentralised systems for learning and teaching, with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. And it is possible to create objects in a more autonomous way, sothat people can have an active part. This paper investigates conviviality in education and design and presents the examples of convivial learning and creationthat happened at a University Design course, and at bamboo design workshops and a clothes refashioning event.</p>

<p>The relationship between self-control and media use is complicated. Loss of self-control capacity has been linked to generally higher levels of media use, which might represent self-regulatory failure, but could also be attempts at replenishing self-control. Indeed, self-determination theory proposes that satisfying intrinsic psychological needs (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness), for example via media use, aids the recovery of self-control. In this 2-wave survey (N = 395), we examined the interplay of users’ self-control capacity and their perceived satisfaction of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness needs via media use and alternative leisure activities. Satisfaction of intrinsic needs during leisure activities increased self-control capacity at the end of the evening. Feelings of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and competence during TV and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use, and competence during socializing, positively contributed to greater self-control. However, respondents with less self-control capacity before primetime experienced less intrinsic need satisfaction while engaged with TV, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, reading, sports, and socializing, diminishing self-control at bedtime.

<p>Purpose The purpose of this study is to evaluate the Special <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> policy to improve the community welfare of Papua Province. Design/methodology/approach This study was carried out using a qualitative approach assessing program activities and client satisfaction. It focused on program activity, target and implementation effectively and efficiently, involving the client’s evaluation process. Research data was obtained from the Papua Regional Development Planning Agency and separated into primary and secondary sources. Primary data was obtained through observation, interview and documentation from several informants. The informants were determined based on the role and involvement in the Papua Province Special <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span>. Secondary data sources were obtained through field studies, scientific journals, previous research, written documents from relevant agencies, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and electronic and print media. Findings This study exhibits characteristics of Papua Province Special <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span>, which are identical to an asymmetric decentralization model, although it took 20 years of implementation because of the lack of evaluation and improvement. It disproves Katorobo’s (2004) theory that the said asymmetric decentralization model is more effective than symmetrical decentralization. Material requirement planning (MRP) empowerment or abolition should be considered important because of the lack of positive results. Otsus needs to improve the system and financial management, considering financial distribution for developed regions in the coastal areas and plains rather than mountainous regions. Originality/value This research was conducted because of the phenomenon of Papua Province Special <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span>, also driven by the problems in the implementation of Special <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> Policy for Papua Province that had not borne optimum results. This study aimed to make recommendations for the Special <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> policy of the Papua Province to improve community welfare.</p>

<p>The introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in our contemporary society imposes historically unique challenges for humankind. The emerging <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of AI holds unique potentials of eternal life of robots, AI and algorithms alongside unprecedented economic superiority, data storage and computational advantages. Yet to this day, it remains unclear what impact AI taking over the workforce will have on economic growth. This paper therefore first establishes what AI is and provides a theoretical background on standard neoclassical and heterodox economics growth theories with particular attention to the Cambridge Capital Controversy’s argument to divide capital components into fluid, hence more flexible (e.g., petty cash, checking account), and more clay, hence more inflexible (e.g., factories and intransferable means of production), components. The contemporary trend of slowbalisation is described, as the slowing down of conventional globalization of goods, services and Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) flows; yet at the same time, we still see human migration and air travel as well as data transfer continuing to rise. These market trends of conventional globalization slowing and rising AI-related industries are proposed as first market disruption in the wake of the large-scale entrance of AI into our contemporary economy. Growth in the artificial age is then proposed to be measured based on two AI entrance proxies of Global Connectivity Index and The State of the Mobile <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> Connectivity 2018 Index, which is found to be highly significantly positively correlated with the total inflow of migrants and FDI inflow – serving as evidence that the still globalizing rising industries in the age of slowbalisation are connected to AI. Both indices are positively correlated with GDP output in cross-sectional studies over the world. In order to clarify if the found effect is a sign of industrialization, time series of worldwide data reveal that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> connectivity around the world is associated with lower economic growth from around 2000 on until 2017. A regression plotting <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> Connectivity and GDP per capita as independent variables to explain the dependent variable GDP growth outlines that the effect for AI is a significant determinant of negative GDP growth prospects for the years from 2000 until 2017. A panel regression plotting GDP per capita and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> connectivity from the year 2000 to explain economic growth consolidates the finding that AI-<span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> connectivity is a significant determinant of negative growth over time for 161 countries of the world. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> connectivity is associated with economic growth decline whereas GDP per capita has no significant relation with GDP growth. To cross-validate both findings hold for two different global connectivity measurements. The paper then discusses a theoretical argument of dividing labor components into fluid, hence more flexible (e.g., AI), and more clay, hence more inflexible (e.g., human labor), components. The paper ends on a call for revising growth theories and integrating AI components into growth theory. AI entrance into economic markets is modeled into the standard neoclassical growth theory by creating a novel index for representing growth in the artificial age comprised of GDP per capita and AI entrance measured by the proxy of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> Access percent per country. Maps reveal the parts of the world that feature high GDP per capita and AI-connectivity. The discussion closes with a future outlook on the law and economics of AI entrance into our contemporary economies and society in order to aid a successful and humane introduction of AI into our world.</p>

<p>Photographs and radiographs are indispensable resources for dental education, research and dissemination of clinical cases in scientific journals. The objective of this study was to evaluate the behaviour of dentists on the use of patients’ images.Fifty-two dentists were interviewed using a semi-structured script containing open-ended questions on the use of patients’ images. The answers were analysed using a qualitative-quantitative method of the discourse of the collective subject, and the distribution of the absolute and relative frequency of the answers was presented according to the central ideas obtained from the discourses.The following central ideas on the use of patients’ images were identified: (a) purpose: didactic and/or academic; (b) informed consent: verbal or absent when the patient cannot be identified; (c) discussion groups on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> contribute to learning; (d) most dentists would not appreciate and sue the author if they had their own photographs/imaging examinations posted on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>; 5. most dentists received some information on ethical regulations during dental school and state that images can be used with patient authorisation, without identification and for didactic/academic purposes.Dentists consider the use of patients’ images for didactic and scientific purposes beneficial, request informed consent to share mainly images that reveal the identity and would not appreciate if their personal images were shared without consent.</p>

<p>Early <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> scholars proclaimed that the transnational nature of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> rendered it inherently unregulable by conventional governments. Instead, the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> would be governed by customs and practices established by the end user community in a manner reminiscent of the lex mercatoria, which spontaneously emerged during medieval times to resolve international trade disputes independently and autonomously from national law. Subsequent events have revealed these claims to have been overly optimistic, as national governments have evinced both the inclination and the ability to exert influence, if not outright control, over the physical infrastructure, the domain name system, and the content flowing across the network. These failures have done little to lessen the allure of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> self-governance. In particular, some scholars have suggested that more widespread use of open source software would increase the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>’s ability to resist governmental control. This Essay explores whether more widespread use of open source software might provide the basis for the type of bottom-up ordering associated with the lex mercatoria. Perhaps unsurprisingly, a system of self-governance based on open source implicates the same questions of spontaneity, universality, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> that surround the lex mercatoria.</p>

<p>Gamification in education refers to the introduction of game elements in the design of learning processes. Our gamification approach was based on the self-determination theory. According to this theory, people need to have competence, social connectedness, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in order to feel determined to perform certain activities. We aimed to investigate the effects of teaching presence in online gamification on sustainability learning and self-determination as well as identify the driving factors and barriers to sustaining students’ participation in online gamified activity. A mobile application called JouleBug was used. It contains game elements and aims to encourage pro-environmental behaviours. Our quasi-experimental design included two university courses (as control and treatment groups) on sustainable education with 48 participants. Both groups worked with JouleBug, whereas the treatment group was also supported by their teacher’s teaching presence. To establish online teaching presence, the teacher shares the students’ leader board rankings, acknowledges the students’ achievements, and give comments and feedback on students’ activities in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>ting group twice a week. Sustainability knowledge and pro-environmental behaviour were measured through survey. Students’ performance in the gamified activities was measured through collected points in the JouleBug application. The drivers and barriers to sustaining the students’ participation in JouleBug activities were identified through focus group interviews and students’ reflection writing. We found there were significant differences in the sustainability knowledge, pro-environmental behaviour, and performance between the treatment and control groups. The Cohen’s d effect size value obtained for the treatment on sustainability knowledge, pro-environmental behaviour, and students’ performance indicates a large effect as well. Focus group interviews with the participants and the students’ reflection writings revealed that the driving factors in sustaining the participation in the gamified activities in the application are recognition by teachers and peers, competition, and sense of belonging to a group. Meanwhile, the barriers to sustaining participation in online gamification are time constraints, boredom caused by lack of social interaction, and boredom caused by activity repetition and activity’s inappropriate level of difficulty. The conclusion is the teacher plays a role as an agent in this online gamification learning context. The findings suggest that teaching presence is one of the important building blocks that encourage the students’ participation and learning in online gamification.</p>

<p>The contradictory media messages, even paradoxical, make many parents think that to have a child changes nothing in their lives. However, to grow, the baby requires initially that is established a narrow dependence between him and his/her parents, so that, in the second time, he can take his <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. With through its experiment clinical and a review of a certain number of media messages, the author shows how much certain adults are in lack of reference, which prevents them from correctly transmitting the limits essential to child education. The concept of extimity and the problems of the sexualisation of the culture are also approached. Lastly, media used by children (video games and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>) are analyzed. A strategy of parentality assistance is then proposed.</p>

<p>This research gives consideration to the legal status of artificial intelligence technology. Artificial intelligence as a future technology is actively expanding its capabilities at the present stage of development of society. In this regard, the concept of ‘artificial intelligence’ and the application of the rule of right in resolving issues of legal responsibility for the operation of artificial intelligence technologies require definition. The main purpose of this study is to define the concept of ‘artificial intelligence’ and determine whether artificial intelligence technologies are the object or subject of right. The article provides the analysis of possible approaches to the disclosure of the concept of ‘artificial intelligence’ as a legal category and its relationship with the concepts of ‘robot’ and ‘<span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>physical system’. The issues of legal responsibility for the operation of artificial intelligence are revealed. For the purposes hereof, the methods of collecting and studying the singularities; generalizations; the methods of scientific abstraction; the methods of cognition of consistent patterns, as well as the method of objectivity, concreteness, pluralism and a whole range of other methods were used. The study has concluded that the artificial intelligence technology is an autonomous self-organizing computer-software or <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>physical system with the ability and capability to think, learn, make decisions independently, perceive and model surrounding images and symbols, relationships, processes and implement its own decisions. The following general properties of artificial intelligence technologies have been defined: <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>; the ability to perceive the conditions (situation), make and implement own decisions; the ability to adapt own behavior, to learn, to communicate with other artificial intelligence, to consider, accumulate and reproduce experience (including human experience). Within the present historical period, artificial intelligence technology should be considered as the object of right. The legal responsibility for the operation of artificial intelligence lies with the operator or another person who sets the parameters of its operation and controls its behavior. The creator (manufacturer) of artificial intelligence is also recognized as a responsible person. This conclusion makes it possible to enter the category of artificial intelligence in the legal field and determine the persons responsible for its poor-quality operation.</p>

<p>Online interactions are often understood through the corporate <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> (CSM) model where social interactions are determined through layers of abstraction and centralization that eliminate users from decision-making processes. This study demonstrates how alternative <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> (ASM)—namely Mastodon—restructure the relationship between the technical structure of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and the social interactions that follow, offering a particular type of sociality distinct from CSM. Drawing from a variety of qualitative data, this analysis finds that (1) the decentralized structure of Mastodon enables community <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, (2) Mastodon’s open-source protocol allows the internal and technical development of the site to become a social enterprise in and of itself, and (3) Mastodon’s horizontal structure shifts the site’s scaling focus from sheer number of users to quality engagement and niche communities. To this end, Mastodon helps us rethink “the social” in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> in terms of topology, abstraction, and scale.</p>

<p>The continuous advancement in technology has transformed physical learning platforms into digital spaces in higher education. In Malaysia, instructors and students are gradually adopting the e-learning or blended-learning approach by using online discussion forums (e.g.&nbsp;BlackBoard) or <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s (e.g.&nbsp;<span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> groups) to engage students’ participation in courses and encourage self-directed learning. This study presents a qualitative view of students’ perception of engaging in online discussion forums in a synchronous learning environment, and their views on the positive and negative aspects of using online discussion forums for learning. Results indicate that students perceive <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and sense of belongingness in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>y as main factors that influence their voluntary and active participation in the online discussion forums. Technical challenges remain as a key factor in determining students’ interests to utilize online discussion forums for learning. While future research is needed to assess the sentiments of Malaysian students in online learning, this study was intended to provide Malaysian instructors and higher education institutions a preview on the sentiments of students towards online learning to better improve the aspects of technical, pedagogical methods and policies for online learning as the nation moves towards Education 4.0.</p>

The spreading and sharing of global values that fought personal rights more important than the right of the community through the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> caused the erosion of patriotism in modern society but not necessary give impact to their patriotic values.

<p>The article deals with the revealing of the negative side of the key processes (such as informatization and globalization) in contemporary society, leading to its problematization. The article is based on the structural and functional, socio-cultural, cultural and historical, and comparative approaches. It is argued that the processes of economization and informatization of relations overlap each other, causing a cumulative effect and reinforcing the negative side of the globalization. This exacerbates the anthropological crisis and causes a number of structural transformations in different spheres of social life: economy, science, education, politics, public administration, etc., by changing their social status towards asociality. Under these conditions, information and knowledge are used as tools to promote the ideology of neoliberalism, which is accompanied by the destruction of the principle of individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and thus, leads to the deliberalization of society. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and communication technolog</span>ies themselves are becoming the means for the emergence of the new netocratic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-elite.</p>

<p>Desktop film or computer screen film is a film subgenre with all events and actions taking place on a screen of a computer and using the protagonist’s first-person perspective, exemplified by The Den (2013), Open Windows(2014), Unfriended (2014), Unfriended: Dark Web (2018), Profile (2018) and Searching(2018). This paper mainly focuses on the desktop films with the theoretical framework of “Media Ecology”, aiming to investigate how the desktop film evolves and interacts with new media, digital technology, while influencing communication and spectatorship. Firstly, this paper discusses the evolution of cinema, which evolves through the interaction, co-existence and convergence with other media, as well as corresponds to the anthropotropic trend. Secondly, this paper investigates the digital media and technology in desktop films. “Desktop films” create <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>spaces and reproduce people’s virtual lives, revealing the influences of media technology, which is considered as a double-edged sword. Thirdly, this paper analyzes how desktop film exerts impacts on cinematic communication, while reshaping the spectatorship and audience’s viewing mechanism. “Desktop films” are suitable to be watched on computer, thus making audiences become active and have more <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.</p>

<p>The universal design movement arrived in Australia well before the turn of the century. A handful of individuals, often working as lone voices, are doing their best to incorporate the concepts into their everyday work and promote the concepts more widely. As is often the case elsewhere, the term “universal design” is misunderstood and confused with special and separate designs for people with disability rather than inclusion for everyone. Compliance to legislated disability access standards has created further confusion and as a consequence many myths about universal design have emerged. Such myths have held back the implementation and understanding of universal design and inclusive practice. Australian governments at all levels have shown little interest in promoting universal design principles, save for a casual mention of the term in policy documents. This is in spite of changes to disability and ageing policies promoting more <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and independence for individuals. When political leadership is absent, leadership often defaults to the community, or to be precise, to a handful of people with a passion for the cause. In 2013 a chance meeting of two unrelated individuals set the wheels in motion to establish a centre for universal design in Australia. This paper charts the development and progress of the organisation through volunteer effort, harnessing community support, maintaining international connections, using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, and establishing a resource-rich website and newsletter.</p>

<p>Purpose : Limited research has been conducted relating to the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> during health and physical education teacher education. The aim of this study was to investigate preservice teachers’ perceptions of the value of using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span> for health and physical education teacher education. Methods : Preservice teachers completed a qualitatively designed survey. Thematic analyses were conducted via Computer Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis Software, aligned to self-determination theory. Results : <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span> was perceived to be valuable for the following motivational components: (a) <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (choice over professional development, latest ideas, and learning flexibility), (b) relatedness (enhancing communication, tailored collaborations, and receiving practical support), and (c) competence (transferring ideas to classes, increasing technological competence, and keeping ahead of other teachers). Yet there were concerns due to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span>’s public exposure to undesired <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span> users (relatedness) and how to navigate the platform (competence). Discussion/Conclusions : The study provides guidance to health and physical education teacher education providers on how digital learning via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span> can meet preservice teachers’ learning needs.</p>

<p>This article questions the current vogue of Carl Schmitt among political theorists who read him as an antidote to the depoliticizing force of economics and technology in the age of neoliberalism and its algorithmic rationalities. It takes Schmitt’s sparse reflections about <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netics and game theory as paradigmatic of the theoretical and political problems raised by any theory positing the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the political. It suggests that this ultimately misunderstands the role of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netic representations of political decision-making in shoring up in the 1960s and 1970s the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the political that Schmitt so vehemently defended.</p>

<p>This study aimed to map the selected indicators of health literacy in the senior population via a qualitative survey that focused specifically on its relationship with <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the context of health literacy among seniors.A qualitative survey focused on the selected indicators of health literacy of seniors living in the South Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic (R1-19). The snowball sampling method was intentionally selected. Completed interviews were transcribed and data was reduced, analyzed, and categorized. The identified categories were 1) information comprehension, 2) decision-making in healthcare, and 3) compliance with nonpharmacologic treatment.The ‘information comprehension’ category clearly shows that the seniors involved in this study rated the comprehensibility of information provided by medical professionals as being good. An especially positive finding was that seniors do seek information through the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>, print sources, or other media, even though, as one senior (80-year-old woman) said, comprehension of medical information is becoming “more and more complex”. The ‘decision-making in healthcare’ category touched upon opinions regarding informed consent and opinions regarding seniors’ own involvement in healthcare. Results from this category suggest that seniors accept informed consent as a routine necessity. Inhibition regarding personal involvement in healthcare was also apparent: “… I come from a family accustomed to not bothering the doctor unnecessarily, so I just stick out my arm…” The last category of ‘compliance with nonpharmacologic treatment’ clearly shows that respondents are informed regarding lifestyle modifications that would benefit their treatment, although, few respondents had achieved the desired lifestyle changes.Results of this qualitative research show clear health literacy limits among seniors. As shown in this study, age itself could also be a limiting factor of health literacy.</p>

<p>This article investigates the influence of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communication</span>s platforms on Iranian journalists’ struggle for countering the restrictions, and achieving their journalistic ends. Based on 26 interviews with journalists working in the established media in Iran, it shows that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking website</span>s and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile mess</span>aging applications are arenas of mobilization and leverage for journalists in this semi-authoritarian context. Online platforms function as sources of social and symbolic assets for journalists enabling them to make others see and think about an issue, and act on it, thus employ journalistic symbolic power. This article applies Bourdieu’s concepts of doxa, social capital, symbolic capital and symbolic power to explain, why and under what circumstances certain journalistic online strategies become operative. The findings offer insights into how new media affect power relations between journalists and the forces that restrict their practices and offer potentials for relatively more journalistic <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in a controlled media environment.</p>

<p>Purpose of the study: The aim of this study is to examine the role of special <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> funds in poverty reduction in Aceh and to find out how to deal with poverty in Aceh and what obstacles are faced by Aceh Government.
 Methodology: This research used a qualitative method with a case study approach to provide a detailed explanation and exploitation. Research data obtained through interviews and data obtained also through local and national <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online media</span> and the media data were analyzed using Nvivo 12 Plus, specifically by using the NCapture feature, which allows researchers to systematically compile and analyze documents.
 Main Findings: This study found that the implementation of poverty reduction programs and policies is still in the form of false participation due to low transparency and accountability and economic dependence on other regions outside Aceh and the small number of medium and large industries in Aceh.
 Applications of this study: The findings of this study are useful for exploration by the Aceh Government in order to maximize the role of special <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> funds in poverty alleviation efforts in Aceh.
 Novelty/Originality of this study: Research on the Aceh Special Independence Fund has been widely explained by a number of researchers. However, there is no publication that specifically explains the role of special self-government funds to reduce poverty. Consequently, the use of accountable and transparent special <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> funds can reduce poverty in Aceh.</p>

<p>Public opinion is shaped in significant part by online content, spread via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and curated algorithmically. The current online ecosystem has been designed predominantly to capture user attention rather than to promote deliberate cognition and autonomous choice; information overload, finely tuned personalization and distorted social cues, in turn, pave the way for manipulation and the spread of false information. How can transparency and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> be promoted instead, thus fostering the positive potential of the web? Effective web governance informed by behavioural research is critically needed to empower individuals online. We identify technologically available yet largely untapped cues that can be harnessed to indicate the epistemic quality of online content, the factors underlying algorithmic decisions and the degree of consensus in online debates. We then map out two classes of behavioural interventions-nudging and boosting- that enlist these cues to redesign online environments for informed and autonomous choice.</p>

<p>While the policies National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) athletic departments have in place regarding <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and drug abuse have been empirically investigated, research on the full battery of rules implemented by NCAA teams is scant. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze the written team rules of 41 NCAA Division I women’s basketball teams to better understand the types of rules that are in place and to hypothesize the effects these rules might have on the development of an <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive environment. Using Consensual Qualitative Research, the research team constructed seven domains with multiple categories to represent the data. The domains included the following: (a) program expectations, (b) controlled communication, (c) controlled relationships, (d) controlled appearance/attire, (e) controlled social behavior, (f) recommendations for optimal physical performance, and (g) academic expectation. Based on the results of this study, we conclude that NCAA Division I women’s basketball coaches use team rules as a tool for domination rather than a strategy for developing the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of student-athletes. We offer practical suggestions for coach educators, coach developers, and coaches on best practices when creating team rules to develop an <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive environment that strengthens organizational loyalty and improves the experiences of student-athletes.</p>

<p>Purpose This study empirically verified employee engagement (EE) as an outcome of organizational communication and confirmed that the formation of EE is strengthened when <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use (SU) is at a higher level. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative approach was used in this research, whereby 408 valid samples were collected with an online survey. The hypotheses of direct effects were tested using the structural equation modeling (SEM) procedure, and the moderating effects were tested using the unconstrained product indicator method and the PROCESS macro. Findings The results showed that EE was significantly influenced by person–organizationvalue fit (POVF), transformational leadership (TFL) and job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (JA), and the effects of POVF and TFL were moderated significantly by SU. Although the influence of social support (SS) on EE was insignificant in the full model, SU moderated the effect of SS. The evidence also showed that work–family conflict (WFC) had no negative impact on EE. Research limitations/implications The participants of this study were restricted to a local area. Practical implications Organizations should develop job designs via two-way communication to bring up EE and SU can facilitate the process. Originality/value Previous research has identified EE as an outcome of organizational communication, but this concept has not yet been empirically verified. This research provides evidence to verify the above-mentioned concept and additionally confirms the moderating role of SU.</p>

<p>Marketers commonly seed information about products and brands through individuals believed to be influential on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, which often involves enlisting micro influencers, users who have accumulated thousands as opposed to millions of followers (i.e., other users who have subscribed to see that individual’s posts). Given an abundance of micro influencers to choose from, cues that help distinguish more versus less effective influencers on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> are of increasing interest to marketers. The authors identify one such cue: the number of users the prospective influencer is following. Using a combination of real-world data analysis and controlled lab experiments, they show that following fewer others, conditional on having a substantial number of followers, has a positive effect on a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> user’s perceived influence. Further, the authors find greater perceived influence impacts engagement with the content shared in terms of other users exhibiting more favorable attitudes toward it (i.e., likes) and a greater propensity to spread it (i.e., retweets). They identify a theoretically important mechanism underlying the effect: following fewer others conveys greater <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, a signal of influence in the eyes of others.</p>

<p>In the past few years there has been a significant growth of the elderly population in both developing and developed countries. This event provided new economic, technical and demographic challenges to current societies in several areas and services. Among them the healthcare services can be highlighted, due to its impact in people daily lives. As a natural response an effort has been made by both the scientific and industrial community to develop alternatives, which could mitigate the current healthcare services bottlenecks and provide means in aiding and improve the end-user life quality. Through a combination of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies specialized ecosystems have been developed, however multiple challenges arose, which compromise their adoption and acceptance among the main stakeholders, such as their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, robustness, security, integration, human-computer interactions and usability. As consequence an effort has been made to deal with the technical related bottlenecks, which shifted the development process focus from the end-user to the ecosystems technological impairments. Despite there being user related issues, such as usability, which still remains to be addressed. Therefore this article focuses over the ecosystem’s usability through the analysis of the process used to check the ecosystem’s compliance level with the usability guidelines from Jakob Nielsen and Shneiderman; and the identification of the quantifiable parameters for each principle that could aid in the heuristics evaluation process by maximizing its objectivity improve its overall accuracy.

<p>Abstract Computing in the Fog and at the Edge of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things represent the greatest bilateral data exchange in the lives of others since the advent of the telephone. It may offer more than improved response times and reduced latency in home and personal data services. It may reintroduce user and community control over the data lives generated by remote systems introduced by the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things. At the same time the invasive risks it presents to home and personal security and privacy may increase regulatory complexity to protect those rights. External sensing of human activity through the Smart City, home and personal IOT devices with locational data introduces many complex issues, beneficial and dangerous. These issues are resolved in a legal-technical-social milieu. Together technical and legal controls for Fog and Edge computing may mediate the data avatars we produce and protect privacy, safety personal <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Those controls must be in harmony, directed towards the protection of the people, and subject to sanctions for failure to comply.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span>-physical systems operate in our real world, constantly interacting with the environment and collaborating with other systems. The increasing number of devices will make it infeasible to control each one individually. It will also be infeasible to prepare each of them for every imaginable rapidly unfolding situation. Therefore, we must increase the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of future <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span>-physical Systems. Making these systems self-aware allows them to reason about their own capabilities and their immediate environment. In this article, we extend the idea of the self-awareness of individual systems toward networked self-awareness . This gives systems the ability to reason about how they are being affected by the actions and interactions of others within their perceived environment, as well as in the extended environment that is beyond their direct perception. We propose that different levels of networked self-awareness can develop over time in systems as they do in humans. Furthermore, we propose that this could have the same benefits for networks of systems that it has had for communities of humans, increasing performance and adaptability.</p>

<p>The new mobile ecosystem that now defines the so-called mobile society and the mobile culture is already a key territory for contemporary political communication. Within this culture, mobile applications have become a common ground for the meeting between organisations and citizens interested in participating in political matters through the direct experience that these platforms allow. Despite this development, it is difficult to find a complete and reliable taxonomy of apps in the academic or professional literature that analyses how these relationships impact the field of political communication. This study tries to address this gap, introducing the first systematic taxonomy of political communication apps in Spain based on the development of a self-produced taxonomical model that gathers in detail all the variables required to understand the nature of these applications that are available for any <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>. This rigorous taxonomy comprises political communication applications available at the main app stores (about 316 found in Play Store and App Store). Specifically, the methodological classification was elaborated based on the following categories: promoter agent, app objective, level of interaction, level of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and predominant tone. A very complete picture was obtained from the empirical analysis, which defines and explains the landscape of political communication applications for mobile devices in Spain.</p>

<p>In this article, we make the case for the new class of Self-aware <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span>-physical Systems. By bringing together the two established fields of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-physical systems and self-aware computing, we aim at creating systems with strongly increased yet managed <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, which is a main requirement for many emerging and future applications and technologies. Self-aware <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-physical systems are situated in a physical environment and constrained in their resources, and they understand their own state and environment and, based on that understanding, are able to make decisions autonomously at runtime in a self-explanatory way. In an attempt to lay out a research agenda, we bring up and elaborate on five key challenges for future self-aware <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-physical systems: (i) How can we build resource-sensitive yet self-aware systems? (ii) How to acknowledge situatedness and subjectivity? (iii) What are effective infrastructures for implementing self-awareness processes? (iv) How can we verify self-aware <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-physical systems and, in particular, which guarantees can we give? (v) What novel development processes will be required to engineer self-aware <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-physical systems? We review each of these challenges in some detail and emphasize that addressing all of them requires the system to make a comprehensive assessment of the situation and a continual introspection of its own state to sensibly balance diverse requirements, constraints, short-term and long-term objectives. Throughout, we draw on three examples of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-physical systems that may benefit from self-awareness: a multi-processor system-on-chip, a Mars rover, and an implanted insulin pump. These three very different systems nevertheless have similar characteristics: limited resources, complex unforeseeable environmental dynamics, high expectations on their reliability, and substantial levels of risk associated with malfunctioning. Using these examples, we discuss the potential role of self-awareness in both highly complex and rather more simple systems, and as a main conclusion we highlight the need for research on above listed topics.</p>

<p>This article reflects on freedom of expression, privacy, ethical and social responsibility, in the context of social networks, in the context of the experience of democracy in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>space. It asks questions about ensuring the protection of privacy, freedom, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> users in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> environment. It identifies national and international legislation that guarantee the right to privacy and the protection of citizens’ personal data. It reviews the literature on the concept of ethics and social responsibility, in democracy, in the digital age, associating this domain of knowledge with the concept of privacy, freedom, and ethical and social responsibility, in the context of social networks. The article discusses the concepts that guide this theme and that are directly involved with related domains. It is alert to the need for ethical and legal protection of the digital data of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> users, aiming at the autonomous safeguarding of their digital identities.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:lightgreen">Smartphone</span>s are omnipresent and offer real-time information on the go. Predominantly, adolescent girls have been found to be engaged in levels of physical activity (PA) below the daily recommended guideline of at least 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity, and especially during weekends. Lack of sufficient PA can lead to a risk of contracting non-communicable diseases. The purpose of this exploratory study was to investigate the efficacy of using mobile applications (app) (i.e.&nbsp;MapMyFitness [MMF]) in changing adolescent girls’ PA behaviour during weekends. It also examined the perceived benefits, challenges and recommendations for using mobile apps. Thirty-six participants aged 15 years ( M age = 14.9; SD = 0.30) from a convenience sample volunteered and took part in the present study, which spanned four weekends. Quantitative results showed a significant difference in the mean step count between experimental and control groups during week two, probably due to the novelty effect when the participants were introduced to the new MMF mobile app. Overall, the use of the MMF app seems to be able to attenuate the decline of adolescent girls’ PA level during weekends. Qualitative results revealed benefits of using mobile apps to promote PA, such as a sense of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in selecting PA, the ability to view friends’ postings of PA and self-monitoring of PA. The study revealed specific challenges to using such PA mobile apps - in particular, factors such as the cumbersome and confusing functions in the app that discouraged users from performing PA. Recommendations included allowing users to customise their accounts, simplifying the app’s functions, and including rewards and videos as motivators to enhance users’ PA experience. Although mobile apps may have the potential to encourage participation in PA, a careful selection of mobile app functions is required to engage adolescent girls to continue to use it for PA.</p>

<p>Abstract
 African development will remain intractable in a world where Africans are conceived as constituting disorganised data subject to the supposedly organising gaze of knowledgeable Others. African people are increasingly datafied dehumanised and denied self-knowledge, self-mastery, self-organisation and data sovereignty. Arguing for more attention to questions of data sovereignty, this paper notes that the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things and Big Data threaten the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, privacy, data and national sovereignty of indigenous Africans. It is contended that decolonial scholars should unpack ethical implications of theorising indigenous people in terms of relational theories that assume absence of distinctions between humans and nonhumans. Deemed to be indistinct from nonhumans/animals, Africans would be inserted or implanted with remotely controlled intelligent tracking technological devices that mine data from their brains, bodies, homes, cities and so on.
 Key words: relationality, Big Data, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things, coloniality, research</p>

<p>The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of a web-mediated program based on the combination of the process approach and the genre approach on developing writing <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> among prospective teachers at Sohag Faculty of Education. Participants of the present study consisted of forty-six students who were chosen randomly from third- year students enrolled in English section at Faculty of Education, Sohag University, Egypt. The design of the study is the two-group post-assessment design, (N=23) for the experimental group and (N=23) for the control group. Both groups were tested before and after the intervention. The instruments of the research included a writing <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> scale (WAS) and the suggested web-mediated process genre (WMPG) -based program. Results of the research revealed a statistically significant difference between the mean score of the experimental group and that of the control group in the post test of WAS in favor of the experimental group. These results were ascribed to using a program based on the combination of the process approach and the genre approach via the facilities of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>.</p>
