<p>Self directed learning gives control and responsibility to a learner for learning, though there are three important conditions. These conditions are that the learner must at least be prepared to accept the degree of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> given to them. They must have the skills and attitudes required for developing and managing this <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. This paper throws light on Traditional and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> learning and affirms that understudy execution as measured by assessment is self-governing. 21st century guideline structure is advancing the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> usage to accomplish consideration of extra time-and place-bound students. Engineering students incline towards this to get the degree from top rank Universities or to learn particular course or surpass desires in a specific branch of knowledge. How many online understudies are compelling when stood out from their classroom accomplices is essential for demonstrating workforce and others blamed for evaluation. Eagerness in an online circumstance may be more trying in examination system classes than in other open association classes. In addition, backing may be less frightening, and the quality and measure of affiliation may be extended in online classes. The remote correspondence permits learner to get the taking in materials and addresses from any place the length of they are associated with the web. In this paper we likewise talk about the benefits and negative marks of both the strategies with the assistance of factual information examination by considering a group of Students from an engineering college. We also discuss the merits and demerits of both the methods with the help of statistical data analysis.</p>

<p>Post-mortem privacy is becoming a vital topic of public and scholarly legal concern. Post-mortem privacy is understood as the right of a person to preserve and control what becomes of his reputation and dignity after death. The assumption that the deceased does not qualify for privacy rights, because his bodily presence has been terminated, no longer holds in our networked society. In the digital age, the phenomenon of the digital legacy that an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> user leaves behind after his demise, has led to new challenges for the legal system. The deceased is no longer in a position to exercise human <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> as an active agent. The article reconsiders the notion of human <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> with regard to these digital representations. Taking the point of view that the control over personal information (also known as informational self-determination) is essential in protecting one’s privacy in the antemortem life, the article explores whether this principle may have validity in the postmortem context. Legal philosophical arguments are advanced in a discourse about the quandary if digital personae of deceased persons can be bestowed with a legal basis of personality rights and concomitantly privacy rights. Therefore much attention is given to the problem of the subject, which does not seem to be functioning in the case of the absence of a living subject. Briefly referring to novel personae, it is argued that fundamental human rights need not be limited to the rights of living human beings.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION Today, entrepreneurship is emphasized in all economies, as an important concept that is thought to contribute to the social and economical developments. The changing economic conditions not only increased the participation of women and men in labor force but also in entrepreneurial activity. The supporting activities of the national economies, providing incentives, increased need to change and diversity, developing technology, the easy access to information through the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and social and individual factors increased the willingness of individuals to become an entrepreneur. In macro level, engaging in entrepreneurial activities contribute to the countries’ economies by providing employment opportunities for others, creating new businesses, generating new wealth and adding to national income and creating social change with innovative actions. In individual level, it also provides benefits such as individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, control and particularly financial freedom and freedom on adjusting work schedule. All these positive features are the one side of the coin, challenging work conditions, taken risks that are based on the motive of making profit and critical decisions in order to ensure the sustainability of business present the other side of coin. All these difficulties which are related with work life create a physical and psychological response that is called job stress. Today’s work life consists of rapidly changing technology, globalization and many economic crises that causes the individuals to perceive higher level of job stress than before. The relation between job stress and employee well-being and health has been the subject of many studies. Nurses, doctors, emergency workers, firefighters and policemen have formed the sample of the many studies on job stress due to stressful working conditions and job quality (Cevik, 2011; Goceri, 2014). The results revealed that job stress affects employees’ physical and mental health directly and negatively, and is positively related to their job dissatisfaction, burnout, absenteeism, loss of production and performance, and high turnover rates (Bolino &amp; Turnley, 2005; Flanagan, 2006; Kazmi, Amjad &amp; Khan, 2008; Rothmann, Jackson &amp; Krueger, 2003). Social support is the other important variable associated with the job stress. La Rocco, House &amp; French (1980), in their study on 636 male employees revealed that employees perceived social support from their colleagues and managers affect negatively their job stress. Blau (1981), reported that social support reduces the level of job stress and negative judgments of business through which individuals may have. Daniels and Guppy (1994), indicated that, in the light of data obtained from 244 accountants, social support decreases the job stress of accountants and have a positive impact on well-being of individuals. Despite the individual, social and economical advantages of entrepreneurship, it also considered as stressful and difficult work activities due to nature of business environment. Therefore, identification of the possible effect of social support on job stress of entrepreneurs provides necessary information about correctional entrepreneurs’ work environment and rendering support. The absence of empirical research about the association of social support and job stress, especially on entrepreneurs creates the incentives to do the present study. This study aims at assessing the effect of perceived social support on job stress for entrepreneurs in Australia. The examination of reducing factor of stress such as support would help to deal with stress’ costly negative outcomes that affect individuals and organizations alike. In addition, it intends to find out whether there is any difference between women and men entrepreneurs on perception of this effect or not by multi-group structural equation modeling. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK AND HYPOTHESIS Conservation of resource theory, which is a stress theory developed by Stevan Hobfoll (1989), examine the demands in the environment and the individuals’ resources to deal with these demands in order to identify stress process. …</p>

<p>In this article, I apply Bourdieu’s field theory to research on the trajectories, strategies and relations of sources and journalists. I argue that the relational emphasis of field theory, modified by the concept of media meta-capital, can be a fruitful way of examining the social context in which representations of Muslims are produced. This advances scholarship that relies too heavily on content analysis to support judgements about news representations of Muslims. I use examples from original fieldwork in Glasgow to discuss the capital, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and heteronomy of Muslim sources who are ‘authorised knowers’ and ‘new entrants’ in their source communities. These various positions are evident in their relative success in managing journalist–source relations, which encompass ‘legacy’ media platforms and emerging communication tools such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span>. The field theory perspective exposes relations that contribute to the work of representation but are invisible to other forms of analysis.</p>

<p>In the context of designing eHealth services for fragile people, we propose to monitor Activities of Daily Living (ADL) in order to anticipate the potential loss of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> by behaviour changes. Nowadays, the availability of non-stigmatising sensors such as inertial sensors embedded on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Smartphone</span>s allows the estimation of people’s postures in real time in order to evaluate their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in daily life. Our aim is to propose an unconstrained and non-intrusive method based on inertial sensors, which gives an indicator about a person’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. This method determines the correlation between people’s postures and activities over time in order to compute an index of ADL ( IndexADL ), specific to each person. The IndexADL variation over time is then a useful feature for positively or negatively evaluating people’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.&nbsp; Our experiment, based on data collection of eight elderly people over a 3-month period, analyses the Lunch and Dinner activities with promising performances.</p>

<p>The following text presents an analysis of communication and collaboration as two central aspects in the design of virtual learning environments, noticing that in many offered courses the design does not necessarily focus on creating learning communities, but to develop a series of learning activities that basically maintain a control scheme by teaching through moderation and instructions, which leaves little margin for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and self-management among students. To this end, has been analyzed the MOOC <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies in Education in the Coursera platform. The working methodology was based on the review of the main concepts (communication and collaboration) discussed in relation to the AVA, the main topics of discussion forums, management students in learning communities, participation in various communication channels, results of course approval. These results demonstrated that communication and collaboration is possible in MOOCs, and how <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and motivation is substantial for collaborative efforts among hundreds of participants. The study confirmed that collaborative products can be made voluntarily, if participants have a common language and similar incentives.</p>

<p>Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of this paper is to explore the ways to encourage members in QQ knowledge-communication groups to persistently share knowledge in terms of contexts and autonomous motivations.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach</p>
<p>Based on self-determination theory, three important contextual factors of QQ knowledge-communication groups were selected as exogenous variables and three typical autonomous motivations as mediating variables to construct a knowledge-sharing model. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> questionnaire surveys and data collection were conducted to test proposed hypotheses by means of structural equation modeling with AMOS.</p>
<p>Findings</p>
<p>Reciprocity, learning, and altruism have significant positive influence on persistent sharing willingness, and the degree to which each factor influences persistent sharing willingness differs considerably. <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> support, perceived usefulness, and relatedness support have no significantly direct influence on persistent sharing willingness, but they indirectly influence the persistent sharing behaviors by the mediating effect of different autonomous motivations.</p>
<p>Originality/value</p>
<p>This study contributes theoretically and practically. First, the results suggest that a particular motivation in different contexts has a different degree of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. In addition, explanations are offered for the phenomenon that suggest that controlled motivations directly affect autonomous motivations. It was found that the contextual factors of competence support and relatedness support also have influence on different autonomous motivations, and hence encourage knowledge-sharing behaviors. Specific suggestions for QQ group managers and information seekers are proposed.</p>

<p>The nature of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and openness of E-commerce in online social (ECOS) networks poses a challenge to the security of transactions as it is difficult to ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of parties on both ends. Transactions in ECOS may, therefore, be conducted in an unreliable environment and be vulnerable to frauds. Trust management schemes, naturally, have come as feasible solutions. With a view to making improvement on the existing trust management mechanisms, we, in this paper, propose a factor-enrichment-based hybrid trust framework for trust measurement in ECOS, in which three levels of trust are used to establish trustworthy opinions among individuals for their transactions: 1) private reputation, which is defined as subjective trustworthy impression among individuals with respect to its feature of dynamic evolution; 2) common reputation, which is defined as collective and sharable trust degree and is proposed with two factors, a consistency factor and a continuity factor, introduced for enhancing the reliability of common reputation; and 3) the hybrid trust, which is proposed to obtain integrated trustable impressions based on private reputation and common reputation, with anti-fraud factor and confidence factor presented to further determine the trustworthiness of hybrid trust. Finally, we list the results of a series of examinations to further verify the performance of our mechanism.</p>

<p>Public policy in many health systems is currently dominated by the quest to find ways to ‘do more with less’-to achieve better outcomes at a reduced cost. The success or failure of initiatives in support of this quest are often understood in terms of an adversarial dynamic or struggle between the professional logics of medicine and of management. Here, we use the case of the introduction of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) to a well-established ritual of medical <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (the medical ward round) to articulate a more nuanced explanation of how and why new ways of working with technology are accepted and adopted (or not).The study was conducted across four intensive care units (ICUs) in major teaching hospitals in Sydney, Australia. Using interviews, we examined 48 doctors’ perceptions of the impact of ICT on ward round practice. We applied the concept of institutional logics to frame our analysis. Interview transcripts were analysed using a hybrid of deductive and inductive thematic analysis.The doctors displayed a complex engagement with the technology that belies simplistic characterisations of medical rejection of managerial encroachment. In fact, they selectively welcomed into the ward round aspects of the technology which reinforced the doctor’s place in the healthcare hierarchy and which augmented their role as scientists. At the same time, they guarded against allowing managerial logic embedded in ICT to de-emphasise their embodied subjectivity in relation to the patient as a person rather than as a collection of parameters.ICT can force the disruption of some aspects of existing routines, even where these are long-established rituals. Resistance arose when the new technology did not fit with the ‘logic of care’. Incorporation of the logic of care into the design and customisation of clinical information systems is a challenge and potentially counterproductive, because it could attempt to apply a technological fix to what is essentially a social problem. However, there are significant opportunities to ensure that new technologies do not obstruct doctors’ roles as carers nor disrupt the embodied relationship they need to have with patients.</p>

<p>Do claims of “free speech” provide cover for prejudice? We investigate whether this defense of racist or hate speech serves as a justification for prejudice. In a series of 8 studies (N = 1,624), we found that explicit racial prejudice is a reliable predictor of the “free speech defense” of racist expression. Participants endorsed free speech values for singing racists songs or posting racist comments on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>; people high in prejudice endorsed free speech more than people low in prejudice (meta-analytic r = .43). This endorsement was not principled-high levels of prejudice did not predict endorsement of free speech values when identical speech was directed at coworkers or the police. Participants low in explicit racial prejudice actively avoided endorsing free speech values in racialized conditions compared to nonracial conditions, but participants high in racial prejudice increased their endorsement of free speech values in racialized conditions. Three experiments failed to find evidence that defense of racist speech by the highly prejudiced was based in self-relevant or self-protective motives. Two experiments found evidence that the free speech argument protected participants’ own freedom to express their attitudes; the defense of other’s racist speech seems motivated more by threats to <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> than threats to self-regard. These studies serve as an elaboration of the Justification-Suppression Model (Crandall &amp; Eshleman, 2003) of prejudice expression. The justification of racist speech by endorsing fundamental political values can serve to buffer racial and hate speech from normative disapproval. (PsycINFO Database Record</p>

<p>Abstract This paper discusses the informal learning of English by non-native speakers with particular reference to the role of virtual communities. A model of informal language learning is presented and related to current areas of interest in the literature such as task-based learning and dynamic systems theory. This model is used to question the relevance of the learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> model, which has been a cornerstone of language learning policy in Europe for the past 30 years. A research project is discussed, with particular attention to the relevant research methodologies in this field, investigating how non-specialist language learners use the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> in their spare time to read and listen to English, and also communicate in English, notably in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>ies through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking website</span>s.</p>

<p>The present paper analyzes the perceptions about cultural globalization in urban Pakistan. A household survey was carried out in different socio-economic strata of Lahore in 2011. Information was attained from the adult members available at the time of interview. The study has explored knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of both genders towards cultural globalization and its influence on the values and culture of Pakistani society. Findings of the present study showed that globalization increased job opportunities and improved the life quality of the people. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and communication technolog</span>ies had improved the parent-child relationships and given more social voice and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to the Pakistani Women. However, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies led to a decline in Pakistani traditional moral values by spreading obscenity and negativity and made life costly and stressful.</p>

<p>Mobile Assisted Language Learning, a specialization of mobile learning, represents a new field of the educational system, which offers new possibilities of delivering content to learners and facilitates the learning process. Mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) or m-learning which is defined as learning with mobile devices that can be utilized in any place that is equipped with unbroken transmission signals[1] has created new opportunities and challenges for educational use. It introduced a new learning model combining new types of mobile devices, wireless communication services and technologies with teaching and learning. Recent advancements in the mobile world such as the Apple IOS devices (IPhone, IPod Touch and IPad), Android devices and other <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> devices and environments (such as Windows Phone 7and Blackberry), allowed learning to be more flexible inside and outside the classroom, making the learning experience unique, adaptable and tailored to each user [2]. Creativity, learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, collaboration and digital practices of language learners are encouraged as well as innovative pedagogical applications, like the flipped classroom, for such practices in classroom contexts are enhanced. These developments are gradually embedded in daily life and they also seem to be heralding the sustainable move to paperless classrooms. Since these varied digital technologies are increasingly viewed as a main platform for delivery, we as educators need to design our activities, materials and learning environments in such a way to ensure that learners are engaged and feel comfortable. This paper presents how apps (for Apple devices) can be integrated into teaching and learning in higher education. Current Approaches to MALL The use of mobile devices in education has become common across all educational sectors and the range of research into the use of mobile communication technologies for the purposes of language learning has been diverse. This is motivated by a search for effective pedagogical innovations and educational applications of new media since classroom instruction needs to constantly adapt to new technologies and interests. As mobile learning has gradually gained popularity, several researchers have attempted to develop models and frameworks to explain where and how mobile learning fits within the context of education to support various kinds of learning. Pereira and Rodrigues [3] presented “the evolution of the learning models” where mobile learning is the most recent model, which reduces the limitations of the previous models. Fig. 1. The evolution of the learning models [3] Naismith, Lonsdale, Vavoula and Sharples’ report [4] stated that mobile devices can support traditional pedagogical approaches as well as contemporary approaches. In their literature review, Viberg and Gronlund [5] found that the theories and models applied on MALL mostly derive from previous theories of learning such as constructivism and social constructivism. With a constructivist approach to learning, learners actively generate ideas or concepts based on their current knowledge and build on what they already know as they are encouraged to collaborate with peers to do so. Project-based learning, a constructivist approach, allows mobile technology integration in meaningful ways so that learners can explore and develop content purposefully and engage in authentic problem-based, casebased and inquiry-based learning using the most efficient mobile applications and tools such as mobile investigations or casual games. A more recent development is Siemens’ theory of “connectivism” [6] which is described as “..including technology and connection making as learning activities begins to move learning theories into a digital age”. Combining connectivism with constructivist approaches offers learners an opportunity to achieve 21 st century skills such as technology-mediated multi tasking. Blended-learning approach [7] is another way to integrate mobile technology applications into classroom practice by using Learning Management System Apps or Personal Learning Environments such as blogs. The flipped classroom, where the sequence of activities or assignments is rearranged so learners watch teacher created videos outside the classroom so that they spend more time for practice in class, is conceptually grounded in active learning and student engagement theories and is made effective with MALL applications. Given that mobile technology devices and tools are still rather new and developing, using an integrated pedagogy in ways that support engagement of learners should be the driving force behind our classroom practice. MALL Apps in Language Learning Mobile technology involves the use of portable devices that are also embedded in our daily lives, such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s, smart phones, tablet PCs and other hand-held gadgets and the fact that learners are already using communication facilities and technology-related activities such as content creation on their portable gadgets has contributed to teachers’ efforts to integrate them into teaching and learning. These screen-based technologies are significant in educational technology as they provide many advantages like mobility of the learners and flexibility of the learning environment, connectivity and accessibility to materials, authenticity, creativity and collaborative learning. With MALL, learners are able to combine the advantages of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> with personalized and ongoing learning activities anytime, anywhere. Ally [8] describes mobile learning as “powerful support for effective learning and performance-based assessment”. Since the arrival of Apple IPhone in 2007 and the IPad in 2010, a wide range of MALL applications have been developed which are intended to enhance the learning process, create a learner-centred environment and focus on the ongoing process of learning rather than the end result. Learners increasingly lead tech-filled lives outside the classroom and mobile apps offer the ability to capture the full attention of the learners with full customization in regards to personal preferences and differentiation. There are a lot of apps available for carrying out a variety of tasks from media creation to productivity.</p>

<p>Teaching languages to migrants through ICT L-Pack Project for Italian and other languages (Citizenship Language Pack for Migrants in Europe) The most recent trends in technology and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>, commonly called Web 2.0., have determined new concepts in teaching and learning that involve <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, multimodality and flexibility. New approaches to ‘knowledge by technology’ are changing both teachers’ and learners’ roles, responding to their different aims and needs. At the same time, nearly 4 million people are presently involved in massive migration processes all over Europe, coming either from outside Europe or from another EU member state. The EU policies on migrants state the importance of a basic knowledge of the host country’s language, history and institutions for an effective integration process, and EU governments are expected to contribute to this aim. This paper describes the European Project ‘L-PACK: Citizenship Language Pack For Migrants in Europe’ (2011-2016), whose main aim consisted in developing a series of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> video texts, accompanied with materials and resources to lead adult migrants to A2 level (according to QCER levels scale) in different EU languages. The project has been developed in two main stages. In the first part of the programme, called L-Pack 1, from 2011 to 2013, the languages were Italian, Spanish, German, Lithuanian, Greek and Czech. In the second part, called L-Pack 2 extended, from 2014 to 2016, the project added English and French and was integrated with new resources and tools. The L-PACK course, which consists of 60 short video dialogues from everyday life, supported by comprehension activities and linguistic explanation and rules, is totally free and available through Youtube, Wikibooks and Soundcloud. The dedicated website http://www.l-pack.eu was visited by 120.000 users from 146 countries in the period 2011-2016. L-Pack teaching materials have also been used by teachers in classroom activities. The authors analyze and evaluate the results of the L-Pack Project, from pilot to dissemination, in different learning contexts both in situ and through e-learning. This is carried out on the basis of surveys concerning the project as a whole and in particular its use in Italian language teaching classes for migrants in Italy.</p>

<p>ABSTRACTThis paper explores the potential effects of digital games on the early latency phase, a period marked by foundational cognitive, social, and self-regulatory developments as well as by a unique set of vulnerabilities. Although research in this area is relatively scarce, recent studies suggest that rising numbers of five- to eight-year-olds engage in the use of digital devices and that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> games are increasingly targeted to younger audiences. Some theorists caution about the impact of violent imagery and unrealistic media-based depictions of people and relationships, whereas others propose that digital technologies offer new opportunities for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, personal expression, and community with online peers. The following questions arise: as the boundary between real and virtual play grows porous, do digital games fall within the realm of make-believe play and serve the developmental functions of solitary and shared pretense? Might the highly stimulating, fast-paced, and immediately gratifying na…</p>

<p>Drawing on interviews with leaders of the effort to promote the 2016 Bernie Sanders U.S. presidential candidacy on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, this study contrasts the structure and content of various organizational networks to map the hybrid ecosystem of the contemporary digital campaign. While the “official” Sanders organization built applications to transform supporters into a tightly controlled distribution network for its <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> messaging, this was complemented by “unofficial” grassroots networks that circulated more informal and culturally oriented appeals. The latter are classified according to the models of organizationally enabled and self-organized connective action in digital social movements, with structural differences in oversight and moderation that suggest varying levels of creative <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for citizens and reputational risk for the associated campaigns.</p>

<p>AbstractThis paper opens by summarising the case for student-directed learning in online higher education as a means of bringing about the development and use of higher-level cognitive and interpersonal abilities such as critical and creative thinking. The writers refine their conceptualisations of student-direction, different to, but flowing from student-centred learning, by scrutinising a progressive series of face-to-face examples offering some <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in learning. Nine features are identified as essential in a student-directed programme. They review Garrison’s recent account of learning-centred Communities of Inquiry (CoI), identifying aspects of the teacher/instructor’s role that would need to be altered for student-directed <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>ies. Guidelines are suggested for creating a student-directed CoI including programme design addressing the development, and use, of generic abilities.

<p>Background: The constructions of the infrastructure for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) and a universal health insurance system are necessary for a smooth execution of telemedicine. However, despite the fulfilment of such necessary conditions, there are situations where the telemedicine still fails to settle as a system due to low receptivity of stakeholders.</p>
<p>Introduction: This study plans to first analyse the stakeholders’ resistance to an organisation’s implementation of telemedicine. By focusing on the medical professionals’ interests, we aim to propose a strategy to minimise their conflicts and improve their acceptance.</p>
<p>Materials and methods: The Delphi study was carried out on 190 telemedicine professionals, whom have been recommended by 480 telemedicine-related personnel in South Korea.</p>
<p>Results: Out of 190 professionals, 60% of enrolled participants completed the final questionnaires. The stakeholders were categorised into groups including policy making officials, medical professionals, patients and industrialists. Amongst these, the majority of the medical professionals opposed to the execution of telemedicine. The main causes of such opposition were found to be the lack of medical delivery system and the threat of disruption of the primary care units. The consensus amongst stakeholders revealed low and in order to facilitate the smooth agreements, each expert presented the similar conditions such as the financial support by the government and the guarantee of medical <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.</p>
<p>Conclusion: The analysis of the causes of the resistance of telemedicine, extracted from the concerned parties, has important implications for the policy-makers to derive strategies for an appropriate consensus.</p>

<p>In developed countries, the lives of HIV seropositive patients have not been unaffected by the technological revolution initiated by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>. HIV seropositive patients use the Web as a tool for searching information, meeting other Web users and developing <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networks. In July 2008, taking advantage of the advent of Web technology 2.0, AIDES, a non-profit organization dedicated to fighting AIDS, launched Seronet, a website</span> premised on a communitarian objective that aims to improve access to knowledge, provide a forum for sharing individual experience of the disease and break the cycle of isolation.

<p>ABSTRACT : This paper does not try to paint a bleak picture of e-Government initiative in developing countries or Malaysia in particular. Nonetheless, such limitations, if any, must not be left unnoticed. Indisputably, notions of “success” and “failure” are indeed highly subjective issues. The outcome of something as difficult and complex to achieve as government reform, or higher levels of civic engagement by means of electronic medium, may not be sensed immediately. These agencies must also be ready to transform mindsets, systems, and processes even if this may decrease their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Boundaries, silos, and counters will have to be torn down and done away as clients move online. Communications with the government via e-mails and other electronic channels will be made a mere routine norm, delivered to the public clients any time of the day across any time zone and in any continent. The implementation of a fully connected Malaysian government also requires empowering the government workforce. Bureaucratic agencies must focus their interest to empowering employees by providing them the tools to perform and deliver their duties better and from any workspace. Therefore, there is an urgent need to make human capital planning a strategic element in the agencies’ initiatives. An effective and fully connected Malaysian e-Government initiative poses challenges on how they might devise policies to spur and inspire local innovation and on how they might integrate which technology to achieve their objectives to a greater degree. Key words: e-Government, Malaysian nation-state, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>y, bureaucratic reform, and effective management.

<p>This paper aims to expose the results of a qualitative research process based by participatory research methodology, developed within a research of Theory and Pedagogical Practice in the Instruction of Professors, from the StrictoSensu Post-Graduate Program in Education (PPGE) at Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Parana (PUCPR), Curitiba, Brazil, as part of the activities of the research group Pedagogical Practice on Teaching and Learning with Educational Technologies (PRAPETEC) research group. From 2013 to 2016, several actions were developed by the research group to contribute to research on collaborative learning, co-creation, open education and open educational resources, due to a partnership with the Collaborative Open Learning Community (coLearn) under the coordination of Dr.&nbsp;Alexandra Okada. In this context, the question to this investigation was as follows: how can open educational resources (OER) development on Higher Education in a collaborative process of co-creation contribute to student learning? The aim of this study was to promote a collaborative and open educational experience for students through the creation of OER as well as the incorporation of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>, YouTube and Whats App as supporting environments in the teaching and learning process. Based on the analysis of the obtained results, it was observed that this experience was positive for contributing to the knowledge production in a collaborative way, with criticality, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and creativity. And also, the students experienced an innovative methodology, allowing those who already act as professors to reflect on their pedagogical practice.</p>

<p>This study explored patterns of interaction in a synchronous Computer Mediated Communication (CMC) collaborative activity in an English as a Foreign Language (EFL) setting in the Saudi Arabian context. The study focused on the use of synchronous <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Chat</span> in teaching and learning. Collaborative learning is considered to lead to a deeper level of learning, enhanced critical thinking, shared understanding and long-term recognition of the learned material. A qualitative approach was used in the data collection process. Participants were 20 high school students, native speakers of Arabic, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The study examined participants’ English usage in conversation, a quiz, and a discussion, all of which took place online, in a CMC format. There was also a paired work presentation of 25 minutes’ duration. Results revealed that CMC enabled learners to further their understanding of instructional content and to better apply what they had learned when they were placed in a group. The results from the online discussion showed that participants’ linguistic performance improved, including better utilization of words. Although grammatical usages lack certain accuracy, the use of CMC to a larger extent contributed to enhanced communication skills and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Based on the findings some suggestions and recommendations were provided as to aid teachers as well as students in implementing the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> technology in EFL classrooms.</p>

<p>Access to information is critical to a patient’s valid exercise of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. One increasingly important source of medical information is the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. Individuals often turn to drug company (“pharma”) websites to look for drug information.The objective of this study was to determine whether there is information on pharma websites that is embargoed: Is there information that is hidden from the patient unless she attests to being a health care provider? We discuss the implications of our findings for health care ethics.We reviewed a convenience sample of 40 pharma websites for “professionals-only” areas and determined whether access to those areas was restricted, requiring attestation that the user is a health care professional in the United States.Of the 40 websites reviewed, 38 had information that was labeled for health care professionals-only. Of these, 24 required the user to certify their status as a health care provider before they were able to access this “hidden” information.Many pharma websites include information in a “professionals-only” section. Of these, the majority require attestation that the user is a health care professional before they can access the information. This leaves patients with two bad choices: (1) not accessing the information or (2) lying about being a health care professional. Both of these outcomes are unacceptable. In the first instance, the patient’s access to information is limited, potentially impairing their health and their ability to make reasonable and well-informed decisions.

<p>This article is aimed at presenting a complex approach to the media <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> concept, with particular focus on the most real aspects of journalistic activity and the factors affecting them. The paper actualizes the notion of media and professional <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, introduces the Western tradition of journalistic culture and considers the decisions being made and how they affect professional independence in Lithuanian newsrooms. The practical research part of this piece mostly focuses on newsrooms operating online. Based on the findings of the research conducted on the relationships of business and government structures with the media, and the data of the survey of editors and journalists, it can be stated that several factors affect the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of newsrooms and journalists of Lithuanian <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> portals: 1) the owners of a media outlet; 2) the political and business interests of the owners; 3) an absence of ethical norms, such as documents regulating professional activities; 4) an absence of mechanisms for feedback and resolution of conflicts of interests; 5) a lack of transparency and impartiality in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> portals; 6) political and business interests; 7) the hierarchical structure of an editorial office. An analysis of the information about owners and documents published in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> portals revealed that the editorial offices either do not provide any information about the shareholders (owners) altogether or this information is provided to the general public in a laconic and sleek manner. Regardless of the fact that some of the portals provide information that shareholders do not interfere with the work of the editorial office, none of them referred to a mechanism for dissociating the editorial office from the interests of the owners (shareholders). The portals do not provide information about the mechanisms for resolving conflicts (between the readers and the newsroom) operated in the newsrooms. Moreover, there is no information on how the conflicts of editors and journalists pertaining to professional ethics are resolved. The majority of newsrooms (except for Delfi.lt) do not familiarize readers with their work culture. The survey of the journalists and editors of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> media outlets revealed that the newsrooms are not sufficiently autonomous – the majority of those surveyed do not think they work in autonomous newsrooms. The lack of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of newsrooms of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> portals was also corroborated by the fact that there are topics avoided by journalists and editors alike. Generally, they are associated with competitors, politicians or business structures, advertising customers and the interests of owners. It can be assumed, based on the corpus of the replies given by editors and journalists, that a strong hierarchical structure prevails in editorial offices influencing the individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of journalists. The overall analysis of the journalist replies shows that the journalists do not complete the texts themselves (texts are corrected; titles are changed). Although the corrections are coordinated with the journalists, the editors make the final decision concerning them. Moreover, the lack of professional <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the journalists is also shown by the fact that journalists are commissioned to write articles, whereas certain articles are removed from the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> space.</p>

<p>With the increasing penetration of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> in India, citizen journalism has experienced a steady growth in recent years. This paper adds to the growing scholarship on citizen journalism by exploring the motivations of Indian citizen journalists to produce online news content. Through a Web-based survey of citizen journalists (N = 134) contributing to the leading news portals in India, this study addresses the role of traditional media experience among citizen journalists’ reporting practices. One of the key findings of this study is that, unlike American citizen journalists, Indian citizen journalists who have not worked in traditional media are less likely to work collaboratively than those with traditional media experience.</p>

<p>Creative economy has been the subject of a recent and successful academic production of different specialties in different countries, recording social, political and cultural changes involved in it. This article addresses the sense of the changes, recognized in international experience, in our context, centrally inquiring about: what kind of social implications takes place due to the growth of activities in companies in the sectors of creative economy? It starts from the recognition that economic action finds itself immersed in a set of mechanisms of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>tion. Data were obtained on a purposeful sample of fourteen small enterprises belonging to this economy in the city of Porto Alegre, complementing with documentary sources. The study suggests that this type of business tends to be guided by the pursuit of novelty, complementarity of knowledge, professional <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and responsibility with the environment, within the limits of the social and institutional conditions in which they take part. Keywords: creative economy, Porto Alegre city, sociology of markets.</p>

<p>Innovation happens when minds come together to share (Ferriter &amp; Provenzano, 2013, p.&nbsp;19). The commitment to evolving ideas is a cornerstone of academia, informing the varied teaching and learning spaces we occupy as well as the professional spaces where we collaborate, share, and learn: from faculty lounges to hallways, from conferences to journals, from handwritten correspondences to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s, blogs, and tweets. 21st century technologies continue to multiply, affording us an ever expanding arena of modalities and methods to refine and impart our intellectual craftsmanship as scholars and as faculty developers. Faculty developers can benefit from the insights, methods, and examples of the unconference as a powerful platform for imagining and crafting dynamic and potentially transformative faculty learning experiences (West, 2012).The unconference is powerful because of the rate at which ideas can be generated and shared; because the unconference celebrates <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and encourages the emergence of our personal narratives; because the unconference challenges traditional notions of learning space redefining the locations, relationships and by which we communicate and build understanding; and because of the unconference’s democratic-participatory structure (Association for Learning Technology; Kassner, 2014). The unconference is an arena of possibilities that organically build off the very foundations that drive those interested in developing knowledge to connect with others. Conceived as such, the unconference can substantively inform and inspire new directions for the future of faculty development so that the field continues to remain programmatically relevant, agile, and exciting.With the spirit of exploration in mind, this paper discusses the what, why, and how of unconferencing and probes its implications as a transformative approach to faculty development in higher education. The paper examines theory that informs the unconference, canvasses resources and tools that can be used to organize and build unconference learning experiences, and highlights ways the unconference can prompt critical reflection among faculty. To this end, best practices and strategies are offered, including reference to web-based resources that may assist in preparations for unconference experiences. Moreover, the authors discuss the importance of and methods for networking stakeholders as a practical means by which to set strong foundations for unconferencing to take place and become valued on institutional campuses. Three iterations of unconferencing as modes for substantively engaging faculty are examined as a practical basis for considering implications of the unconference on the future of faculty development.What is an Unconference and How is it Different?‘Unconferences’ are a non-traditional form of professional activity defined by the absence of many conventional conference structures (Carpenter, 2015, p.&nbsp;78). Stated differently, ‘Unconferences’ are voluntary, informal learning experiences that reject traditional conference such as a predetermined slate of speakers and sessions (Boule, 2011). Unconferences manifest themselves in different ways, yet all share common principles and structures. At its core, unconference events are participant driven. From topics to participation, from goals to agendas, the unconference works to organically surface interests and problems relevant to those attending, provide a place for them to work, and relies on the contributions of each participant to move group defined goals forward. The unconference approach is in direct contrast to traditional academic conference that exemplify more didactic modes of engagement.To a large extent, attending a [traditional] conference can be a passive experience (Sweeting &amp; Hohl, 2015, p.&nbsp;2). The roots of dominant conference formats date back to the 1660’s when travel and copies of physical manuscripts posed challenging obstacles to sharing knowledge. …</p>

<p>New trend of learning ways is often initiated by fast changing technology and using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> tools to collaborate is a new way of experiential learning. This paper aims at exploring the student experiences in collaborative learning using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> tools in a blended learning course. Through the in-depth exploration of the individual student interviews, the paper attempts to provide an example on the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> tools in learning for the institutes to plan for the learning needs due to changes on online technology. The study results confirmed the students engaged in learning through use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. It was found that the collaborative learning using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> tools in the course was not instructed by the teachers but was initiated by the students. The collaboration was a non-prescribed activity. This study proposes that social dimension of learning <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, could be considered in the community of inquiry framework.</p>

<i> Scott MacDougall </i></p>
<p>This article argues that it is insufficient to ask merely whether proposed Anglican Covenant is confessional, contractual, conservative, centralizing, or punitive, themes currently to fore in debate. Instead, Communion must ask what quality of intra- and inter-ecclesial relationality is appropriate for Christian community and measure against it. An ecclesiology founded upon an anticipated es<span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>ology, an approach familiar to Anglican theology and practice, provides a framework for this assessment. Five characteristics of es<span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>ological ecclesiology and quality of relationality it promotes are advanced. Aided by Inter-Anglican Theological and Doctrinal Commission’s report Communion, Conflict and Hope and work of Bruce Kaye, it is shown that ecclesiological values of Windsor Report and its resultant are at odds with those that arise from an es<span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>ological ecclesiology, providing an opening for Communion to resolve its covenant conundrum. Being a global family of autonomous churches, not a worldwide church itself, Anglican Communion does not have a central figure or body that makes decisions or promulgates doctrine for all Anglican churches. It is not hierarchical authority that unifies Anglican Communion, but of that derive from a shared history and identity and that grow from inter-ecclesial fellowship and partnerships, common life and witness, and Communion-wide gatherings, formal and informal, on multiple levels. Recent events in Communion stemming from fierce disagreements over role of same-gender sexuality in determining eligibility for ordination have greatly strained those bonds of affection, raising issues of provincial <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and interdependence, proper exercise of theological and ecclesia! authority, and appropriate levels of diversity within Communion. Central to each of these issues is question of relationship. The present crisis is fundamentally about how relational bonds of affection uniting churches of Anglican Communion are to be understood and lived. Perceiving this, Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury, convened Lambeth Commission on Communion in 2003 and charged it with reporting back to him on the canonical understandings of communion, impaired and broken communion, and ways in which provinces of Anglican Communion may relate to one another in situations where ecclesiastical authorities of one province feel unable to maintain fullness of communion with another part of Anglican Communion.1 The result was Windsor Report, and one of its key practical recommendations was development of an Anglican Communion that would outline Anglican identity and make explicit and forceful loyalty and bonds of affection which govern relationships between churches of Communion.2 Championed by Archbishop, a Communion- wide process was launched,3 producing a series of draft covenants and extensive debate about them in provincial and Communion bodies, parish and diocesan meetings, journal articles and books, and Anglican blogosphere. As a relational response to a relational crisis, it is not surprising that supporters and opponents of version of now before member churches of Communion for adoption tend to debate advisability of endorsing it in relational terms.4 Thematically, five broad questions with relational implications appear to dominate discourse around covenant: extent to which it is confessional, contractual, conservative, centralizing, and punitive. An honest appraisal reveals a degree of truth on both sides of each question: is and is not confessional, contractual, conservative, centralizing, and punitive. This ambivalence means that answering these extremely important questions cannot be decisive test for whether to adopt covenant. …</p>

<p>The Context of Worth Striking For Isabel NunezI WAS A FIRST GRADE TEACHER in Southern California in the early 1990s, and it was the most fulfilling work I’ve ever done. This was back in the days before curriculum standardization-or even standards; my first graders took one standardized test a year and the results were only used to help us teach them better. I spent 5 years abroad and returned to an educational landscape that was nearly unrecognizable.My current students, who are teaching now, have a hard time imagining what this was like: the freedom and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> that I enjoyed in my classroom. My graduate students will sometimes ask me ‘What did you do at staff meetings?’ Well, we did have staff meetings, and we did complain about how long they were, but we did NOT analyze test score data. We had the luxury of talking about students as people, not as numbers.From No Child Left Behind to the current push for teacher evaluation via test scores and ranking, it has been a really tough decade or so to be an educator. Every few weeks brings another devastating discovery, whether a new round of school closures or a ridiculous-sounding idea from a conservative think tank-which by now we’ve learned is likely to turn up as a serious policy proposal. I used to laugh at these, but now I tremble.Watching all the dots connect has been worse still: It’s not well-intentioned error; it’s a strategic assault on public education as an enterprise. Most recently, the offensive has been targeted at teachers themselves. I’m already seeing the signs of despair in my graduate students as the public discourse casts teachers as enemy number one-even while high-stakes testing makes it harder to actually teach. The efforts to undermine teachers’ unions and tenure, programs like Teach for America which ask just a few years’ commitment to the classroom: All of these point in one direction. If the reform movement is successful, teaching will no longer be a career, but a job-and a low-paid, temporary one at that. Since for most teachers, neither of these is an adequate descriptor for what is truly a vocation, the struggle in which we are now engaged is for our very survival as professionals.I was feeling demoralized, disillusioned, and dangerously close to despair in 2012. There is very little exaggeration when I say that the Chicago teachers’ strike saved my life. Being in Chicago then, as the city’s teachers took to the streets, was transformative. The summer vote by Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) members authorizing the strike garnered more than 90% of Chicago teachers’ approval. It flew in the face of a statutory requirement that 75% of members authorize a strike-a legislative move that was designed to be debilitating to teachers’ unions. In fact, Jonah Edelman, the astroturf reform group Stand for Children CEO, had bragged in Aspen that he’d succeeding in ensuring that the CTU would never strike. He envisioned a state-by-state capitulation that would neutralize the power of unions nationwide. Well, the teachers had something to say about that.During the strike itself, teachers showed incredible courage and dignity, never flinching in their support of their students and their schools-this despite the threat to their bank accounts and the attacks on their already battered reputations. One of my own students shared how she cried as she read the callously critical comments on the strike from some <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> ‘friends’ - until just then she saw herself on the news in front of Chicago Public Schools (CPS) headquarters and was re-energized. As the strike came to a close, CTU president Karen Lewis explained that this is not just about teachers, connecting the event to the wider struggle for basic fairness to workers, a fight that is only intensifying.This was our inspiration for writing Worth Striking For: Why Education Policy is Every Teacher ’s Concern. Pamela Konkol, Gregory Michie, and I initially proposed a book of education history on the strike to Teachers College Press. …</p>

<p>In this research, we examine the advocacy and community building of transgender women on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span> through methods of network and discourse analysis and the theory of networked counterpublics. By highlighting the network structure and discursive meaning making of the #GirlsLikeUs network, we argue that the digital labor of trans women, especially trans women of color, represents the vanguard of struggles over self-definition. We find that trans women on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span>, led by Janet Mock and Laverne Cox, and in response to histories of misrepresentation and ongoing marginalization and violence, deliberately curate an intersectional networked counterpublic that works to legitimize and support trans identities and advocate for trans <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in larger publics and counterpublics.</p>

<p>The article aims to contribute to the reflection on the researchers’s education experience in different modalities (onsite and distance) allied to theoretical elements, to understand the insertion process of the university professor in the distance mode classes (EaD, in portuguese), during the expansion period of the fully e-learning or semi-distance higher education courses (2010-2016). The problematizing question is to what extent our teaching practice in distance education distracts the teacher from his praxis? We start from the assumption that it is necessary to understand the dimension of the process of proletarianization, alienation, wich distances the teacher from his praxis, that is, from his <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in class preparation, from content management and also human relations with his students, in order to evaluate the consequences for the educator. After all. it is discussed the context of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>culture, wich requires a new practice in virtual space and time for online education.</p>

<p>The European Language Portfolio (ELP) is a tool for developing learner responsibility and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> through reflection and self-awareness. The ELP is based on the Common European Framework (CEF) Reference Levels that enable learners to describe what they can do in different languages. The CEF is a Council of Europe initiative aimed at improving the learning of foreign languages. This paper uses the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> to look at how the ELP has been implemented in different settings and to suggest how the ELP may be approached. The paper introduces a small-scale case study of ELP pilot implementation in a university preparatory school. The results from this institution show many similarities with responses in other places, and demonstrate the importance of integrating the ELP with the existing programme, providing teacher training and clarifying the status and purpose of the ELP. Analysis of documents on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> shows a number of important factors. The most successful examples of ELP use involved integration of the ELP in the institution’s programme, training for teachers and students and a high level of commitment of time and financial resources by teachers and administrators. Responses from teachers were often extremely positive, others showed interest but many also expressed reservations about the ELP. Student responses were generally but not universally positive and a number of criticisms were raised concerning the status and purpose of the ELP. The paper provides full <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> links so readers can access the same documents. The paper concludes firstly that future ELP use could exploit the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> for teacher training and secondly that thorough preparation of staff, students and programmes are needed when an innovative tool such as ELP is introduced. The basis for thorough preparation could involve detailed familiarisation with the CEF Reference Levels.</p>

<p>Petitions can be defined as specific demands on government institutions signed by citizens. On the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, this kind of participation has developed new possibilities in relation with the administration feedback, accessibility and flexibility or cost savings, for example (Juris, 2005). In essentially Anglo- Saxon countries, political powers have developed platforms to manage this form of participation, such as the Scottish Parliament, the Bundestag, or Norwegian municipalities (Lindner &amp; Riehm, 2011). However, in Spain these initiatives have had to be channeled through private alternatives. The aim of this paper is to explore the relationship between Change.org, which is one of these sites, to define its operation and confront the formal features of each of the models. To achieve these goals, we performed a qualitative content analysis of the website of Change.org. We analyze the process of creating and signing petitions, the discussion forums, the structure of the home page and the user possibilities to contact the members of the page. The results of the field work show different results on Change regarding public platforms of e-petitions. Thus, this tool for petitions noted for its simple design and its instructions and user guides that facilitate quick and easy participation by users. However, limited spaces of deliberation and scanty possibilities of contact with Change.org team and users distance the page to a public model of online petitions.</p>

<p>This paper identifies Malaysian university students’ needs and preferences for online English language activities on a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> group that supports their formal learning. Two methods of data collection were employed; content analysis of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> interactions, and semi structured interviews. Four main learning preferences or characteristics of online activities are identified; a) teacher-led activities (tasks and learning content provided by teachers), b) teachers’ presence (one or two authority figures to facilitate learning and keep group lively), c) topics or content (entertainment-oriented, grammar quizzes, opinion-based discussions), d) structure of the group (optional and ungraded). The passive participants found the activity beneficial in improving their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communication</span> ability, while the more active participants felt a boost of confidence to use English in a more public space like <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>. The findings indicate that the students are in need of technological changes in learning, but are dependent on teachers’ instructions to initiate the process. They exert selective interests in learning topics and content, and demonstrate partial <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in negotiating the online group’s structure.

<p>Mikhail Piskunov – PhD student at St. Petersburg Institute of History, Russian Academy of Sciences, Russian Federation. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Email</span>: mpiskunov@eu.spb.ru This paper is devoted to the micropolitics of late-Soviet factory and employs the case of the Vyborg Pulp and Paper Factory in the mid‑1980s to shed light on the theoretical approaches of Alf Luedtke and Donald Filtzer, who adapted Harry Braverman’s labour process theory to soviet productive relationships. The failure of the Vyborg plant to meet plan targets led the upper management to follow Andropov-era policies in 1982–85 to raise labour discipline among workers. The upper management failed this task because of the passive resistance of plant line and shop floor managers. My main conclusion is what interfered with the objectives of the upper management most of all was the existence of a high level of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> between the key social-technological groups in the soviet enterprise. This elevated the role of low and middle level managers, and it was their intermediate position between workers and upper management that gave them such a strong influence. Sociologists such as Simon Clarke and Vladimir Yadov reached similar conclusions on the role of line and shop floor managers during research into the organization of labor within post-soviet factories during the market reforms of the 1990s. My research allows us to interpret this phenomenon as a consequence of specific Soviet productive relationships, which have not, in all likelihood, been fundamentally changed by Russia’s market reforms but even reinforced. Thus, the existence of forms of social inequality and power distribution within soviet industrial enterprises led to the distortion of Fordist (inspired by Taylor system) models of management, used by the Soviet authorities and the new industrial private owners alike. This explains the independent behavior of this group, a feature recognized by sociologists such as Simon Clarke in the 1990’s.</p>

<p>One aspect that needs to be studied more deeply about the village administration in the era of village <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is the ability of the human resources in the management of village government in accordance village governance objectives and the demands of, “Undang – undang no 06 Tahun 2014 about the village. The capacity of the village government deemed not qualified to run the authority possessed by law the village. Weak capacity of rural government impact on law implementation failure that led to the poor rural village development. This study examines these issues. This study used qualitative research methods. The unit of analysis of this research that the village government Landungsari Dau District of Malang, East Java. This study was conducted over three years (2016, 2017, 2018). The findings of the research during the last four months in the first year of the study is Landungsari village administration showed a good performance in governance at the village of village <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> era (the era of the Village Law. The village government is able to carry out rural development planning, village administrative governance, and the financial management of the village properly. Nevertheless, the village government also faces serious problems is the lack of human resource capacity of the village administration, village very less quantity, and village officials do not understand the duties of each. To address these issues, the village government seeks to organize village governance based on information technology (e-government), but the effort has not worked well because the village government does not have a human resources professional in the field of information technology and the village government does not have enough budget to develop the e-government program. Therefore, the research team conducting FGD on the development of e-government program. FGD village government resulted in an agreement in cooperation with governmental science labs and e-government program APBDes budgeted in fiscal year 2017. Step next phase is the research team conducting FGD Phase II to design e-government as a means of governance villages effective and efficient, to disseminate the e-government, and publishes scientific articles on the model of governance based rural e-government in the Journal of Politics and Government Muhammadiyah University of Yogyakarta. Our advice as a researcher is a village government should make regulations governing <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>-based mechanism of public services (e-government). The regulation is to encourage villagers Landungsari to get used to using services based on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, the district government of Malang should provide support to the village government to make innovations in governance, and the central government should support the village government to strengthen rural government institutions such as the addition of the village</p>

<p>In times of demographic change, skill shortage and disruptive innovations, organizational knowledge management and innovative capacity are the key to a company’s success. But how can knowledge be retained with fast staff turnover, global project-based work and parental leaves? Using enterprise <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> to improve knowledge dissemination at work seems promising, when looking at the success of private <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s. In this article we combine ten different empirical studies which investigated different aspects of how user diversity influences the motivation to use <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> at work. The emerging meta-study using the DerSimonian—Laird method (total sample size <span class="math display">\[N=522\]</span>N=522) analyzes different aspects of user diversity and their correlation with eight motives for SNS usage: information, importance, contact, self-presentation, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, social comparison, and power and control. We found that that the individual achievement motivation correlates positively with the motives importance, power, information and self-presentation. The need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> correlates with openness to new experiences and the need for social comparison with gender and neuroticism. From our findings, we derive practical implications for designing a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span> for work which fulfills the users’ needs and functions along their motivation.</p>

<p>Singapore has one of the tightest regulations over assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) in Asia, a consequence of Singapore’s strong state, the priority it gives to reproduction, and the numerous religious groups in the country and their direct and indirect influence on the Bioethics Advisory Committee, which recommends ART regulations for the country. Together, these key actors give shape to the ‘local moral worlds’, which undergird ART governance in the country. Drawing on in-depth interviews and data from online forums, we illustrate Singaporean fertility seekers’ attempts to juggle myriad and sometimes confusing obligations to the state, society and religion in making reproductive choices. We then explore the limits and possibilities for fertility seekers to circumvent the restrictive rules and ‘moral safety valves’ set in place in their home country simply by stepping out to another jurisdiction across national borders. The paper goes on to show how the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> communities serve as a bridgespace, propelling fertility mobilities by enabling Singaporeans to see creative possibilities in patchwork regulations. At the edges of state and religious power, fertility-seeking subjects take advantage of liminal spaces, grey areas, or permissive regimes to gain several degrees of freedom to practise adaptive fertility strategies that may be ‘unofficial’ but ‘licit’ or ‘socially acceptable’.</p>

<p>Emerging adults are encountering a developmental stage in a polymediated world that brings <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, intimacy, and identity to the forefront of their transition from adolescence to adulthood. This study focuses on traditionally-aged college students who are deeply immersed with digital technology and communication as a primary method to communicate and interact with peers, partners, teachers, and family members. To understand the relationship between digital communication and emerging adulthood, researchers facilitated a qualitative study grounded in ethnomethodological and dramaturgical perspective to uncover the unique ways in which college students make sense of their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> during this developmental time period. Data collection occurred through nine focus groups; in all, 44 undergraduate students participated. Findings illustrate four relevant patterns to the development of emerging adults: a key rationale for use among participants that is tied to both ritualized behavior and institutional constraints; the importance of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> with their digital communication use that is often stifled by parental access to their mediated lives; the presentation of an identity that is rooted in norms of acceptable use; and the importance of digital communication to the development and maintenance of connections to family, friends, and intimate partners. Implications for further research are discussed.</p>

<p>Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of this paper is to establish the relationship between psychological empowerment (PE) and four variables: <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, openness, superior-subordinate relationship (SSR), and climate of innovation (CI). The paper also aims to establish the mediating effects of SSR and CI on PE.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach</p>
<p>The sample size for the study was 319 employees (197 managers and 122 team leaders) from ten leading <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y companies of India. Structural equation modelling was used to test the model under study. Bootstrapping was applied to provide better estimation of the sample.</p>
<p>Findings</p>
<p>The exogenous variables under study were <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and openness. The mediating variables were SSR and CI. Results supported the model and indicated a significant direct effect between exogenous variables and PE. The role of SSR and CI as mediator was also ascertained.</p>
<p>Practical implications</p>
<p>The paper highlights that the managers of service organisations should take initiatives to provide a conducive climate for innovation. Having the right climate for innovation and support from superiors will make employees feel psychologically empowered.</p>
<p>Originality/value</p>
<p>Although as researchers and as practitioners the authors understand the importance of innovation climate and role of superior, few studies have sought to explain the mediating effects of SSR and CI.</p>

<p>Numerous authors have identified the stressors likely to be encountered on long duration space exploration missions (e.g., to Mars), including the possibility of significant crises, separation from family, boredom/monotony, and interpersonal conflict. Although many authors have noted that meaningful work may be beneficial for astronauts on these missions, none have detailed the sources of meaningful work for astronauts and how these sources may differ between astronauts. The present article identifies how engagement in meaningful work during long duration missions may mitigate the adverse effects of demands and increase the potential for benefits resulting from the missions.Semistructured interviews were conducted with nine NASA personnel, including astronauts, flight directors, and flight surgeons. Questions addressed sources of meaning for astronauts, characteristics of tasks that enhance vs.&nbsp;detract from meaning, and recommendations for enhancing meaning.Personnel mentioned contributing to humanity and the next generation, contributing to the mission, and exploration as the most meaningful aspects of their work. Characteristics of tasks that enhanced meaning included using a variety of skills, feeling personal control over their schedule, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the execution of tasks, and understanding the importance of the experiments conducted on the mission. Top recommendations to sustain meaning were insuring social needs were met through such activities as the strategic use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, giving astronauts <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> as well as structure, and conducting training during transit.Implications are addressed for tailoring meaning-based interventions for astronauts participating on long duration missions and assessing the effectiveness of these interventions.Britt TW, Sytine A, Brady A, Wilkes R, Pittman R, Jennings K, Goguen K.

<p>Based on the mini-public theory, this paper examines the mobile <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> public platform in the countryside of western China, and sees it as the public sphere of digital community. The research considers that the public sphere of this kind of digital community transforms the “Half acquaintance society” into “acquaintances society” and constructs the rural endogenous order. Its essence is the new media empower the village elite outside the system to form a social-media-based alliance, and with the village idle staff, left-behind women and other people to form the media self-organizing, become a new village endogenous power. The elite alliance of outside institutions, through express in the public sphere, media mobilization, public action, and so on, connected the scattered in different space of “atomic” villagers, promote the development of rural society. With the change of the village power structure, the elite alliance of the outside system and the village of the state agent have formed a competitive relationship, temporarily formed a relatively balanced cooperative governance model. The public sphere of the digital community makes villages from the nominal villager <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> mode of “self-management, self-education and self-service” through the public participation of the villagers.</p>

<p>Historically, parents looking for guidance turned to a small cadre of trusted individuals such as grandparents and pediatricians. In the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> era, this paradigm has shifted. With a few keystrokes, anxious parents have access to a seemingly endless array of opinions from faceless sources with unknown agendas. For some parents, this can cause more uncertainty, and for the parents of a child with a medical condition, navigating this information can be overwhelming.</p>
<p>In this modern paradigm, the pediatrician’s duty has also become more complex, especially with the shift from paternalism to patient <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in medical decision-making. It is within this context that Alan Fleischman’s book, Pediatric Ethics: Protecting the Interests of Children, should be examined. A pediatrician and neonatologist, Fleischman has witnessed this evolution over more than five decades of practice. As a clinical and academic bioethicist, he has also witnessed a transformation in the field of bioethics, with shifting perspectives on areas such as research ethics and medical decision-making. Because of his rich experience and deep understanding of the past and present of ethical issues in pediatrics, Fleischman approaches this subject with a perspective that warrants attention and thoughtful consideration.</p>

<p>In school settings, self-control is central to the ability of learners to complete their academic work successfully. Learners’ self-control is directly influenced by the ways in which educators execute their work, including their instructional explanations, their classroom management, and the expectations that they express to their learners. Our research on this phenomenon investigated Finnish and Swedish learners in upper secondary schools. Not only is the use of digital technology very different in these two countries; the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and status of educators are as well. This article compares the empirical significance of antecedents of learners’ academic self-control in the two national settings by surveying 2191 learners in Swedish and Finnish schools. Our analysis applies structural equation modeling to two cross-sectional datasets, and the results reveal that the associations between educators’ instructional explanations, classroom management, and their high expectations on the one hand and learners’ academic self-control on the other are stronger overall among Finnish students than among Swedish students. Furthermore, the association between digital technology use and learners’ perceptions of conflict between school norms and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> opportunities are much stronger in the Swedish sample than the Finnish sample. Lastly, we discuss the meaning of these results and their possible implications for research and practice.</p>

Data were collected through interviews, observation and documentation. Data was analyzed by using qualitative data analysis Spradley models which was brought into line to the data analysis techniques in the research stage. The results showed that the regional development of science and technology policy for Bengkulu Province has two agenda namely science and technology to pave the backwardness and science and technology for prosperity.

<p>This paper attempts to shed some light on the activities and facilities in one Self-Access Center (SAC) in one university in Bandung. On the ground of this investigation, a context description of SAC in university levels is put forward followed by an overt statement of the objectives and the rationales of the study. There are three research problems being investigated: What is the typology of the SAC? What are the self-access language learning (SALL) activities and materials provided in this SAC? And how do the students perceive the self-access language learning (SALL) activities and materials? This qualitative study reveals that this SAC is categorized into supermarket typology of SAC. This is because of the SAC system offers learners the chance to look around and choose what they want to study. This system displays materials under clearly marked categories like in supermarket. This typology of SAC is suitable for all learner contexts (Gardner and Miller, 2008). However, this SAC still lack the materials and activities for SALL. Further development, in terms of materials and activities which can promote learning <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> should be done.

<p>The rapid development of information technology and its futuristic lead us into a new era that changed the face of human civilization. New media has become a base structure in accelerating the development of the global community in the last two decades. Digital and virtual sides attached to the new media has brought human interaction and community level to the most complex. Social interaction is in the form of the peak of its evolution where the boundaries between the real and the virtual becomes blurred, and as if no longer relevant when distinguishing the two realms.

<p>Objective In order to understand the role of clergy in shaping Americans’ moral worldviews, we examine whether the structure of clergy values varies in systematic ways according to contextual factors, such as disagreement in the congregation.</p>
<p>Method In early 2014 (February), clergy from a variety of Protestant denominations were contacted by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> and invited to complete a survey online, which included a 20-item moral foundations (MFs) battery as well as a variety of attitudinal, behavioral, and relational measures.</p>
<p>Results Clergy MFs resemble average citizens’, they look to preserve their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> by emphasizing individualizing foundations when they are in disagreement with their congregation, and emphasize MFs that align with their religious beliefs, especially their views on religious authority.</p>
<p>Conclusion We reject a special religious emphasis on binding foundations. While clergy take moral positions that reflect their theological commitments, we find evidence of contextualizing in how they weight moral positions.</p>

<p>As <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y grows wider and more influential in shaping the training of translators recently, the needs to reformulate translator’s competences are also increasing. By combining some necessary traits and characteristics of good translators coming from the field of linguistics with critical pedagogy fostered in Academic Writing course, the author will argue that translation teaching within the framework of Academic Writing class, yields creativity and more promises on the spirit of keeping humanization alive which is at the same time challenged by the ascent notion of machine translation. The growing dependence on using google translate, for most of the students observed in this case study, highlights the importance to embrace both familiarity with the logic and limitation of MT as well as rootedness within the discourse which empowers human <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, thus didactic translation. In this respect, the lecturer plays dual role in becoming role-model for students in translation as well as critical evaluator for their imperfect results of translating text on plagiarism seen from the linguistic phenomenon.</p>

<p>In the last few decades, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies (ICTs) and Self-Regulation have become topics of prime interest in education. ICTs, for instance, are nowadays widely used in English as a foreign language (EFL) classes for being effective tools in facilitating teaching and learning. On the other hand, self-regulated learning is broadly demanded toemphasise students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and engagement in the learning process. With regard to educational psychology, self-regulated learning (SRL) has a notable effect on students’ cognition, metacognition, motivation, and behaviours. However, in self-regulated learning, unlike self-directed learning, the teacher is primarily involved in the students’ regulation practices. This creates a challenge to the teachers concerning their abilities to support self-regulation inside the classroom walls and in a limited time, especially with the rapid evolution of technology including online platforms. The major concern of this research paper lies in the ways that support students’ self-regulation. Therefore, it ultimately discusses how online platforms, the case of ‘Easyclass’ can strengthen students’ self-regulation skills in order to improve their achievement. It also tries to assist instructors in teaching students how to be effective self-regulated learners and promote their study skills and habits through technologies.</p>

<p>The use of blended learning in higher education has increased rapidly. The Community of Inquiry (CoI) has been developed as a framework for blended learning from a socio-constructivist perspective in which learning is based on educational experiences in the environment with collaboration and interaction. The purpose of this paper is to understand student experience and explore new issues in a blended learning course from the perspective of CoI. Stake’s inductive case study approach was used and data were collected by qualitative methods. The results showed that social, cognitive and teaching presences were found in the blended learning course. However, on some occasions, students experienced learning without a teaching presence but with intrinsic drive from individuals. The students directed their own learning and shared the ideas in the discourse without teaching instruction or facilitation. Learning <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> was linked to the learning community through convenient <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communication</span> tools. This paper proposes to extend the CoI with the dimension of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> presence. An Extended Community of Inquiry (ECoI) framework is described and the categories and indicators of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> presence are expounded. The value of the paper as a contribution to literature is to enhance CoI by including the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> element.</p>

<p>Anton Smol’kin – Kandidat Nauk (PhD) in Sociology, chair of department of humanities, RANEPA; research fellow, MSSES, Moscow, Russian Federation. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Email</span>: anton.smolkin@gmail.com &nbsp; This review is dedicated to a critical analysis of the Italian philosopher’s Luigina Mortari concept of care. Mortari develops Heidegger’s ideas on caring as a fundamental component of human existence. This plot can act as a significant resource to explain the social, given the unprecedented scope of the necessary care for people as a biological species about each other, from maternal attention to the division of labour. According Mortari, care means satisfying those needs of the Other, who is unable to satisfy on their own. In other words this is a service, while real care can only be the satisfaction of vital needs. For a long time care as an independent concept was on the periphery of research interests and preference was given to the notion of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, which was seen as more ideologically attractive. However, a person spends only part of their life in a state of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and during this autonomous period he or she usually acts as a source of care. Mortari criticises the liberal view of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> as a goal and key value rather than one stage of life. This opens the possibility to understand the unavailability of full <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, except at the cost of destroying the social. However, criticism of the liberal model of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> can have undesirable political consequences, such as becoming an excuse for paternalism and totalitarianism. Mortari sees an additional complexity in the informal nature of caring for the Other because of the fundamental unknowability of the latter. This imposes a radical responsibility on the caregiver. For example, being a good nurse does not mean acting strictly according to job descriptions; the necessary competencies are developed in practice due to the rethinking of cases. Mortari argues that care is devalued and is not rewarded adequately not only because it is mainly women engaged in it, but also because of the role played by care unmeasurability and informality. Idealising care as an endearing and giving action and in the criticism of Moss’s concept of gift, Mortari ignores the function of the gift in assembling the social.</p>

<p>Tools meant to standardize and rationalize clinical practice have been widely used in healthcare institutions. One tool in particular, clinical pathways, has been a key component of the recent public hospital reform in China. Clinical pathways regulate how the core activities of the medical professional should be performed. Examining pathway implementation and physicians’ attitude toward them may shed light on the extent of discretion and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> physicians have in their core activities. Therefore, this study takes clinical pathways as a lens through which to study Chinese physicians’ work and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and asks three questions: First, what is the attitude of physicians toward clinical pathways? Second, how are pathways implemented in physicians’ practice? And third, what are the determinants of physicians’ attitude? Both quantitative and qualitative data are used to explore the research questions. The quantitative data come from a survey of 158 physicians in three tertiary hospitals in two provincial capitals. The qualitative data are from all online discussions about clinical pathways on one of the most popular <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking website</span>s for physicians and hospital administrators. The findings are consistent with the prediction based on sociological theorization of rationalization in professional work. Namely, there are two distinct dimensions in physicians’ attitude toward clinical pathways: physicians felt that pathways made their practice more scientific, but they also felt that the pathways were burdensome and restrictive. Physicians were in general heavily involved in the process of pathway implementation, and restrictive monitoring and sanctioning practices were relatively uncommon. Factors associated with pathway implementation were important predictors of physicians’ attitude, whereas professional orientation and concerns with the status of the profession had limited effect. Taken together, the findings from this exploratory study suggest that although physicians in China9s public hospitals are dependent on their organizations, they retain considerable discretion in the implementation and use of clinical pathways. On the other hand, physicians’ views of clinical pathways are more prominently shaped by organizational factors than by their professional orientation.</p>

<p>Abstract Multi-faceted systems of the future will entail complex logic and reasoning with many levels of reasoning in intricate arrangement. The organization of these systems involves a web of connections and demonstrates self-driven adaptability. They are designed for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and may exhibit emergent behavior that can be visualized. They will impact manufacturing industry, defense, healthcare, energy, transportation, emergency response, agriculture and society overall. The success will come how the current challenges related to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security, interoperability, privacy, safety and socio-technical aspects mainly interaction of human behavior and complex adaptive systems are handled Complex Adaptive Systems have dynamically changing meta-architectures. Finding an optimal architecture for these systems is a multi-criteria decision making problem often involving many objectives in the order of 20 or more. This creates “Pareto Breakdown“ which prevents ordinary multi-objective optimization approaches from effectively searching for an optimal solution; saturating the decision maker with large sets of solutions that may not be representative for a compromise architecture selection from the solution space. Our quest continues to handle complexities to design and operate these systems. The challenge in Complex Adaptive Systems design is to create an organized complexity that will allow a system to achieve its goals. Researchers from academia, industry and government met in Chicago, Illinois, on October 30 to November 1, 2017, to share their findings and expand the boundaries of research in Complex Adaptive Systems. This year we are concentered on the current state of practice in Engineering <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span> Physical Systems. This publication of the Complex Adaptive Systems Proceedings series contains the edited versions of the technical presentations of Complex Adaptive Systems held October 30 to November 1, 2017, in Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A. The extended version of each selected paper was reviewed by two referees, then revised, edited and condensed to the format herein. I would like to express my gratitude to the plenary speakers at the conference for their invaluable contributions through their talks. Further, I wish to express my gratitude to all authors for their contributions to this volume of proceedings and for their presentations at the conference, as well as, to all referees for their comments and suggestions for revising the papers. I would like to mention our appreciation to the conference sponsors for bringing real life dimension, issues and engineering problems to the meeting. I would also like to thank Sue Turner and Latesha Zach for all their help and efforts that enabled me to sail smoothly in the organization of this conference and production of this volume.</p>

<p>The book The Mediated Construction of Reality by Nick Couldry and Andreas Hepp, published by Polity Press, presents an attempt at reconsidering the classics of social theory, namely Berger and Luckmann’s phenomenology. Half a century after the appearance of The Social Construction of Reality, two renowned media researchers ask new questions about the ways of making and understanding the social world. Today‘s world has become profoundly mediatized, and the social gets increasingly rooted in the technological infrastructure of digital communication. The pervasive mediatization of social life transforms all of its segments on both the micro- and macro-levels. The algorithms of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and other computer systems quantify and automate social processes which used to be perceived as qualitative. In order to understand this world, social theory has to revise its approaches and basic notions. According to Couldry and Hepp, the classical optics of Berger and Luckmann’s social constructionism is no longer suitable, developing a materialist phenomenology which emphasizes the role of media technologies in constructing the social world. Furthermore, these authors regard the social world as a complex network of figurations, using and adapting the ideas of Norbert Elias. Their work has a pronounced critical purpose: the authors are concerned about the relative <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of social life, which is coming under control of technological systems’ imperatives and dictated by their developers’ commercial interests. The time is approaching when the social is no longer constructed in everyday human interactions, but produced by means of various media platforms instead. Nowadays, these platforms provide us with access to the social world and constitute its space. Does this mean the end of the social construction of reality, as well as the end of social constructionism?</p>

<p>A growing number of patients make up their minds about some medical issue before they see their provider, either by googling their symptoms or asking a friend. They’ve made up their minds before coming in, and they resist their provider’s recommendations even after receiving information and advice from their provider. This is a new kind of medical <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> problem; it differs from cases of standard consent, futility, or conscientious refusal. Providers sometimes call this problem “Dr.&nbsp;Google.” I call it premature consent. Providers may wonder whether these patient decisions command the same deference and respect as other patient decisions. The answer is “no,” for these patients are neither fully competent nor properly informed. They typically appear to be competent, but competence includes the ability to deliberate, and they are not deliberating well when they make up their minds before consulting a qualified provider. They seem informed, especially after talking to their provider, but they are misinformed about what sources of medical advice to trust. Moreover, being informed requires believing the information one has received, and these patients sometimes don’t believe the information their provider gives them.</p>

<p>Background: Doctors generally do not work permanently at hospitals. Doctors are expected to deliver quality medical service at the hospitals. However, hospitals often find it difficult to exercise efective managerial control over the quality of medical services. This study aimed to investigate the effect of doctor’s personality, job characteristic, payment method, facility, on performance and quality of doctor service. Subjects and Method: This was an analytic observational study using cross-sectional design. The study was carried out at Dr.&nbsp;Moewardi &nbsp;Hospital and PKU Muhammadiyah Hospital, Surakarta, from March to May 2017. A sample 182 study subjects consisting of 26 doctors, 26 nurses, and 130 patients, were selected for this study by simple random sampling. The dependent variable was quality of doctor service. The independent variables were doctor’s personality (extrovert vs.&nbsp;introvert), doctor’s carefulness, proactive attitude, self-efficacy, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, performance feedback, supervisor support, payment method, work site (private vs.&nbsp;public), and performance. Questionnaire was used to collect data. Path analysis was employed to analyze the data. Results : Good quality of doctor service was directly affected by good performance (b=0.64, SE=0.11, p&lt;0.001), private work site (b= 2.85, SE=0.66, p&lt;0.001), and strong self-efficacy (b=0.21, SE=0.07, p=0.006). Good work performance&nbsp; was affected by extrovert personality (b=0.08, SE= 0.06, p=0.186), careful attitude (b=0.30; SE=0.09; p=0.001), proactive personality (b=−0.17; SE=0.05; p=0.001), strong self-efficacy (b=0.27; SE=0.07; p&lt;0.001), <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (b=0.16; SE=0.06; p=0.015), performance feedback (b=0.43; SE=0.13, p&lt;0.001), supervisor support &nbsp;(b=0.14, SE=0.06, p=0.018), payment method (INA CBGs) (b= −2.29; SE= 0.66; p&lt;0.001), and private work site (b= -0.26, SE= 0.68, p=0.696). Conclusion: Good quality of doctor service is directly affected by good performance, private work site, and strong self-efficacy.

<p>SYNOPSISObjective. Extant research examining the predictors and outcomes of parenting self-efficacy has predominantly focused on families with young children. Adolescence is a time of increased <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> during which parents may be uncertain about their abilities to influence their adolescents’ risk-taking behavior. Design. Parents’ (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;145 mothers and 53 fathers) confidence in their parenting abilities across prudential adolescent behaviors was investigated, including alcohol consumption, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> activities, eating behaviors, and problem peer associations. Additionally, we explored how adolescents’ (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;161, Mage&nbsp;=&nbsp;14.4&nbsp;years, 60% female) reports of their engagement in those behaviors were associated with parents’ perceptions of their ability to impact their adolescents’ behavior (i.e., self-efficacy). Results. Mixed-model analysis of variance revealed that mothers and fathers felt most efficacious in reducing their adolescents’ engagement in problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> activities and least efficacious regarding alc…</p>

<p><span style="background-color:lightgreen">Mobile Mess</span>aging Apps (MMAs) such as WhatsApp, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> Messenger, LINE, Signal or <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Snapchat</span> are used by many consumers next to the traditional electronic communication services (ECS) SMS <span style="background-color:lightgreen">texting</span> and phone calls. While with ECS the idea of full end-to-end interoperability is one of the key features, initial research (28 qualitative interviews) conducted by us indicate that consumers use different MMAs to negotiate their social ties. In this paper, we extend this research with an analysis of the functionalities of 139 MMAs and 20 in-depth interviews focusing on how consumers use individual services to manage stages of intimacy in relationships, communicate a message’s urgency, or craft social messages. We find that the technological seams between various MMAs indeed fulfil important functions as they enable consumers to mediate competence, relatedness and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> as defined in Deci and Ryan’s Self-Determination Theory (SDT). Furthermore, the paper shows how the choice of MMA reflects different stages of relationship development. Finally, we show that consumers also rely on technological seams between MMAs to feel autonomous and competent in their social interactions as the choice of MMA and functionality according to the specificities of the situation adheres to a finely grained social code. For policy makers and regulators, our results indicate that imposing interoperability obligations on MMAs is likely to reduce consumers’ well-being given the importance of technological seams to enact self-determination.</p>

<p>In order to secure organizational sustainability in a rapidly changing environment, it is necessary to implement a decentralized and flexible work environment. In such work environments, normally individuals are provided with <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and independence in performing tasks, thus allowing them to further engage in their given work. This study investigated task antecedents of work engagement, and further explored the process of how task characteristics affect work engagement. It focused on examining the mediating effect of role ambiguity on the task characteristics-work engagement relationship and the moderating effect of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) presenteeism on the task characteristics–role ambiguity relationship through multiple regression analyses and a bootstrapping procedure on survey data collected from 202 South Korean employees. It found that task interdependence and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> were negatively associated with role ambiguity. Of the two task characteristics, only task interdependence had a negative relationship with role ambiguity, and this relationship was significantly moderated by ICT presenteeism such that the negative association between task interdependence and role ambiguity was more pronounced when ICT presenteeism was high than when it was low.</p>

<p>The contraceptive pill, the most used reversible contraceptive in Brazil, becomes, in the media, motivation&nbsp;for the production of discourses about women. If its invention allowed the dissociation between sexual&nbsp;practice and motherhood, the drug is currently considered harmful in some contexts. From the theoretical&nbsp;perspective of genealogy, we analyze which inventions of the feminine are possible base on the discourses&nbsp;on the pill today. As methodology, we used the analysis of the discourse of reports of Veja magazine and&nbsp;of posts from non-hormonal contraception groups on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social network site</span> <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>. The results show&nbsp;that, in the reports, the drug appears as the motor of emancipation of the woman; while in the groups new&nbsp;activisms raise the flag of body without pill as a political action for the conquest of freedom. We conclude&nbsp;that, in the regime of contemporary knowledge-power, the rescue of the natural female body reconfigures&nbsp;itself as a device of freedom against the control of medicalization.</p>

<p>Due to increasing globalization and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> communication, the number of international marriages has increased. In Sweden, 75% of the Thai population are women, among whom 80% are partnered with Swedish or other Scandinavian men. Previous studies have indicated that lack of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, social isolation, and stigma are important risk factors for poor mental health for foreign-born women as well as for women in international marriages.To explore what characterizes the processes, choices, challenges and relational conditions that Thai women, partnered with Swedish or Danish men, experience during their first years in Sweden.A qualitative study using a Constructivist Grounded Theory approach based on fourteen individual interviews with Thai women partnered with Swedish or Danish men and residing in Sweden.The core category ‘possibilities to maintain a strong self in Sweden’ is linked to five categories characterizing the process that the women go through over time. The subcategories illustrate different paths taken even if there were possibilities to change paths along the way. The women had, for different reasons, reached a turning point that made them leave Thailand. In Sweden, they started in dependency and struggled in different ways to adjust to relational norms and handle prejudice. Toward the end of the timeline, differing ways of recognizing life choices depended on access to social networks and partners’ attitudes.Our study showed the crucial role of economical, emotional and social support from partners and networks for Thai women’s possibilities to maintain a strong self and good health after migration. This implies a need for supporting Thai women to be more independent by providing access to language education, employment and community involvement. The current requirement for becoming a permanent resident should also be reviewed not to jeopardize women international marriages possibilities’ to leave unhealthy relationships.</p>

<p>The coupling of the traditional classroom instruction and a virtual learning environment (VLE) in an engineering course is critical to stimulating the learning process and to encouraging students to develop competencies outside of the classroom. This can be achieved through planned activities and the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICTs), resources designed to complement students’ autonomous learning needs. A quantitative analysis of students’ academic performance using final course grades was performed for a fundamentals of electronics course and we examine students’ perception of their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> using surveys. The students’ progress and attitudes were monitored over four consecutive semesters. The first began with the design of the intervention and the following three consisted in the implementation. The strategy was focused on the development of course competencies through autonomous learning with ICT tools presented in the VLE. Findings indicate that the students who did the activities in the VLE showed an increase in performance scores in comparison with students who did not do them. The strategy used in this study, which enhanced perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, was associated with a positive effect on their learning process. This research shows that a technology-enhanced course supported by ICT activities can both improve academic performance and foster <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in students.</p>

So during a potential never-ending process the image can have multiple, sometimes unknown, authors.

<p>This work contemplates the limits and possibilities of exercising the right to freedom through the use of&nbsp;the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. Freedom can be defined as the preservation of the right of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the daily life of citizens or members of social and political organisations, whilst respecting the utilisation of this right, by oneself, or by one or more persons or citizens. A number of strengths and weaknesses are identified in this regard. The paper examines the way in which search engines like Google exemplify restrictions on freedom: they are enhanced by the use of technical resources that are aimed at the most efficient exploitation of the information available on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>; the resources are not utilised to reinforce the rights of the users. Finally, it is argued that the limits imposed on freedom can be overcome with the aid of technical tools such as thesauri that can produce a positive relationship between freedom and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>.

<p><span style="background-color:lightgreen">Mobile Mess</span>enger Apps (MMAs) such as WhatsApp, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> Messenger, LINE, Signal or <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Snapchat</span> enjoy impressive success worldwide. Since many of these applications are offered at no monetary cost, telecommunications providers have argued that consumers choose MMAs predominantly to save money. In light of consumers’ complementary and multi-homing use of MMAs, it seems unlikely that saving money can fully explain their success. Our paper draws on more than 60 semi-structured qualitative interviews with consumers to explore why they opt for MMAs, why they use them complementary to Electronic Communications Services (ECS) and why they use multiple MMAs at a time. Specifically, our paper follows a grounded theory approach. It uses three rounds of interviews. The first round (20 interviews) established an initial understanding of relevant success factors of MMAs from a consumer perspective. The second round (24 interviews) focused on the role of technological seams enabling consumer to negotiate their social sphere. The third round of interviews (20 interviews) emphasized how functions not available with ECS may fulfill or thwart basic psychological needs (competence, relatedness and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>) as established in Self-Determination Theory (SDT). Throughout the three rounds of interviews, it emerges that indeed saving costs is not a central motive for consumer to use MMAs. Additional functions such as (1) rich interaction using video <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>, pictures, videos, etc.; (2) group <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>s; (3) awareness and notification functions; (4) voice messages; and (5) presentation of self e.g.&nbsp;via a profile picture provide better fulfillment of one’s basic psychological needs than ECS without these functions. Furthermore, our results show that both complementary use of ECS and MMAs as well as MMA multi-homing can be explained by consumers enacting competence in applying and decoding subtle social codes along the stages of stage models of relationship development. In sum, our results highlight the relevance of additional and innovative functionalities of MMAs for their success. These functionalities generally help to fulfill consumers’ basic psychological needs better than SMS. Furthermore, consumers’ need fulfillment is supported by the opportunity to use various MMAs in parallel to adhere to a finely grained set of social codes associated with interpersonal communication. Hence policy and regulators should not interfere with the innovation paths of these applications as well as the technological seams that exist between them. For marketers, our results add further insights as regards potential targeting strategies for developing platform business models for MMAs.</p>

<p>This article is the result of an exploratory research carried out in 2014-2015 in the region Marche on an issue that is causing public alarm, despite his knowledge is still approximate and may not be confined to criminal or psychological matters. The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying is closely connected to the processes of children’s identity construction, of the relation to the peer group and of the definition of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> trough which they can free themselves from the control of adults. It is an issue that can be read even from a gender perspective because if the victims are mostly girls, the peculiar procedures enable girls to behave as bullies. Furthermore many of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying acts have to do with the body representation and the models of masculinity and femininity that define the imaginary of teenagers. The aim is going beyond the focus on the digital tools and their possible emotional damage for looking at the contents that reproduce sexism and oppression which is not often recognized as problematic.</p>

<p>Abstract <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social media</span> environments can transform and reinforce life experiences, influencing self-concept and providing happiness. The goal of this research is to examine <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> networking as an experiential phenomenon, wherein consumers pursue virtual happiness by satisfying the self-determination theory (SDT) needs of relatedness, competence, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Beginning with the memory connection to self-concept, the study proposes an experiential outcome circle for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> to virtual happiness. A circle depicts the idea that self-concept motivates <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> behavior, which influences the self-concept. Happiness, or affect balance, is a potential outcome of this connection. The study analyzes n&nbsp;=&nbsp;504 <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> networking participants using generational cohorts with fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). This study suggests the metaphors for each generation based on the following SDT recipes: (1) “we” for generation Y with relatedness and competence, (2) “me” for generation X, with <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and competence, and (3) “be” for baby boomers with competence.</p>

<p>This paper discusses the findings of a research study concerning the use of e-portfolios to develop learners’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and independence, from the perspectives of teachers and students participating in this study. The findings demonstrate many of the benefits of e-portfolio practice regarding learners’ increased sense of ownership, teacher and peer feedback, enriched learning experience at both individual and technological levels, enhanced opportunity for self-improvement and increased awareness of the learning process. Despite many positive aspects of e-portfolios use, the study reveals some challenges facing students, teachers and support staff, mainly connected with technical problems and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> access, and the necessity for teachers and learners to change their roles to become more independent in the learning process. The author concludes that e-portfolio is a promising tool to stimulate and challenge students to become independent and self-regulated learners that should be implemented in English language learning at higher educational institutions.</p>

<p>In 1959, the sociologist Edward Shils wrote an influential essay called “Social Inquiry and The <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> of the Individual.” He discussed the nature of studying humans with new techniques—which, for him, included concealed cameras, microphones, and forms of “chemical and psychological manipulation.” These could be powerful tools, but they came at a great cost: There is no doubt that some social scientists, with their zeal for novelty, will be attracted by the possibilities offered by these means of manipulating the external and internal lives of other persons. It is all the more necessary therefore, that the leading persons in these fields should declare themselves as strenuously and decisively opposed to such tampering with human <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Shils expresses many of the anxieties and conundrums we’ve heard this week about massive human studies on networked platforms.</p>

<p>The prospects of the dynamic interactive environment that was established with distance education can be broadened by the development of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT). The digital folder (e-portofolio) constitutes an educational breakthrough which fulfils the criterion of polymorphism. Our goal, in this study is the research concerning the contribution of the e-portofolio in the promotion of the cooperative freedom during flexible zone to second grade primary school students. As a basic research tool we created an e-portofolio utilising the Mahara software. In this research, 12 second grade students from an urban area of Athens took part. The introduction of the e-portofolio was created in two phases during the school year 2014-2015. Initially, the pilot application in the program ‘all the earth, an embrace’ and the main one was realised with the program ‘the water’. Through the methodological approach of the qualitative action research we concluded that cooperation and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> can be achieved within the context of the educational community in a distance learning environment with the use of guided educational dialogue.</p>

<p>This article describes a proposal and case study based on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s and QR Codes to assist individuals with cognitive disabilities in their labour training and integration. This proposal, named AssisT-Task, is a full functional mobile application for Android <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s and offers step-by-step guidance, establishing a learning method through task sequencing. It has been tested with a group of 10 users and 2 types of labour tasks. Through 7 recorded sessions, we compared the performance and the learning progress with the tool against the traditional assisting method, based on paper instructions. The results show that people with cognitive disabilities learnt and performed better and faster when using AssisT-Task than the traditional method, particularly on tasks that require cognitive effort rather than manual skills. This learning has proved to be essential to obtain an adequate degree of personal <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for people with cognitive impairment.</p>

<p>espanolSmart product, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Smartphone</span>, Product intelligence, Consumer innovativeness, Service adoption EnglishThis paper investigates consumers’ perceptions toward smartness characteristics of smart phones to understand the influence of product smartness on consumer satisfaction. Recent developments in information technology are accelerating the pace of change in products, particularly the emergence of smart products. Despite these technological advances, however, there is a lack of understanding about consumers who buy and use smart products. In this empirical study, five smartness dimensions of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, adaptability, reactivity, multifunctionality, and ability to cooperate, are used to examine perceived product smartness which is also tested with consumer satisfaction. Based on their experiences with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s, 388 consumers, in their 20s, respond to the questionnaire. Among the five factors, adaptability y and multi-functionality have significant influence on perceived product smartness and consumer satisfaction. However, the other three factors do not show a significant impact. In addition, the moderator effect of customer innovativeness on satisfaction has been proven significant. The results of this study provide a better understanding of the impact of product smartness on customer attitudes and provide managerial implications for new product development and market managemet.</p>

<p>Port Moresby is consistently represented as a place that is dangerous for women. While recent transformations in the city have benefited some more than others, developments in the city are allowing for the creation of new ‘spatial texts’ in a place notorious for constraining women. In this article, I explore feminist geographer Linda McDowell’s idea that the city is a place in which the active, independent woman comes into her own. Drawing on focus groups, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s and photos sent to me by educated, ‘middle class’ Papua New Guinean women living in Port Moresby, I demonstrate that the city’s new places are paradoxical, even liberating places. The article reveals both the extent of women’s subordination in the city and the emerging possibilities for middle class women to experience a degree of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Nevertheless as Radice notes, women must endlessly renegotiate their experience of comfort in relation to others, including those whose lives are less comfortable.</p>

<p>The present study examines the struggle for hegemony in the public sphere by two different systems, following Hong Kong’s handover to China in 1997. It has been postulated that the new media, particularly <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, has become an important public sphere for the citizens of Hong Kong to engage in an anti-hegemonic struggle against China’s discursive encroachment into Hong Kong since 1997. Given that the public platform provided by legacy media has been bought out or coopted by China, new media has begun to serve as a subaltern public sphere to enable resisting the hegemony imposed by China. This was analyzed through a survey conducted as part of this study, which showed that people who are young, read the Apple Daily, have high expectations of local <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and a high regard for press freedom are prone to using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> to obtain their social and political information. This article analyzes the implications of the emergence of a counter-China hegemonic public sphere.</p>

<p>Technology has blurred the line between work and non-work life. Communication and informational technologies like laptops, tablets, and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s enable workers to stay connected regardless of physical location and time of day (Kossek, 2016). Managing the boundaries between the work and home domain is not a new issue (Nippert-Eng, 2008), yet the increasing technological embeddedness in our everyday lives increases the complexity and relevance of these boundaries for both organizations and employees. Communication technology can in many cases give opportunities for more flexibility, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and control. Nevertheless, it might also exert a pressure on employees, breeding an “always available” culture in organizations (Kossek, 2016). Leaders and managers set examples through their own behavior, which signal what is expected from the employees. Leaders who reply to and send <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s during odd hours might contribute to the establishment of organizational norms that revolve around being available after hour and during off days.&nbsp; However, whether or not this becomes a problem is dependent on individual differences, perceived control over boundaries and companies’ availability policy. This review will take a closer look at the different factors that influence the management of work-life boundaries and how technology influences this relationship.</p>

<p>The impact of work-related <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use on organizational and private life is a&nbsp;current research topic in work and organizational psychology. In this study, we investigate the day-level effects of work-related <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use during non-work time on employees’ psychological well-being. Drawing on the Limited Strength Model of Self-Control, we propose that work-related <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use depletes limited regulatory resources and thus, impairs well-being at the day-level. Furthermore, based on arguments brought up by Self-Determination Theory, we propose basic need satisfaction at work as a&nbsp;buffering moderator of this relationship, arguing that for employees with high levels of basic need satisfaction work-related <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use is less depleting due to high intrinsic motivation and higher levels of energy, which support resource recovery. A&nbsp;diary study covering ten working days (N&nbsp;= 74) was conducted to test our hypotheses. Results indicate that, in line with our expectations, work-related <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use impairs employees’ psychological well-being at the day-level. The satisfaction of basic psychological needs at work (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence and relatedness) can buffer these effects and thus, protect employees from impairments of well-being. Practical relevance: Technological innovations such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s allow employees to work anywhere, at any time, thus blurring the lines between different life domains and endangering employees’ well-being. Our study suggests different practical interventions to prevent such impairments of well-being for both organizations and individuals.</p>

A robot-virtual human bilateral trust model is derived and a real-time trust measurement method is developed.

A scheme is developed to evaluate the performance of the agents in the ecology through the CPSS. The results show that the robot and the virtual human perform satisfactorily in the collaboration through the CPSS. The results thus prove the effectiveness of the real-world ecology between artificial agents of heterogeneous realities through a shared platform based on trust-triggered mixed-initiatives. The results can help develop adaptive social ecology comprising intelligent agents of heterogeneous realities to assist humans in various tasks through collaboration between the agents in the form of a CPSS.</p>

<p>English are multifaceted and polymathic. Alongside our students, we explore cultures, perspectives, and lived experiences through text, often encouraging intellectual development and affective maturation (Williams, 2012, p.&nbsp;xi). Thus, through such diverse learning, sometimes-complicated discussions arise, and texts that touch on sexualities surface our classrooms. Pickering (2004), who inspired the film Dead Poets Society (1989), argues that teachers never escape sexual doings (p.&nbsp;237); if it true that (in general) can’t escape sex, how might English (in particular) purposefully integrate it their curriculum? Johnson (2015), citing Lewis and Tierney’s (2011) work, posits in the English classroom, where personal growth often an explicit part of the curriculum . . . , sex might seem a natural fit (p.&nbsp;61). Therefore, English would do well to develop effective teaching strategies for addressing issues related to sex education including sexualities, healthy relationships, consent, and so forth. Further, finding dynamic ways for educators to exercise reflexivity their teaching practice also important when trying new approaches to learning.I have been fortunate to teach English a progressive public secondary school western Canada where the have a great deal of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to develop curriculum that attends to students’ collective needs and interests. As Brezicha, Bergmark, and Mitra (2014) argue, Effectively leading a complex and dynamic system requires leaders who [understand and respect] how individuals make sense of their work while working within the context of their social environment and boundaries of the school setting (p.&nbsp;124). We have such leadership at the helm of our school, which I realize makes my context a bit of an educational nirvana. Nonetheless, I hope my experiences might have some applicability for the readers of English Education.As evidence of our school’s commitment to best practices, my administration approached me as the English department leader to organize our five literacy to embed a healthy relationships curriculum, comprised of sex and consent education material, into grade 9 English. As Jones (2011) describes, this curriculum is seen as a hyponym under which sub-types such as sex education (education mainly concerned with the act of intercourse or reproduction), relationship education (education mainly concerned with the creation of romantic or sexual relationships) and other types fall (p.&nbsp;371). This opportunity emerged from challenges with scheduling the ninthgrade class timetable, which runs differently than other grades. In an effort to provide new options, physical education classes faced losing critical time the gymnasium unless another department took on teaching the health curriculum component, which how our English team got this exciting chance to explore sex education with a fresh approach.Fortunately, each teacher had previously taught sex education some capacity, including roles such as a physical education teacher, a social worker, a volunteer sexual assault counselor, or teacher of a locally developed career and life management course that included a healthy relationships curriculum. As such, we had complete freedom with bringing this learning our classrooms; we could simply take a break from our literacy studies to complete the curriculum, or we could integrate with a text or film study- whatever would work best.Each teacher uniquely approached the subject matter, embracing the opportunity to try something new. As we taught it differently, we also supported one another by sharing our ideas and observations, swapping lesson plans, and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>ing links to resources. This a common practice our department, as the majority of us contend, meaningful collaboration benefits educators and students alike (Ketterlin-Geller, Baumer, &amp; Lichon, 2015, p.&nbsp;…</p>

<p>Objective: Health sciences training programs have progressively expanded onto satellite campuses, allowing students the opportunity to learn in communities away from an academic institution’s main campus. This expansion has encouraged a new role for librarians to assume, in that a subset of health sciences librarians identify as “satellite librarians” who are permanently located at a distance from the main campus. Due to the unique nature of this role and lack of existing data on the topic, the authors investigated the experiences and perceptions of this unique group of information professionals. Methods: An electronic survey was distributed to health sciences librarians via two prominent North American <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> discussion lists. Questions addressed the librarians’ demographics, feelings of social inclusion, technological support, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, professional support, and more. Results: Eighteen surveys were analyzed. While several respondents stated that they had positive working relationships with colleagues, many cited issues with technology, scheduling, and lack of consideration as barriers to feeling socially included at both the parent and local campuses. Social inclusion, policy creation, and collection management issues were subject to their unique situations and their colleagues’ perceptions of their roles as satellite librarians. Conclusions: The results from this survey suggest that the role of the academic health sciences librarian at the satellite campus needs to be clearly communicated and defined. This, in turn, will enhance the experience for the librarian and provide better service to the client.</p>

<p>User participation is increasingly being seen as a way to mitigate the challenges that firms face in innovation, such as high costs and uncertainty of customer acceptance of their innovations. Thus, firms are establishing online platforms to support users in innovating services, such as iOS and Android platforms for mobile data service (MDS) innovation. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Mobile phone</span> platforms are characterized by technology (toolkits) and policy (rules) components that could influence user’s innovation. Additionally, attributes of user innovators (lead userness) are expected to drive their innovation behavior. Yet it is unclear how these characteristics jointly impact users’ service innovation outcomes. To address this knowledge gap, we propose a model that builds on user innovation theory and the work design literature to explain the influences of lead userness, design <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, toolkit support, and their interactions on user’s innovation outcomes (innovation quantity) on these platforms. We conceptualize toolkit support in terms of two constructs (i.e., ease of effort and exploration), and design <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in terms of three constructs (i.e., decision-making <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, scheduling <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and work-method <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>). The model was tested using survey and archival data from two dominant <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> platforms (i.e., iOS and Android). As hypothesized, lead userness, exploration through toolkits, and ease of effort through toolkits positively affect users’ innovation quantity. Additionally, decision-making <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and work-method <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> influence innovation quantity, but scheduling <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> does not. Further, the proposed three-way interactions between lead userness, toolkit support, and design <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> constructs on users’ quantity of MDS innovation are largely supported. The findings enhance our understanding of user innovation on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> platforms.</p>

<p>Abstract Participation has become a buzz word in many an economic and social context. This however hides the fact that there is a great variety of different participative practices, both on micro and macro levels, practiced for very different purposes. Sometimes speaking of participation is just juggling with names. In many enterprises market driven work organisations offer “participation” to employees, which is in fact a device to misuse employees’ interest in “authentic participation” (Fals Borda, 2013/2007) for increasing the efficiency of work by dependent <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. In modern forms of so called interactive value creation via the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> we find another practice: so called participation of consumers or <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>ies of co-producers in designing, creating or improving (new) products. Even in trade unions the use and practice of participation is sometimes ambivalent. In order to distinguish authentic participation in the interest of participants from the misuse of participation for different interests (increase in efficiency; exploitation of participants’ creative capacities) this author coins the term of democratic participation, characterised by, among others, democratic dialogue between subjects (no othering business); collective reflection; giving a voice to all participants. Finally it is argued that the practice of democratic participation may open horizons of utopia. Keywords: authentic participation, democratic participation, participation on micro and macro levels, trade unions’ participative practices, inflationary use of the term participation</p>

<p>Different studies on democracy and political disaffection are of the belief that the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and social networks provide new opportunities for social mobilization and citizen participation. e social mobilizations of the second decade of the 21st century, such as the Arab Spring or the 15M in Spain, defined the protagonist role of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communication</span> and social networks for the summon and the development of protests. is paper, which uses the stages of moral development and applies them to social reality, provides a theoretical proposal for a three-dimensional analysis (introducing the concepts of strategy, action, and objective) to study contemporary social mobilizations. It also presents and compares the three analytical dimensions and uses them to characterize, in an exploratory manner, three cases of social mobilization (the Arab Spring in Egypt, the 15M, and the Platform for People Affected by Mortgages in Spain). In the text, the use of social net- works and the media is a transverse study based on the three dimensions proposed. e analysis shows that some forms of protest have declined to the feelings of political frustration of citizens, and they have been displaced to a second institutional level or suffered a systematic disarticulation. We propose the conceptualization of the contemporary social movement as a collective space built on a strategy aimed at a specific political system that performs change actions focused on <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> processes and sets out long-term objectives that have been agreed upon.</p>

<p>Science – research transformation of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things (IoT) has a number of colours and shadows, many dimensions including technical, social, community, financial, economic and civilization. This transformation has many wide development roads but also numerable pitfalls and traps. It does not take place solely at the level of scientific and technical progress and innovation. It preliminarily takes place in a complex socio-political-economic context, narrowed for simplification as social acceptance and education only. Such acceptance, for example expressed simply by demand and market popularity, for simple items supplemented by useful functions, such as an iron that recognizes the type of fabric and matches its work accordingly, a completely autonomous vacuum cleaner, etc., is trivial. We aim at much deeper relations of IoT with society. If IoT were only adding such functionalities, it would not be worth the time to consider it here. IoT causes a lot of confusion for much more important reasons in many areas of life. Somewhere further on the potential paths of IoT development, it has been noted with interest, but also with anxiety, the possibility of its empowerment as local but also global, superintendent surveillance system, gathering enormous amounts of information, creating knowledge and making autonomous decisions. Potential subjectivity must include such attributes as acquiting from the creator, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, consciousness, morality and further building by the society the whole legal system around the new entity. It will not be a single entity, it will be a whole virtual society, with electronic people. The consequences can be far-reaching and appear as an inevitable option on such a scale for the first time in the history of our human society. Overcoming certain barriers recognized by us may mean that the intelligence and consciousness are not only attributes of the human biological mind. Such reasoning, not without a reason, encounters strong resistance. However, there is a fundamental difference between the opposition to some genetic research and the potential modification of man himself, and the opposition to machine building, a system of superintendence that far exceeds the possibilities of a single man and of entire societies.</p>

<p>This article considers the way certain Indigenous artists are reviving conceptions of territory and history that are anchored in secular epistemologies and the construction of knowledge. Such conceptions provide a way for these artists to respond to colonial appropriation, reactivate interrupted dialogues, engender new forms of territorialization, and create places of commemoration and memory preservation. Similar to the historiographical deconstruction performed by thinkers and activists such as Vine Deloria Jr.&nbsp;and Taiaiake Alfred, these artists’ works offer a model of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and environmental balance. While some are reviving mnemonic practices, such as the making of wampum, which traditionally preserve memories of alliances and conflicts, others have embraced <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and selfie technologies as a means of creating new spaces for speech and recognition.</p>
