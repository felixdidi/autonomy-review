<p>Non-technical Summary Nations across the world are concerned with environmental issues like forest loss. The majority of nations acknowledge the importance of reducing forest loss, and make commitments to do so. However, researchers often find that despite these commitments, and the work of non-governmental organizations, in many nations, forest loss is not declining. This research argues that institutional capacity, specifically a nations domestic <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> may help explain the ineffectiveness of environmental international non-governmental organizations (EINGOs) at reducing forest loss. Specifically, I argue that nations with stronger domestic <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, measured as the extent to which a nation is free of the direct control of external political actors, improves the effectiveness of EINGOs at reaching their goals of reducing forest loss due to an autonomous state’s relative strength and ability to integrate their version of environmentalism or reinterpret existing norms of environmentalism into EINGO ideologies and activities. Technical Summary Previous research finds that environmental international non-governmental organizations (EINGOs) tend to have differential impacts on environmental factors cross-nationally, such as forest loss. More recent work argues that decoupling between stated environmental norms and actual environmental outcomes may be the result of a lack of institutional capacity. Using ordinary least squares regression for 91 low- and middle-income nations from 2001 to 2014, I find that EINGOs reduce forest loss more in nations with higher rather than lower levels of domestic <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. However, I find that EINGOs and domestic <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> on their own do not significantly predict forest loss. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social media</span> summary This research argues that a nations domestic <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> may help explain the ineffectiveness EINGOs at reducing forest loss.</p>

<p>In recent years, the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things paradigm has become pervasive in everyday life attracting the interest of the research community. Two of the most important challenges to be addressed concern the protection of smart objects and the need to guarantee them a great <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. For this purpose, the definition of trust and reputation mechanisms appears crucial. At the same time, several researchers have started to adopt a common distributed ledger, such as a Blockchain, for building advanced solutions in the IoT. However, due to the high dimensionality of this problem, enabling a trust and reputation mechanism by leveraging a Blockchain-based technology could give rise to several performance issues in the IoT. In this paper, we propose a two-tier Blockchain framework to increase the security and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of smart objects in the IoT by implementing a trust-based protection mechanism. In this framework, smart objects are suitably grouped into communities. To reduce the complexity of the solution, the first-tier Blockchain is local and is used only to record probing transactions performed to evaluate the trust of an object in another one of the same community or of a different community. Periodically, after a time window, these transactions are aggregated and the obtained values are stored in the second-tier Blockchain. Specifically, stored values are the reputation of each object inside its community and the trust of each community in the other ones of the framework. In this paper, we describe in detail our framework, its behavior, the security model associated with it and the tests carried out to evaluate its correctness and performance.</p>

<p>Immersed already in the 4th industrial revolution, clearly the digital age has invaded our lives. People tend to celebrate every technological and scientific advance without thinking properly about the possible undesired side effects or unexpected consequences. One of the most outstanding achievements of the last years has been the CRISPR/Cas9 technique. It seems to be the magic wand to solve whatever. In this article I propose to think critically about the ethical issues related to this incredible technique. I will focus this work on 3 ethical aspects of gene editing: 1. The link between gene editing and the old concept of eugenics; 2. Aspects related to the idea of modifying human genetics in order to conquer other planets and 3. The ethical implications of uploading all these data to the web. Finally, I suggest focusing on interdisciplinary ethical discussion, the dialogue between professionals, institutions and government which must ensure the protection of the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of patients and the safeguarding of their rights. To conclude, the suggestion of considering the role of Universities in ethical education of the future professionals with a practical rather than a theoretical approach is considered, with special attention to the integration of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netics in medicine.</p>

<p>This paper argues that the utopia of a borderless and interconnected <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>space loses its charm and the global <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> order is witnessing a territorial turn. The proliferation of the notion of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> sovereignty and its variances is a symptom reflecting sovereign states’ attempt to retain <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and control gradually eroded with the digitalisation of societies and economies. The sovereignty fever can be attributed to four reasons: political ambition, economic value, security concerns, and human rights. However, sovereignty is not the last word in debates concerning the future of digital society, for even liberal democracies have advanced ideas of technological or digital sovereignty, and data sovereignty, for their own very different purposes.</p>

<p>This study aims at exploring the influence of product design on customer engagement through self-determined needs satisfaction. This study used the survey method in three ways: (1) mall intercept approach, (2) <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> survey, and (3) survey through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Wechat</span>. The sample was collected from 500 customers of electronic products living in Xi’an, China. The data analysis is done through structural equation modeling. Findings show that perceived product design in terms of functional, esthetic, and symbolic design is positively related to self-determined needs (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, relatedness, competence) satisfaction. Furthermore, results reveal that self-determined needs satisfaction has a positive influence on customer engagement. The moderation results show that prevention focused customers moderate the relationship between functional design and self-determined needs satisfaction. Whereas, promotion focused customers moderate the relationship between esthetic design and self-determined needs satisfaction. This study adds value to the self-determination theory by examining the link between product design dimensions and customer engagement through self-determined needs satisfaction. Furthermore, this study adds value to the existing literature on regulatory focus theory.</p>

<p>Abstract International engagement has become a priority and is regarded as a means to improve the quality of students’ education and their future social and professional success. It may, however, pose a major challenge for some higher education students. One of the vulnerable groups is that of learners with special needs, and particularly Deaf, deaf and hard of hearing students. These learners are limited in their chances to interact in spoken/written foreign languages and in the learning opportunities they can join. This, by extension, has an unfavourable impact on their possibilities of engaging in study abroad. Based on the experience with a newly launched e-learning course “Online English for International Mobilities”, the present paper discusses the need for building effective FL learning strategies in Deaf, deaf and hard of hearing students in connection with the process of academic internationalisation. The main argument is for the need to foster students’ ability to self-regulate, reduce their teacher dependency and reliance on directed learning, and to encourage them to take responsibility for their own learning. Secondly, the paper provides a comparison of two pilot runs of the course from the perspective of (online) classroom dynamics and cooperation. While the course is built to be as autonomous as possible and benefits from the advantages of the e-learning format, great importance is given to group dynamics and cooperation via discussion forums and online <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>s. It also takes advantage of the considerable benefits of individualized, personalized feedback being provided by teachers on selected assignments.</p>

<p>Introduction. Vaccine hesitancy in parents is a composite of multiple dimensions such as confidence, complacency, and convenience. A large proportion of parents can be deemed vaccine hesitant, meaning that their vaccine behaviors can range from delaying vaccines, skipping select vaccines, to refusal of all vaccinations. Furthermore, parental vaccine uptake rates and patterns can reflect their decisions based on the balance of parental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> versus protecting population health. The current manuscript uses Social Network Theory to explain some of the external influences on parental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Social networks, both private and public, play a role in vaccine decision making through providing information and support for parents in their choices. This influence, in turn, is mediated by parents’ health literacy and local vaccination policy. Discussion. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social media</span> is an important type of public network that has an outsized influence on vaccine hesitancy. The rhetoric used on anti-vaccine websites often denigrates scientific evidence while at the same time endorsing poor-quality evidence that supports the anti-vaccine point of view. The websites continually propose new hypotheses of how vaccines can cause harm when studies refute their previous assertions, censor critics, and attack people with opposing viewpoints. The contentious nature of vaccine hesitancy based on beliefs, opinions, and attitudes needs a solution much deeper than simply providing factual knowledge or pointing people to reliable websites. Recommendations. Public health practitioners and researchers should try segmenting audiences, targeting private and public social networks, and then testing which persuasive strategies towards vaccinations appeal to different community groups.</p>

<p>E-learning has taken centre stage during this period of social distancing and lockdowns, in the current pandemic, by enabling education to continue. There are perceptibly no limitations to the utility of e-learning tools in the cognitive domain of learning. It complements traditional learning in other domains, namely, psychomotor, affective and communication skill, fairly well. Not only does it ease learning in terms of availability and accessibility, but with the options of asynchronous learning and personalisation of content, it also empowers learners with more <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Despite the limitation of lack of ‘hands-on’ training and experience with e-learning, it has been accepted quite well, although initially both teachers and learners had been skeptical about its applicability and quality. In the ongoing pandemic period, e-learning may assume a bigger role as blended learning in medical education. While this transition may be smooth for the better resourced nations who already have the required infrastructure and resources ready, the resource limited nations may first have to develop the same before being able to implement it. Ensuring the availability of cheap and high-speed <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>, computers in various forms (desktops, laptops, tablets and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s) within reach of every learner, will enable them to go online.</p>

<p>We explore the benefits and costs of social networking usage and examine the roles of need to belong and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to contextualize the fear of missing out (FoMO) socio-cultural phenomenon in the digital age. We utilize a self-determination theory-based framework for understanding how the FoMO phenomenon influences positive (negative) mood, information overload, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> satisfaction, and engagement with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> advertising. Study 1 explores how FoMO relates to positive mood through the need to belong. Study 2 demonstrates how FoMO impacts information overload through the mediation of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> interactivity. Furthermore, Study 2 shows how FoMO alters <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> satisfaction, and this relationship is mediated by information overload and moderated by <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Study 3 shows that negative emotions serve to mediate the effect of information overload on engagement with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> advertising. Finally, we discuss implications of this study to provide insight into how brand marketers can offer FoMO-reducing mechanisms to consumers to ensure a high level of advertising engagement, how health advocates can leverage <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> to promote meaningful engagement with consumers, and how industry practitioners may want to consider aspirational virtual events to create buzz while also satisfying consumers’ need to belong to social groups.</p>

<p>With the deep integration of “<span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> + education” and the continuous advancement of education reform, blended teaching has become the main method of university education reform. Blended education combines the advantages of traditional education and online education to complement each other. It not only takes advantage of the flexibility and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of online education but also retains the benefits of emotional communication between teachers and students in offline education. With the increase in practical exploration of blended teaching in universities, teaching evaluation is an important part of teaching, and blended teaching evaluation should also attract attention. The purpose of this paper is to study the mixed oral English teaching evaluation based on the mixed mode of SPOC and deep learning. On the basis of analyzing the teaching design principles of the mixed mode of SPOC and deep learning and the principles of constructing the teaching evaluation after half a semester of teaching investigations conducted by the two classes of English majors, the impact of the SPOC and deep learning mixed teaching mode on students’ spoken English was studied through the method of covariance analysis. The experimental results show that the mixed teaching mode of SPOC and deep learning has been able to fully stimulate students’ interest in oral English learning and improve students’ oral English ability, critical thinking of students, ability to solve problems, group cooperation, and effective communication. Self-directed learning and self-reflection have all had a positive impact.</p>

<p>Rapid advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) are transforming customer service by making it possible to create <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bot applications that can understand users’ intents and response in a human-like manner. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Chat</span>bots promise to enhance customer experiences by creating more personal customer interactions than those afforded by traditional menu-based web applications. But are <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots always superior to more traditional user interfaces (UI)? This study seeks to understand the differences in user satisfaction with a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bot system vis-a-vis a menu-based interface system, and identify factors that influence user satisfaction. Grounded in the self-determination theory, the research model proposed here focuses on the effect of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bot use on perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, perceived competence, cognitive load, performance satisfaction, and system satisfaction.

<p>This essay explores the intersection of communication and culture. It proposes that a new interdisciplinary field of inquiry–a phenomenology of communications–implicates culture in that all communication helps shape and reflects a society’s cultural assumptions and aspirations. In an era of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and electronic communication, the impact on culture has accelerated. Both positive and negative aspects of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> reverberate in American popular culture that Christopher Lasch described as a culture of narcissism and David Brooks calls a culture of the “Big Me.” The essay revisits a documentary about Mike Tyson’s life and career that exemplifies what it means to be an American, renewing a culture that aspires to redeem the American dream of a more perfect union beyond preference and prejudice. It shows also why American culture needs to be transformed from a narcissistic, self-referential, tribal perspective of identity politics and false tolerance toward a culture that respects individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and privacy, reconnects rights and responsibilities, and encourages true diversity, inspired by transcendent norms and ideals worthy of a creature created in the image and likeness of God.</p>

<p>This paper examined the impacts of participatory video used in digital training on the empowerment of sex-trafficking survivors in the Philippines. For survivors of online sexual exploitation involved in this study, technology played a critical role in their abuse, making it necessary to understand how technology-supported communication can also play in their recovery and personal development. Drawing upon the thematic analysis of data collected from debriefing, interviews, and participants-generated videos, the findings have shown that the participatory video as a tool to support communication, as a mirror for reflexivity and voicing, and as a mediated space to connect and gain support, affords a communicative platform for survivors to participate, to interact, and to take control of the technology. We argue that the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>y for empowerment is subject to the personalized needs, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and participation of the users .</p>

<p>Computational Thinking (CT) is considered one of the most needed abilities of the 21st Century as the usage of digital resources has become more and more frequent. Research on CT teaching has been growing over the last decade and Brazilian initiatives have focused on Elementary and High School students while less privileged audiences, such as non-literate citizens, are rarely addressed. The lack of literacy affects more than communication, but <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for economic, cultural and educational development, social interaction, and also the experience with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y. Non-literate citizens represent more than 11 million people in Brazil, and Youth and Adults Education (YAE) is an educational modality offered to these citizens. In this article, we present the main results from a Master’s research that investigated CT as a means to reduce YAE’s students’ rejection and fear of technology, aware of their characteristics, contexts, and particularities. In our research, we consider that through the practice of CT people can comprehend how technology works and how it can be used, favoring familiarity, and reducing rejection and fear of technology. Grounded on Computing and Education literature, we conceived a model to plan and conduct initiatives for YAE, applying and studying our model in a case study conducted inside a Brazilian public school during 8 workshops with 17 participants. For the case study, 9 principles to support the practice with YAE students were identified and used to inform 12 activities created/adapted for practicing CT throughout the workshops. A research overview is presented, along with its theoretical grounds to the main results from the case study and lessons learned. Results show the model as promising to inform practices to exercise CT abilities, sensitive to the audience’s context.</p>

<p>This paper analyzes the ethics behind the actions of the 2016 Data Scandal on the example of 2 major sides, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> and Cambridge Analytica. Subsequent events such as bankruptcy of Cambridge Analytica and a significant drop in the stock prices of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> (a fall of 24%, equivalent to $134 billion.) were an integral part of this research paper to explore the role of the attitudes of the business entities over bankruptcy in these kinds of scandals. Thereby, a comparison technique has been employed to analyze the ethical dimension of the bankruptcy of Cambridge Analytica, and how the attitude of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> provided a chance of survival and recovery within this process. The outcome of the research clearly identifies that even in the corporative entities bypassing or violating the ethical standards can be observed. Albeit, there is a strong correlation between the degree of ethical standards and the sustainability of the businesses from the aspect of customers, partners, and the government. The article continued with the analysis of the significance of the immediate implementation of the ethical standards and deterrent defense with a manner of “bona fide” in these types of scandals to handle the crisis. The research concluded with an ethical analysis of data analysis and data mining from the Kantian definition of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, Jurgen Habermas’s definition of privacy in the era of digitalization.</p>

<p>This phenomenological study explores how English language teachers become <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) literate and why they make use of ICT in English language class and find out challenges in integrating ICT in English language teaching (ELT). For this purpose, two secondary-level English teachers were selected purposively, and in-depth interviews were conducted to collect data. The collected data were analyzed using the thematic analysis technique. The findings drawn from the lived experience of the teachers reveal that teachers become ICT literate and updated by taking formal classes, training, and teaching their students; they make use of ICT in ELT for students’ language development, motivation, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The challenge of keeping the students on the right track is the major challenge English language teachers encounter while integrating ICT in ELT. Though there are challenges, every English language teacher should try to teach the English language integrating ICT.</p>

<p>Emotion-aware <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots that can sense human emotions are becoming increasingly prevalent. However, the exposition of emotions by emotion-aware <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots undermines human <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and users’ trust. One way to ensure <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is through the provision of control. Offering too much control, in turn, may increase users’ cognitive effort. To investigate the impact of control over emotion-aware <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots on <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, trust, and cognitive effort, as well as user behavior, we carried out an experimental study with 176 participants. The participants interacted with a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bot that provided emotional feedback and were additionally able to control different <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bot dimensions (e.g., timing, appearance, and behavior). Our findings show, first, that higher control levels increase <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and trust in emotion-aware <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots. Second, higher control levels do not significantly increase cognitive effort. Third, in our post hoc behavioral analysis, we identify four behavioral control strategies based on control feature usage timing, quantity, and cognitive effort. These findings shed light on the individual preferences of user control over emotion-aware <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots. Overall, our study contributes to the literature by showing the positive effect of control over emotion-aware <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots and by identifying four behavioral control strategies. With our findings, we also provide practical implications for future design of emotion-aware <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots. • In this study, we investigated the effect of control over emotion-aware <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots. • Rising ability to control emotion-aware <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots increases user <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and trust. • At the same time, a higher level of control does not increase cognitive effort. • Analyzing users’ control behavior, we identified four distinct control strategies. • Users can be categorized as Soloists, Kickstarter, Controller, and Undecideds.</p>

<p>Abstract Almost every aspect of a person’s daily life is affected by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICTs), and some unfavorable outcomes such as technostress have been noticed. In this study, we examine how technostress affects knowledge hiding. Drawing from the energy-consuming characteristic of technostress and prior research on how technostress affects ICT users, this article builds and tests a model that takes work exhaustion as a mediator and explores the moderating role of job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. To test our conceptual model, we examined the responses to a survey questionnaire submitted by 287 ICT users from multiple organizations. Using structural equation modeling, we found that technostress increases employees’ knowledge hiding behavior, and work exhaustion partially mediates technostress and knowledge hiding, while job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> only moderates the relationship between technostress and work exhaustion when the fourth factor of technostress, viz., techno-insecurity, is excluded. We also discuss future research directions and implications of the results.</p>

<p>Nurses are assigned a key role in pandemic response, with work engagement considered to be pivotal. The job demands-resources theory assumes that work engagement depends on job resources and job demands. Key job resources and demands have already been proposed for nurses. However, there is no evidence on their importance under pandemic conditions. Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate their relevance to nurses’ work engagement during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.The study was carried out in a cross-sectional design and addressed nurses in direct health care settings in Germany. Data was collected administering a quantitative online survey using valid and reliable measures during the second wave of the pandemic. A convenience sample was obtained, including the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, randomly selected health care facilities, and all universities with nursing-related programs in Germany. The dataset for analyses comprised a total of 1,027 cases. The sample included nurses of various educational levels and from different sectors. Multiple linear regression analysis after multiple imputation was used to examine the relevance of key resources and demands for work engagement.Key resources and demands explained 36% of the variance in nurses’ work engagement during the COVID-19 pandemic. Positive associations were found between the key resources of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (β¯SP=0.072, 95% CI [0.011; 0.133]), professional resources (β¯SP=0.204, 95% CI [0.124; 0.285]), and interpersonal relationships (β¯SP=0.178, 95% CI [0.117; 0.240]) and nurses’ work engagement. On the demands side, lack of formal rewards negatively (β¯SP=-0.312, 95% CI [-0.380; -0.245]) affected work engagement, whereas work overload (β¯SP=0.063, 95% CI [0.001; 0.126]) was positively associated with work engagement.The job demands-resources theory is suitable for explaining nurses’ work engagement even in times of crisis. Taken together, key resources and demands have a significant influence on nurses’ work engagement under pandemic conditions. However, not all so-called key resources and demands actually have a key status in a pandemic.Any lack of formal rewards should be countered, professional resources should be sustainably secured, and the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of nurses and their interpersonal relationships should be strengthened. Nursing management decisions should be made not only with the current pandemic but also the post-pandemic period in mind.</p>

<p>An understanding of the overall relationship between the work-related use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) and employees’ well-being is lacking as the rising number of studies has produced mixed results. We meta-analytically synthesize and integrate existing literature on the consequences of ICT use based on the job demands-resources model. By using meta-analytical structural equation modeling based on 63 independent studies ( N = 26,295), we shed light on the relationship between ICT use and employees’ well-being (operationalized as burnout and engagement) in a model that incorporates the mediating role of ICT-related resources and demands. Results show that ICT use is opposingly related to burnout and engagement through <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, availability, and work-life conflict. Our study brings clarity into the contradictory results and highlights the importance of a simultaneous consideration of both positive and negative effects for a comprehensive understanding of the relationship. We further show that the time of use and managerial position, and methodological moderators can clarify heterogeneity in previous results.</p>

<p>In recent times gamification has increasingly been used by brands through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s to interact effectively with their consumers. The core assumption for creating gamified environment is that it will develop engagement with the consumer and motivate them to use their product or services. However, beyond this assumption, there is dearth empirical evidence regarding how much effective these gamified features are in engaging consumers. Therefore, this research analyses the relationship between flow, brand engagement, self-brand connection and brand usage intent among consumers (N = 360)of two gamified mobile applications. The findings show that the multidimensional construct flow formed by five dimensions i.e.&nbsp;challenge, feedback, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, immersion, and interaction positively associates with cognitive brand engagement and emotional brand engagement. Additionally, both these forms of brand engagement further strengthen consumers’ brand connection and motivate them for further use. These results imply that gamified environment can augment consumer engagement with brand and further increase usage intention. Therefore, gamification can be an effective technique in brand management and brand managers can use it to strengthen relationship with consumers and increasing possibility of using their brands.</p>

<p>This paper explores paradoxical tensions and their management in modular solution networks on digital platforms. A case study approach was adopted to examine how two firms in the lighting facility and ICT industries use digital platforms to coordinate their diverse, large and dynamic modular solution networks. Our findings reveal that due to contradictory goals in offering diverse customized solutions, solution providers with digital platforms are facing several paradoxical tensions between flexibility and efficiency, control and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and standardization and customization. We find that solution providers cope with these paradoxes through implementing two simultaneous mechanisms: unification and diversification. While the diversification mechanism aims at increasing variety among modules and module providers, unification focuses on forming similarities among them. These mechanisms are made possible through digital platform features, such as algorithms, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>ies and platform access. This study contributes to the B2B literature by highlighting the nested nature of paradoxical tensions in the context of modular solution networks and by identifying mechanisms for managing these paradoxes. It also offers practical tools to solution providers to identify and manage paradoxical tensions in platform-based modular solution networks. • This study reveals three types of paradoxes in platform-based solution networks. • These paradoxes can be managed by unification and diversification mechanisms. • These mechanisms are made possible through digital platform features. • The study also offers practical tools to identify and manage these paradoxes.</p>

<p>New educational technologies offer the potential to affect service to all learners, but especially adult learners. Because of this fact, adult educators have become enamored by the possibilities offered through the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, distance education, and computers in general. Recently, Adult Learning covered this topic several times. Key research trends deal with the following issues: How much do the new technologies improve access to adult education? Are they as good, in terms of learning outcomes, as more traditional approaches? Are they better than traditional approaches? Are they appropriate for certain groups and not others? If so, what are the parameters of these differences? Are some groups excluded by the heightened emphasis on learning via distance and/or by computer? What are the policy implications of these findings? This column begins an examination of the meaning of new technologies both to educators and the general public. At every turn, there are those who hailed technological breakthroughs as the ultimate panacea; the point at which access will finally be opened and the hurdles to learning will evaporate. It is useful to remember that the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and computers are part of a long chain of innovations that have simultaneously promised diffusion and the possibility of interaction. Of course, the first in this chain of diffusion was the printing press, followed by the lending library, which was not a technological innovation. The lending library is still viewed as a democratic invention that encourages the spread of knowledge. Andrew Carnegie, whose Corporation would later be so instrumental in funding organized adult education, had as his primary philanthropic mission the establishment of public libraries. In terms of modern efforts at technology and diffusion, the telephone at one time was hailed as a new educational invention, followed by movies, radio, and television. All offered the potential of allowing people to continue their learning in a convenient fashion, with the possibility of immediate access. The library, nonetheless, preceded all of these. While each provide important sources of diffusion, none live up to the promise of diffusing information to every corner of society. Yet the dream continues. Those writing about the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> emphasize the possibility it offers for immediate access to information. The new wrinkle, of course is the opportunity for immediate feedback and discussion, which earlier innovations did not possess. This is not quite true, however, since back in the nineteenth century, the telephone possessed the same potential. While all of education is subject to fads, it seems that adult education has more than its share. This is probably due to adult education’s lack of an organized structure with its’ built-in system of control. As many writers indicate, this allows for greater flexibility, but it also precludes the development of a coherent vision. A field without a sense of vision cannot really develop, it merely spurts ahead in many different directions. What, then is the vision presented by the new technologies? This vision is quite simple and embodies principles that define efforts at adult education and diffusion for over one hundred years. They present the possibility of education on demand. The dream is that when computers become the norm, people will be able to access information from all over the world. This is the notion that somehow the wires of technology will replace the older traditions that connected people to each other. …</p>

<p>This paper is addressed to the study of the process of public policy, its evolutionary aspects and applications. The term policy has come to be used in different ways in public administration and business management orientations. Administrators, for instance use policy in its original sense to mean a course of action formulated by a collective constituency, or a legislative body.On the other hand, the management people, especially, in India use the term ‘policy’ rather mechanistically, (and imprecisely) to mean merely a set of guidelines which may be used to formulate an official course of action. This latter interpretation, often, negates the basic principle that a policy must evolve out of the ‘pol’ (a collective in Greek, equivalent to ‘palli’ in Dravidian) and must continue to be anchored in the collective forms of rationality. Such an anchorage would justify the requirements of legitimacy, sovereignty, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and hierarchy, in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netics of decision-making.</p>

<p>AbstractIn the present article various aspects of higher education challenges in Iran are discussed with keeping an eye on curricula and pedagogical practices from the Islamic perspective. It is clearly argued that Longstanding Problems such as faculty quality, Problems Faced by Students and Insufficient Resources and <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> are the most significant challenges of higher education in Iran. New Realities resulted from new revolutions such as the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and distance learning are also playing vital role in shaping the new higher education era in Iran.IntroductionToday, global wealth is concentrated less and less in factories, land, tools, and machinery. The knowledge, skills, and resourcefulness of people are increasingly critical to the world economy. Human capital in the United States is now estimated to be at least three times more important than physical capital. A century ago, this would not have been the case (Emily Hannun &amp; Claudia Buchmann, 2003). The developed world is reacting quickly, with education a major political priority. High-quality human capital is developed in high-quality education systems, with tertiary education providing the advanced skills that command a premium in today’s workplace (College Board, 2004).Most developed countries have seen a substantial rise in the proportion of their young people receiving higher education. Lifelong learning is also being used to help workers adjust to rapidly changing economies (International Comparisons of 4-year College Continuation Rates, 2001). During the past two or three decades, however, attention has focused on primary education, especially for girls. This has led to a neglect of secondary and tertiary education, with higher education in a perilous state in many, if not most, developing countries. With a few notable exceptions, it is underfunded by governments and donors. As a result, quality is low and often deteriorating, while access remains limited. Higher education institutions (and whole systems) are politicized, poorly regulated, and sometimes corrupt (Burton Bollag, 2004).We believe that a more balanced approach to education at all levels is needed. The focus on primary education is important, but an approach that pursues primary education alone will leave societies dangerously unprepared for survival in tomorrow’s world. We live in a period of major structural change. The classic industrial revolution that started in the United Kingdom at the end of the eighteenth century spread gradually and unevenly to Europe and beyond (United Joint Economic Committee States Congress, 2000). By the end of the twentieth century, a number of so-called follower countries had joined the ranks of industrial nations, and today industrial countries are found throughout the world. Some have narrowed, and even closed, the gap between rich and poor, with the East Asian countries being a good example. Average incomes have tended to increase across the world (except in Sub-Saharan Africa) in the past 20 years, although one-quarter of the world’s population still lives in abject poverty. Advances in information technology, meanwhile, have made this ever-increasing volume of knowledge more accessible, effective, and powerful. Networked computers and new forms of telecommunications spread information around the world with dazzling speed (Steven J. Rosenstone &amp; John Mark Hansen, 2003).The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, in particular, means that more knowledge than ever is in circulation. Those who have the skills to use it have access to an extraordinarily valuable (and sustainable) resource (Emily Hannun &amp; Claudia Buchmann, 2004).Longstanding Problems and New Realities Faculty QualityA well-qualified and highly motivated faculty is critical to the quality of higher education institutions. Unfortunately, even at flagship universities in developing countries, many faculty members have little, if any, graduate-level training. This limits the level of knowledge imparted to students and restricts the students’ ability to access existing knowledge and generate new ideas (Heath A. …</p>

<p>The article focuses on studying the modern trends of digital transformation of the management system of institutions of additional education of schoolchildren. Theoretical and methodological provisions have been scientifically substantiated and practical recommendations have been developed to improve the management system of additional education of schoolchildren in the context of digital transformations. It is proved that the institution of extracurricular education is also a community characterized by dedication, formal and informal structures, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, cyclicality, freedom of choice of extracurricular activities. For the first time it was proposed to use a system-<span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netic approach to the strategic management of institutions of additional education of schoolchildren based on the procedural model of strategic management and the information management system, tested in the management system of Russian Childrenʼs Center “Ocean”. It is proved that Management Information Systems (MIS) uses the information necessary for top managers at all levels in making operational, tactical and strategic decisions. The advantages and positive factors for institutions of the sphere of additional education of schoolchildren from the introduction of MIS within the boundaries of the procedural model of strategic management are highlighted. The characteristic features of the management activities of the subjects of management of institutions of additional education of schoolchildren are outlined. There are presented the management models, the knowledge of which will provide the heads of organizations of extracurricular education with data on selecting MIS. The importance of further development of the theory, methodology and practice in the strategic management of additional education of schoolchildren in the context of digital transformations has been proved.</p>

<p>The article is devoted to the formation features of the civic consciousness among the youth in mass culture and media communications. Civil self-consciousness is represented through a system of personal values, a person’s ideas about himself as a citizen, as well as about the state and society where he belongs and in relation to which he is self-determined.
 The purpose of the article is to present how the youth consumes the mass culture products and socio-political media content in the context of the formation process of their civic consciousness. The design of an empirical study is based on the principles of a political and psychological approach. The empirical basis of the research is the materials of the All-Russian survey of the youth aged 18 to 30 years, conducted in 2020 using the formalized interview procedure (n = 1600) and the in-depth interview method (n = 200), as well as the materials of the expert survey (n = 20). The materials reveal attitudes of the youth to printed publications, television content, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> resources, film products, fiction, musical compositions, perception characteristics of the presented socio-political information. The character of media consumption among the youth is determined by the values of freedom and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, justice, truth and truthfulness, and trust in information sources that are significant for them. The lack of critical thinking skills necessary for processing and analyzing a huge array of information determines their primitive perception of the political, the inability to identify political plots and political problems presented in the works of mass culture, a high degree of reactivity to the appearance of various media products. The civic consciousness formation of the youth becomes “broken” and fragmented under the influence of the media space as a factor of political socialization.</p>

<p>Abstract The remarkable development of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICT), considering the rapidly aging global population, could eliminate the physical and mental burdens involved in caregiving and enhance the perceived dignity and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of older adults. However, the introduction of ICT in long-term care (LTC) in Japan has not yielded good results yet, and the social acceptance of ICT remains understudied. This study aimed to understand and examine people’s views on ICT use in LTC settings. An online vignette survey was conducted in August 2020, among community-dwelling persons between the ages of 40–89 years, throughout Japan. A set of four vignettes of different physical and cognitive functional situations, at either a home or nursing home, with or without ICT use, was presented to select a preferred care setting. Multinomial regression analyses were used to examine the relationships between participants’ choices and individual characteristics. A total of 4,457 participants (52.8% of whom were women) were analyzed (mean age = 60.8 years). Participants were more likely to choose nursing homes in cognitively dependent situations. Participants who were women, relatively younger, and had higher education were more likely to choose care settings employing ICT for physically and cognitively dependent situations. Those who experienced either informal or formal caregiving were more likely to choose care settings that used ICT. This study revealed that individuals preferred different levels of ICT use based on physical and cognitive situations. Barriers to introducing ICT in LTC settings will be discussed.</p>

<p>My forthcoming book (MIT Press), Virtually Amish, is an ethnographic study of the adoption, design and use of digital communication technologies among members of Old Order Amish communities. This paper explores a section of the book focusing on Amish strategies for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> management. These strategies are in place to protect Amish communities from perceived negative impacts of technologically mediated connectivity. Today it is increasingly common for the Amish to adopt computers, the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and mobile devices in calculated ways to remain competitive in business. Often the use of these devices blends into the personal sphere as well. This research is notable for its empirical observations that show shared values are key to determining patterns of technology use in Amish communities. Data was collected via semi-structured interviews with thought-leaders (business and religious leaders) in Indiana Amish settlements. Findings show that the Amish consider their own cultural, social, political and religious <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in deciding how to engage with a broader social and economic system as technologies are essential to the mediation of these relationships.</p>

<p>The implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies suggests significant impacts on production systems productivity and decision-making process improvements. However, many manufacturers have difficulty determining to what extent these various technologies can reinforce the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of teams and operational systems. This article addresses this issue by proposing a model describing different types of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and the contribution of 4.0 technologies in the various steps of the decision-making processes. The model was confronted with a set of application cases from the literature. It emerges that new technologies’ improvements are significant from a decision-making point of view and may eventually favor implementing new modes of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Decision-makers can rely on the proposed model to better understand the opportunities linked to the fusion of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netic, physical, and social spaces made possible by Industry 4.0.</p>

<p>Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted older adult’s health and well-being worldwide. We explored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on daily activities and mental health and its relationship with cognitive performance in older adults. Methods One-hundred individuals 60 years and older, without cognitive impairment and enrolled in the Brazilian Memory Study (BRAMS), a longitudinal study, were applied the UCLA Loneliness Scale, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Participants were asked whether they had changes in daily routine and social connectedness during the pandemic. Results Almost half of the participants (48.4%) reported that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected their lives, 38.9% lost a relative or friend because of COVID-19, and 60% had daily routine changes. Relationships (40.5%) and emotion (22%) were reported as the most impacted area. Stopping physical activities and stay at home represented the main routine changed for 78% of participants. The use of voice messages through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s to maintain social connectedness increased from 24.2% to 42.1%. For 38% of participants, their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to daily decisions decreased, and 40% complained that memory got worse during the pandemic. More than 30% felt more stress, loneliness, or depression than in the pre-pandemic period. Controlling for age, sex, and education, higher loneliness scores were significantly associated with low MMES scores (p = 0.018). Conclusion Significant changes in life, daily routine, social connectedness, and mental health-related to the COVID-19 pandemic were reported by older adult participants. Loneliness was associated with lower cognitive performance.</p>

<p>Although the research results of mobile teaching mode at home and abroad have been involved in all aspects of education and teaching and provided a lot of useful reference for subsequent researchers, the lack of research on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">WeChat</span> interactive translation teaching mode makes the practical research in this field urgent. As China’s education industry continues to pursue international development, it is necessary to train a large number of international talents who have an international perspective, are familiar with international rules, and can participate in international affairs and international competition. However, to become an international talent, you must first have superior English communication skills and be able to deal with various international situations proficiently. The English education goals at the basic education stage are simply beyond reach and can only be cultivated through professional and systematic college English courses. This shows that college English education is at a crucial position in the future development of education. This study attempts to explore how to apply the interactive teaching mode supported by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">WeChat</span> network platform in translation teaching and English learning of high school students, so as to improve students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in translation practice, promote students’ personalized learning, and improve students’ interest and ability in English learning. Based on the investigation of a senior high school in our city, the school began to implement the interactive translation mobile teaching mode based on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">WeChat</span> in September 2018. The experiment selected the change of students’ English learning achievements in a certain semester and judged whether the mobile teaching mode was conducive to the improvement of learning performance based on t-test. We also need to collect the needs of teachers and parents for the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">WeChat</span> based mobile teaching mode and judge whether the mode can be promoted. The experimental results show that this teaching mode has an obvious effect on the improvement of students’ English scores, especially in the eighth grade, whose scores have increased from 72.6 to 75. Through the construction of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">WeChat</span> based interactive translation mobile teaching mode, parents can fully understand the key points of English learning and make English tutoring more targeted and timely. This teaching mode is worthy of promotion in senior high school English course learning.</p>

<p>Purpose The aim of this study is to diagnose the Egyptian political system from the perspective of the viable system model (VSM). That in turn gives us significant insights on how to improve the distribution and control of power in Egypt to warrant greater <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and representativeness in the branches of government. Design/methodology/approach The proposed diagnostic framework in this study was accomplished by applying the principles and aspects of Stafford Beer’s VSM to the three state powers of Egypt: the executive, legislative and judiciary. In addition, it adopts the guidelines for applying the VSM described by both Stafford Beer and José Pérez Ríos. Findings The presented framework in this study shows a comprehensive explanation of the essential functions and their distribution among the entities of the Egyptian political system. In addition to that, the findings give us insights about the need for greater <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and self-organization among the political system’s entities. Greater communication, consensus, cooperation and coordination is needed to achieve balance, regulate the interactions between them and to monitor each other without intervention. This, in turn, would ensure greater representation of citizen demands and expectations, and protect and guarantee their rights and freedoms. Originality/value The modeling of the Egyptian political system from a VSM perspective suggests the necessity of reform of the political system by a clear division of functions and tasks within the operational entities and subentities, decentralization of power structures and utilization of the decision marketing mechanism to reach public acceptance. The application of the VSM, for the sake of diagnosing and designing the viability of separation of power, can be considered as highly original.</p>

<p>Objectives: This study investigated the impact of positive and negative parenting attitudes on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> dependency in children to examine the mediating effects of online-based leisure such as computer usage, game, and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> usage.Methods: Data of 714 children scoring above the top 30% of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> dependency among the children in 5th grade in elementary school were collected through the 2nd wave of the Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey (KCYPS 2018). Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was applied to analyze the mediating effects with the Bootstrapping method by SPSS 21.0 and AMOS 20.0.Results: In the model, online-based leisure significantly mediated the relationship between positive parenting attitudes such as warmth, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support and structure provision, and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> dependency showing complete mediation. Also, negative parenting attitudes such as rejection, coercion, and chaos directly negatively affected <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> dependency, not showing a mediating effect. Results indicate that increased positive parenting attitudes lead to reduced <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> dependency through decreasing online-based leisure, while negative parenting attitudes lead to increase dependence on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>.Conclusion: While positive parenting attitudes do not directly affect <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> dependency, they lead to a decrease in online-based leisure. Consequently, as online-based leisure lessens, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> dependency subsequently may also be diminished. In addition, although negative parenting attitudes have no mediating effect, they directly influence the growing <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> dependency. Results confirm that positive parenting mediate the effects of online-based activities in relation to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> dependency when parents provide the most structure, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support, and warmth to their children. Practical implications are discussed, and relevant interventions offered for children and parents.</p>

<p>Abstract For sub-Saharan women enrolled in a protocol for assisted reproductive technology (ART), the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s entails dual allegiance: toward the services of reproductive medicine and toward their transnational family. Indispensable for medically monitoring women’s reproductive bodies, the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> enters the process for producing female gametes and contributes to the gender asymmetry typical of biomedicalized procreation. It is also used to maintain contacts with transnational family members who, from a distance, obtrude in the woman’s reproductive life. The use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s extends biomedical power over the woman’s body into her everyday life and the normative power of her transnational family into reproduction. Paradoxically, the mobile telephone allows collateral relatives to support the woman seeking reproduction assistance while also “hypermedicalizing” the woman’s daily life. Also paradoxically, this everyday companion is conductive to individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> while also being used for new forms of surveillance and control. The data come from fieldwork conducted in the greater Paris area between 2011 and 2013 within a network of ART professionals and their patients.</p>

<p>Purpose Previous studies overemphasize the negative effects of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> usage (SMU) within organizations and underestimate its positive influences on employees’ behavior. This study attempts to link employees’ <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use at work to their creativity performance. Design/methodology/approach Based on the bounded generalized reciprocity theory and unbounded indirect reciprocity (UIR) theory, the authors developed a research model. To test the model, the authors collected a set of 172 paired data of organizations and employees from 31 knowledge-intensive enterprises in China to test the hypothesis. Findings This research found that the social, cognitive and hedonic uses of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> all directly affect employee creativity. Relational energy fully mediates the effects of the cognitive and hedonic usages on creativity. Moreover, job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> moderates the effects of the relationships among the social, cognitive and hedonic uses on employee creativity. Originality/value The conclusions not only enriched authors’ understanding of the effectiveness of interpersonal interaction but also extended the research boundary of the relationship between SMU and employee creativity.</p>

<p>In this article, we discuss some of our research with Local Area Networks (LAN) in the context of sound installations or musical performances. Our systems, built on top of Web technologies, enable novel possibilities of collective and collaborative interaction, in particular by simplifying public access to the artwork by presenting the work through the web browser of their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>/tablet. Additionally, such a technical framework can be extended with so-called nano-computers, microprocessors and sensors. The infrastructure is completely agnostic as to how many clients are attached, or how they connect, which means that if the work is available in a public space, groups of friends, or even informally organised flash mobs, may engage with the work and perform the contents of the work at any time, and if available over the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, at any place. More than the technical details, the specific artistic directions or the supposed <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the agents of our systems, this article focuses on how such ‘networks of devices’ interleave with the ‘network of humans’ composed of the people visiting the installation or participating in the concert. Indeed, we postulate that an important point in understanding and describing such proposals is to consider the relation between these two networks , the way they co-exist and entangle themselves through perception and action. To exemplify these ideas, we present a number of case studies, sound installations and concert works, very different in scope and artistic goal, and examine how this interaction is materialised from several standpoints.</p>

<p>Ride-hailing platforms such as Uber, an integral component in the global platform economy, are not only facilitating fluidity and so-called <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of labor; they are also creating an unfair working environment for workers. This phenomenon indicates the strength of a highly temporal and mobile capital, pitted against workers not just in Lagos but around the world. This article adopts James Scott’s notion of everyday resistance in exposing some of the hidden practices of platform drivers in Lagos. It finds that sabotaging and falsely complying through manipulating algorithms and gaming spaces for rewards are facilitated by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and communication networks, are deliberate, hidden practices to subvert algorithmic control. While Lagos is a unique case in the global South, examples from global North cities highlight some peculiarity. A robust qualitative methodology was conducted comprising semistructured interviews, focus group discussions, and participant observations from forty Uber and Bolt trips. Other primary data sources include driver forums, attending driver training sessions and listening to transport radio programs. This article identifies temporal and spatial dynamics in recognizing everyday hidden practices as not always hidden, but dispersed and inconsistent because of the mutual learning capabilities between platform drivers and algorithmic managers. The hidden transcripts of platform drivers delve into public realms and back following, enabling platform drivers to develop new hidden practices, typifying a continuous power struggle in Lagos.</p>

<p>The specificity of contemporary daily life is manifested in the interaction of mass culture with new media forms. Such interactions cause many social and cultural problems, one of which is marital well-being. The paper aims at studying the potential impact of digital space and social networks on marital relationship. The methodological basis of the study is a systematic approach to the study of social objects, interpretive research paradigm, multidisciplinary analysis. Information base of the research are monographs, articles, conference proceedings, reports, blogs. The search was conducted using the following keywords: mass culture, social networks, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, digital space, marital relationship, mental health, psychological well-being, marital satisfaction. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social media</span> offers a diverse experience for each user. The researchers state that this experience is largely positive that explains the growing use of social networks around the world. However, the use of social networks has its significant drawbacks and can threaten marital harmony. Danger factors are information that can arouse suspicion and uncertainty in a relationship; excessive control over partners in social networks, which destroys the sense of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and privacy; excessive time spent in networks and intrusive signs of their use; disclosure of private information; insufficient privacy control; online adulteries that can cause divorce; feelings of worthlessness and dissatisfaction, which often arise as a result of comparing the personal offline reality with the online reality of the actors of communication processes and leads to frustration and depression.</p>

<p>• Immersive and interactive <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-physical system (I 2 CPS) framework for collaboration between human, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and physical systems. • Middleware and data-to-operation protocol were combined to communicate information with the wide range of contexts. • A new interface with virtual reality to provide the collaborative environment for augmenting human skills and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Smart manufacturing promotes the demand of new interfaces for communication with autonomies such as big data analysis, digital twin, and self-decisive control. Collaboration between human and the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> becomes imperative factor for improving productivity. However, current human-machine interfaces (HMI) such as 2D screens or panels require human knowledge of process and long-term experience to operate, which is not intuitive for beginning workers or is designed to work with the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. This study proposes a human interface framework of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-physical system (CPS) based on virtual reality, named as immersive and interactive CPS (I 2 CPS), to create an interface for human-machine-<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> collaboration. By combination of data-to-information protocol and middleware, MTConnect and Robot Operating System (ROS), heterogeneous physical systems were integrated with virtual assets such as digital models, digital shadows, and virtual traces of human works in the virtual reality (VR) based interface. All the physical and virtual assets were integrated in the interface that human, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and physical system can collaborate. Applying constraints in the VR interface and deploying virtual human works to industrial robots were demonstrated to verify the effectiveness of the I 2 CPS framework, showing collaboration between human and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>: augmentation of human skills by <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and virtual robot teaching to generate automatic robot programs.</p>

<p>Introduction. According to the well-established opinion of specialists in social sciences and humanities, a person diffracts his selves in the modern world: real spaces (professions, statuses) and virtual (accounts, profiles). In the diffraction of a person through spaces of different order, each “new” self acquires relative <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (a trace of the self in the network, which is present regardless of the attitude to it), and at the same time there remains the connection that, as it were, keeps the self with his digital images and “prints”. The main questions of the article are: in what relation and in relation to what is it possible to talk about the identity of a modern person; what fundamentally significant do the researches on human identity give us today; what do those who ask questions about personal identity in the digital age focus their attention on? In order to answer these questions, let us turn to scientific articles from domestic and foreign journals. This article presents the analytics of publications from Scopus and RSCI databases, in which the problem of personal identity is posed. The purpose of the article is to analyze scientific publications on human identity and summarize the main ideas presented in those publications. Methods. The research is based on general scientific methods, analysis and synthesis, induction, deduction, and abstraction. The author analyzes scientific publications on the basis of the interpretation method and a systematic approach method. Content analysis was used as a method, but it was used within the scope of the purpose. The publications were selected on the basis of the authors’ research of various aspects of identity and the difference in interpreting the phenomenon. Results. Analysis of Scopus publications made it possible to assert that the problem of identity is moving out of the anthropological context and acquiring new technical and technological frameworks (for example, scholars are raising the problem of the digital data identity, digital identification in the context of online transactions). At the same time, the anthropological view of identity remains. It is found for instance in the context of narratives, texts of a person about self that are posted on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. In this context, the concept of “Person Life View” (M. Schechtman) is presented as a variant of a person’s holistic view of the self. The analysis of domestic publications makes it possible to conclude that representatives of social sciences and humanities in their research strive to overcome the dynamic view of a person (dissolving of identity or an absent self), are in search of models of “stability” of identity. Conclusion. Posing the question about the personal identity of a modern person, it seems that the border between the directly human (consciousness and body, for example) and the technical and technological (the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and the objective world) is becoming more and more destabilized every day. This predetermines the direction of the research. Contemporary scholars, who publish the results of their work in journals included in scientific databases, are faced not only with the problem of substantiating human identity as a theoretical concept that reflects the modern situation, but also with the problem of finding models in which a person is able to embody the idea of “stability” of identity in the everyday life.</p>

<p>The purpose of the present study was to see whether perception of parents and self-presentation can predict <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> Addiction. This study examined the perception of parents by an individual in the dimensions of warmth, involvement and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support for father and mother and self-presentation in the dimensions of ability- and attempt-to-act among a sample of 142 participants (male (68) and female (74)), age ranging from 18 to 32 years. Results indicated that overall, warmth, involvement and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support of both father and mother, respectively and ability- and attempt-to-act do contribute significantly for predicting <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> Addiction. However, specifically involvement of father correlates negatively to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction and warmth of father and attempt-to-act in self-presentation correlates positively to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> Addiction.</p>

<p>From its origins, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netics has based its desire on the concept of transverse nature, today transdisciplinary. Within its history, the breaking point is unquestionably Stafford Beer and the VMS applied in Salvador Allende’s government. Chile’s historical conditions and context undoubtedly allowed a series of conceptual emergencies that were not necessarily developed after the 1973 coup d’état. Beer’s design, as he claims, could serve both a socialist vision and a fascist command. This tells us that the tool depends on the hand of the administrator. On the other hand, good but insufficient attempts have been made in the field of biologies, such as the theory of autopoiesis and epistemological positions concerning the observer, which have not been able to add value to the VMS. The errors in the design of the VMS can be summarized as follows: confusion of interactions with relationships, confusing co-<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> with self-organization, confusion of centrism and centralities necessarily as central and establish isomorphisms in a mathematical system aiming at conceptual homologation. As is the case with Information and Entropy. This work shows that the VMS must obligatorily migrate to a Relational Viable system, whose bases are the relations of cooperation and reciprocity based on heterarchical structures for limited or scarce material energy resources. This is the basis of the socialist design which forces the economy to reduce the production of Non-Required Variety.</p>

<p>The pandemic that occurred this year created conditions that changed the activities of parents and children, the role of parents working outside the home often led to a lack of parental involvement in child development, especially the development of independence. The conditions of the Covid-19 pandemic have caused parents and children to be in one place at the same time. This study aims to determine the effect of parental involvement and maternal employment status on the independence of children aged 7-8 years in the Covid-19 pandemic situation. This quantitative research uses a comparative causal ex-post facto design, with groups of working mothers and groups of non-working mothers. The sample of each group was 60 people who were randomly selected. The findings of the study with the calculation of the two-way ANOVA test obtained the value of Fo = 4.616&gt; F table = 3.92 or with p-value = 0.034 &lt;α = 0.05, indicating that there is an interaction between parental involvement and maternal employment status on children’s independence, and Based on the results of hypothesis testing, there is no effect of parental involvement and mother’s work status on the independence of the child even though there are differences in the average results of children’s independence.

<p>The prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild neurocognitive disorder (mNCD) are steadily increasing in Canada. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICTs) in health represent an innovation to promote home care and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for people with various degrees of cognitive impairment. The objective of this study is to develop a web-based multicriteria decision support tool adapted to older adults with MCI or mNCD, their informal caregivers, and health care providers (HCPs) to support the development and implementation of ICTs adapted to the needs and preferences of people with cognitive impairments and their caregivers.We used a participatory research strategy to develop of a decision support tool for the use of ICTs focused on the needs of patients, their caregivers, and HCPs. Data collection consisted of semi-structured interviews with elderly people with MCI (N = 10) and caregivers of people with mNCD (N= 7) to explore their current knowledge and perceptions of various ICTs as well as their needs and preferences for such interventions and a focus group with HCPs to understand their perceptions of the needs of seniors with MCI and caregivers of people with mNCD.ICTs are seen as a beneficial solution to promote home care and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for people with cognitive disorders. ICTs provide a sense of security and peace of mind, especially for caregivers of people with mNCD. However, the complexity and high cost of ICTs as well as the lack of support appear to be major limits to their use. HCP recognize the value of e-Health but claim to lack reliable information and were therefore highly unsure to recommend its use.People suffering from cognitive disorders and their caregivers are generally open to technological developments and favour the use of ICTs. For health professionals, continuous training on ICTs would make them more comfortable to recommend them to patients and their families. Although the use of ICTs is promising for maintaining elderly people with cognitive disorders at home, our study shows that it will be necessary to find ways to make them accessible to promote their use.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) is key to educational development. This study explores the mechanism influencing the use of ICT on students’ science literacy. We utilized two-level hierarchical linear models and structural equation models to analyze data collected from the 2015 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) in China. Results indicate that student-level and school-level ICT factors, in particular ICT interest, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in using ICT, and ICT availability at school positively impact the development of students’ science literacy. Further, we found some notable interactions between school-level factors and student-level ICT variables. Moreover, there are structural relationships among ICT availability, ICT emotional perception, ICT learning usage behaviors, science self-efficacy, and science literacy. We also found that teacher-delivered science instruction has a negative moderating effect on ICT learning usage and science self-efficacy. These findings have important implications of how to integrate ICT in future science teaching practices.</p>

<p>With government and industry experiencing a critical shortage of trained <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security professionals, organisations are spearheading various training programs to cultivate <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security skills. With more people working from home and the existing <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security staff shortages, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>criminals are increasingly exploiting new and existing vulnerabilities by launching ubiquitous <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>attacks. This study focuses on how to close the gap in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security skills through interest cultivation and self-determined motivation. Our study shows that situational interest (SI) in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security along with situational motivational determinants (i.e., perceived learning <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and perceived relatedness) engendered self-determined motivation toward <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security training. Consequently, self-determined motivation facilitated actual learning behaviour. Meanwhile, individual interest in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security created positive moderating effects in the relationships between self-determination and its key antecedents (i.e., perceived relatedness and situational interest). Based on these findings, we provide research implications accordingly.</p>

<p>The widespread use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s, mobile devices, wearable technology, and the increase in time online has provided the opportunity to collect data about users continuously. Several sectors such as health, economy, and entertainment have benefitted from the digital traces left by users due to the tight interactions on digital platforms. Today, it is likely to determine and predict users’ moods, behavioral patterns, habits, and personality traits with the use of digital traces that are processed using artificial intelligence techniques. Such use of digital data offers new opportunities for mental health services. Today with this method, it is possible to obtain simultaneous data on the course of the psychological disorder and create a complete and more holistic picture of the disorder by accessing data that can not be obtained from self-report assessment techniques. This new approach, which is called digital phenotyping, can improve the objectivity in diagnosis. Studies have proven digital phenotyping’s potential to determine disorders’ recurrence risk and make psychometric predictions. The studies have indicated the promising future of digital phenotyping in mental health services since the initial discussions by Jain et al.&nbsp;in 2015. It is reported that digital phenotyping can be used to diagnose and follow certain mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia at an early stage. However, ethical concerns such as privacy, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, data security, and data confidentiality are among the critical issues surrounding the use of digital phenotyping. This paper includes essential information about the digital phenotyping method, discussions about the practical, legal and ethical concerns regarding the use of digital phenotyping in mental health services, and suggestions for future research.

<p>The health and education sectors have experienced rapid technological development. In this scenario, the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> technology has grown as an option for the expansion of continuing education (CE), as it allows professionals to develop educational activities with flexibility, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and convenience. E-learning has gained popularity and currently, thousands of online courses are being offered. However, studies of e-learning in professional training have presented only a few specific foci of study.to develop a comprehensive approach to understand both the experience and the complex scenario of the use of e-learning in the CE for pharmacists.Field research in 10 Brazilian states through interviews and focus groups with alumni of a CE e-learning specialization course for pharmacists in public health. Data analysis used the model of socio-technical systems and was based on a framework with the components Objectives, People, Processes, Culture, Technology, Infrastructure, and Scenario.The People and Culture components indicated the assimilation and normalization of technologies in the educational process. Although the infrastructure (technical and organizational) was deficient in some regions, the Technology component suggested that the characteristics of the course design, associated with the personal characteristics of the students, provided ways to overcome obstacles. The objectives of the use of distance education seem to be related to the possibility of greater accessibility and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The Processes component, in turn, revealed the burden that a e-learning course puts on the pharmacist.E-learning proved to be useful to enable and expand access to education, providing pharmacists with an opportunity for CE. On the other hand, e-learning contributes to the normalization of the precarious working conditions of pharmacists, attributing to individuals the sole responsibility for the CE even in an institutional CE program, which results in work overload.</p>

<p>&lt;p class=“AuthorInfo”&gt;In the modern society, the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> breaks through the restrictions on time and space and becomes a ubiquitous learning tool. Designing teaching activity for digital learning and flexibly applying technology tools are the key issues for current information technology integrated education. Interactive learning modules could be used in the classroom environment for effective learning. This study explored the effect of instructional modules for providing supplementary instruction in biology concepts. Interactive digital learning module was developed in order to assist students in biology learning. Interactive activities were considered in this study, include teacher – student interaction, student - student interaction, student - content interaction, and student - technology interaction. 180 students of Grade 11 in 6 classes at SMAN 2 Balige were selected as the research subjects. Three groups of students participated in biology learning course, (2 classes) using different modules were interactive digital module, digital module and text module. Goal of this research was to determine the impact of interactive digital learning module on students’ learning activity and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Quantitative results obtained by using questionnaire to understand the student’s learning activity and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Results showed student’s activities and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> who learned with interactive digital learning modules significantly different with students who learned using text learning modules. The use of interactive features increased the activity and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of learners and created the student-centered learning environment. Students under interactive multimedia instruction performed better than text module class. These findings suggested that learning activity and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of students in biology could be enhanced by multimedia instruction.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>Vision Based systems have become an integral part when it comes to autonomous driving. The autonomous industry has seen a made large progress in the perception of environment as a result of the improvements done towards vision based systems. As the industry moves up the ladder of automation, safety features are coming more and more into the focus. Different safety measurements have to be taken into consideration based on different driving situations. One of the major concerns of the highest level of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is to obtain the ability of understanding both internal and external situations. Most of the research made on vision based systems are focused on image processing and artificial intelligence systems like machine learning and deep learning. Due to the current generation of technology being the generation of “Connected World”, there is no lack of data any more. As a result of the introduction of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> of things, most of these connected devices are able to share and transfer data. Vision based techniques are techniques that are hugely depended on these vision based data.</p>

<p>The article considers what is a philosophy and its relation to education . The modern academic development of philosophy has questioned the theoretical basis of specific aspects of knowledge and human experience, including education. It is an active rather than a passive or descriptive discipline. Education is defined similarly as a process by which knowledge, skills (including collecting empirical evidence and reasoning from it), cultural norms, values, and beliefs are acquired. The development of the modern philosophy of education is considered with its emphasis on conceptual analysis. Education is philosophically the conscious development of maturity requiring capacity for both intellectual and economic <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Issues in the contemporary philosophy of education are then considered, particularly the challenges of post-modernism and post-truth for a philosophy of education in an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> world. It identifies the need for comparative philosophical perspectives other than Occidental ones and suggests philosophical anthropology and comparative education as potential guides. It concludes that although there is now no consensus on how a coherent contemporary philosophy of education may be developed, analysis of concepts, metaphysical reasoning, and ethics may still provide a basis for a coherent and defensible philosophy of education whatever the comparative cultural setting.</p>

<p>Background It is estimated that 5.4 million Americans have some form of dementia and these numbers are expected to rise in the coming decades, leading to an unprecedented demand for memory care housing and services. In searching for innovative options to create more <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and better quality of life in dementia care settings, repurposing existing structures, in particular vacant urban malls, may be one option for the large sites needed for the European model of dementia villages. These settings may become sustainable Dementia Friendly City Centers (DFCC), because in the case of enclosed mall construction, the internal infrastructure is in place for lighting, HVAC, with varied spatial configuration of public spaces. This presentation describes the community engagement research being conducted by a research team at a Midwestern university, laying groundwork for the DFCC model for centralized dementia programs, services and attached housing. An <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>y workshop was held with 50 participants from multiple stakeholder groups including architect, urban planners, landscape architects, memory care administrators, medical doctors, family caregivers, university professors and students and public health employees. 5 breakout sessions were held after the initiative was introduced to the participants with topics covered which included the themes of community revitalization, building sustainability, urban regreening, onsite housing and medical care and innovation and culture change in dementia care This presentation provides the qualitative data collected through the recorded breakout sessions and the participants agreed that the DFCC model is one opportunity to make life better not only for those with needs associated with dementia now, but also for ourselves in the future. Others saw education of future stakeholders about the value of this model of care as critical in transforming current hurdles into future opportunities.</p>

<p>Exemplified by regions of the Russian Far East, the article presents a view on the current state and problems of managing regional public expenditures, including the focus of public expenditure on regional development. The research is based on the data from expenditure commitments registries in 2019. A major share of budget expenditures is “compulsory” (pre-determined) expenditures, which have limited flexibility and cannot be redirected to different purposes. Under these circumstances, the ability of regional governments to vary the direction of budget spending and finance self-initiated expenditure commitments—in other words, to independently manage the composition of expenditures—is kept to a minimum, which implies low <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in managing expenditures. Most of the Russian Far Eastern regions’ government expenditures are aimed at supporting the current volume and quality of public services. The share of developmental expenditures is higher in regions having more budget resources (Sakhalin Oblast), and significantly lower in regions of the northern Far East (Magadan Oblast, Kam<span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>ka Krai, and Sakha Republic (Yakutia)), the latter having higher costs of supporting critical infrastructure under severe climate conditions. In the present situation, regional governments cannot be fully considered as key influencers managing the development of their territories, and only fill the role of executors and lobbying actors for acquiring financial support from the federal government. As a result, it is difficult to account for specific territorial circumstances and development potential, and the overall efficiency of government spending is decreased. In the authors’ opinion, the findings may be applicable to most regions in the Russian Federation.</p>

<p>Studies on humour in Nigeria have been extensively carried out from the perspectives of stand-up comedy and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">computer-mediated</span> communication. There is a dearth of scholarly enquiries on humour in situation comedies (sitcoms). This paper investigates humour in the interactions of characters in Jenifa’s Diary and Professor JohnBull, with a view to accounting for the manifestations of humour, the humour strategies deployed and the functions that the humorous utterances serve in the sitcoms. The work is situated in Culpeper’s Impoliteness Theory. Eight excerpts from the sitcoms were subjected to pragmatic analysis. Two discourse functions of amusing and castigating are discovered in the data. The former serves the function of facilitating discourse and changing presumed power and status, while the latter serves the function of maintaining one’s own space and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and demanding respect. Allusion, parody, retort, tease, banter and putdown are the humour techniques employed in the sitcoms. The study corroborates the claim of earlier studies that humour in every sphere of language use serves certain functions beyond the interactional need to create amusement.</p>

<p>The growing social gap between people of different generations has led to a greater interest in the study of intergenerational interactions. Digital technologies have become necessary for people of all ages to perform daily activities, increasingly including older people. The use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICTs) and virtual tools can provide older people with excellent opportunities to connect with other generations, improving their quality of life and well-being. The aim of this study was to examine the benefits, satisfaction, and limitations of intergenerational interactions generated by the use of virtual tools. The participants are subjects of any age and different social groups residing in Spain and have completed an online survey. The analysis of sociodemographic data of the respondents showed that there is a significant correlation between the use of social networks and all the variables analyzed, except for their level of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Most participants who participated in intergenerational virtual activities reported the benefits of their social participation, relationships, mood, mental health, and academic education. Moreover, most participants were quite or very satisfied with the person with whom they used the virtual tools, especially if the person was a friend, their partner, sibling, another relative, or colleague. Except for grandparents, people who participated in intergenerational virtual activities and who had no limitations or disabilities were more frequently reported by the participants. In conclusion, intergenerational interactions through the use of virtual tools can contribute to improving the social inclusion and relationships of all people involved.</p>

<p>This article is part of the extensive research of value characteristics of IT community and their potential for innovative development. In view of this, the author examines the problem of determination of the modern cultural situation and, as a result, deduction of the criterion that establishes what &amp;ldquo;modern&amp;rdquo; is. Based on the previously acquired conclusions (according to which, such criterion is the consideration of irreducible multiplicity, and the major risk is the loss of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> by individuals), the author aims to find the model of subjectivity that would be simultaneously multiple and autonomous. The search for the model that meets such criterion is carried out through referring to the control technologies developed within the framework of third-order <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netics. The novelty of this article consists in peculiarity of the approach towards solution of the set task: the question in the form and method of determination of modernity has been first raised and&amp;nbsp; solved within the framework of the Russian academic philosophical community at&amp;nbsp; the previous stage of research, which determines the relevance at the current stage as well. Comparison of the developments of Russian and foreign authors reveals the parallelism between the development of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netics and psychoanalysis; demonstrates the conceptual intersections of the third-order <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netics and schizoanalysis; establishes the conformity between the subjectivity of the individual and the type of organizations they are engaged in. The article offers the concept of &amp;ldquo;dividual&amp;rdquo; as a model suitable for solution of the set task. The conclusions is made that the existing potential of the IT community for modernization is neutralized in the context of transition towards the hierarchical structure of the organization.</p>

<p>In order to meet the increasingly complex expectations of customers, many companies must increase efficiency and agility. In this sense, Industry 4.0 technologies offer significant opportunities for improving both operational and decision-making processes. These developments make it possible to consider an increase in the level of operational systems and teams’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. However, the potential for strengthening the decision-making process by means of these new technologies remains unclear in the current literature. To fill this gap, a Delphi study using the Régnier Abacus technique was conducted with a representative panel of 24 experts. The novelty of this study was to identify and characterize the potential for enhancing the overall decision-making process with the main Industry 4.0 groups of technologies. Our results show that cloud computing appears as a backbone to enhance the entire decision-making process. However, certain technologies, such as IoT and simulation, have a strong potential for only specific steps within the decision-making process. This research also provides a first vision of the manager’s perspectives, expectations, and risks associated with implementing new modes of decision-making and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> supported by Industry 4.0 technologies.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:lightgreen">Mobile phone</span>s have evolved to allow individuals to easily access and disclose the private information of others to a seemingly infinite network. Notably, the permanent nature of mobile data has aided its path between individuals and the police, storing integral evidence for criminal investigations in the palms of peoples’ hands. Understanding cognitive factors that predict when an individual would choose to report mobile data to the police is pertinent, particularly in a time of heightened controversy over data access limits and ubiquitous surveillance. This study extends Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) through incorporating the watchful eye effect and the theory of contextual integrity to analyze predictors of intention to share data with the police. The results of a 2 (Situational severity: high or low) x 2 (Surveillance: present or absent) between-subjects factorial vignette methodology ( N = 222) revealed that participants behaved independently of feeling watched, but that such sharing can be causally attributed to situational severity. Further, we found PMT variables—including perceived severity, response-efficacy, self-efficacy, and response cost—as well as perception of the police to serve as predictors of intentions to share with the police, with some of these factors mediating the effects of situational severity and surveillance. This study not only provides a theoretical contribution to PMT but also practical recommendations for mobile design that considers surveillance normalization and prioritizes data <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. • High situational severity crimes causes a high intention to share data with police. • Individuals act independently of surveillance when sharing data with the police. • Results on PMT predictor variables align with that of previous literature. • PMT predictor variables mediate environmental factors and behavioral intention. • Perception of the police acts as a predictor of intention to share data with them.</p>

<p>The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of things (IoT) representing the online exchange of data from real devices is a major revolution that is transforming the whole of society. IoT has penetrated in the health field by facilitating healthcare exchanger for users and professionals. This article aims to examine several factors reinforcing user engagement. A theoretical framework was developed and includes the perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, the desire for self-development, and the user trust to predict IoT user engagement in the medical context. The partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) approach was conducted with a sample of 109 French users. The findings highlight the relationship between trust and engagement in the use of the IoT device to improve health behavior. This research is part of a long-term IoT customer/designer relationship based on interaction and trust. It can enable IoT providers, medical professionals, and marketers to optimize patient communication to target potential users more accurately and reduce user abandonment of devices.</p>

<p>Information ethics is a branch of applied ethics that focusses on web applications, information management, and the general use of computers. It is concerned with questions of a just and free distribution of information, with questions of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and power on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> or a value-oriented design of Information Technology (IT) systems. Information technologies shape many of the essential factors of interaction in a data-driven society. The implementation of values such as privacy, freedom from discrimination or participation in the development of a digital society is therefore a necessary prerequisite for a democratic and sustainable course of action. Digital information technologies make it possible to disseminate information in two ways: via the users, and about the users. Increasingly, information about the behavior and the communication of users can be collected through digital platforms. The vast amount of economically used data and also the exchange of information on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms calls for evaluation, orientation and governance. Only in this way can we ensure that freedom of information is not a privilege, but a shared resource in a lively pluralistic and democratic society.</p>

<p>Prior studies have shown that parent-adolescent relationships and peer relationships may be important factors associated with adolescent <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> addiction (MPA). The present study aims to further explore the direct effects of parent-adolescent and peer relationships on adolescent MPA as well as the indirect effects through the mediating roles of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness needs satisfaction.Our sample consisted of 1766 Chinese adolescents (53.10% male; Mage = 13.33, SD = 1.94, range from 10 to 18 years) who completed questionnaires regarding parent-adolescent relationships, peer relationships, psychological needs satisfaction, and MPA. SPSS 24.0 was used to analyze correlations among variables and Mplus 7.4 was used to test the structural equation model in this study.(1) positive parent-adolescent relationships were negatively associated with adolescent MPA, while peer relationships did not show a significant association with MPA; (2) <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and competence needs satisfaction significantly mediated the effects of parent-adolescent and peer relationships on MPA, while the mediating role of relatedness need satisfaction between parent-adolescent and peer relationships and MPA was not significant; (3) the mediating effect of competence need satisfaction between peer relationships and MPA was significantly stronger than that between parent-adolescent relationships and MPA.This study explored the different mechanisms by which parent-adolescent and peer relationships influence adolescent MPA. These discoveries may contribute to intervention and prevention programs for adolescent MPA.</p>

<p>Connectivity is key to the latest technologies propagating into everyday life. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span>-Physical Systems (CPS) and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>-of-Things (IoT) applications enable users, machines, and technologically enriched objects (‘Things’) to sense, communicate, and interact with their environment. Albeit making human beings’ lives more comfortable, these systems collect huge quantities of data that may affect human privacy and their digital sovereignty. Engaging in control over individuals by digital means, the data and the artefacts that process privacy-relevant data can be addressed by Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and its established instruments. In this paper, we discuss how the theory and its methodological knowledge can be considered for user-centric privacy management. We set the stage for studying motivational factors to improve user engagement in identifying privacy needs and preserving privacy when utilizing or aiming to adapt CPS or IoT applications according to their privacy needs. SDT considers user <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, self-perceived competence, and social relatedness relevant for human engagement. Embodying these factors into a Design Science-based CPS development framework could help to motivate users to articulate privacy needs and adopt <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-physical technologies for personal task accomplishment.</p>

Specifically, emerging adults’ communication patterns and the relationships among communication, well-being, and their perceptions of parents’ involvement and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support are explored. Emerging adults ( N = 328) reported their frequency of communication in person, over the phone, via text message, and on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s with mother, father, and closest friend. A Latent Profile Analysis revealed four communication patterns (Low communication, Friend-oriented, Parent-oriented, and Multimedia). Communication patterns with mothers and fathers were similar; youth used more text messaging and social networking with friends. A Friend-oriented communication pattern was associated with psychological well-being while the Multimedia group reported higher social well-being.</p>

<p>In light of the accelerated growth of an aging population , coupled with the massive diffusion of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies (ICTs), research on whether ICTs meet the needs of elderly users is important and timely. Despite the popularity of self-determination theory, few studies have adopted this theoretical framework to explain need satisfaction among this group. The continuous use of mobile government (m-government) relies on the satisfaction of citizens’ needs. Through the theoretical lens of self-determination theory, we developed a research model of m-government for elders’ intrinsic need satisfaction. In this model, the design factors, performance factors, and individuals’ ability factors are incorporated. Based on data from 366 m-government-for-elders users in China’s Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces, and through the use of structural equation modeling, the results show that complexity has a negative correlation with <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> need satisfaction and competence need satisfaction. Visual appeal positively affects all dimensions of intrinsic need satisfaction. Information quality has a positive relationship with relatedness need satisfaction. The effects of personalization on relatedness need satisfaction and the influence of personalization on competence need satisfaction were significant. Information literacy moderates the relationship between complexity and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> need satisfaction, as well as between complexity and competence need satisfaction. The findings of this article enrich existing m-government research and provide practical implications for policymakers and m-government developers in China. • The three basic intrinsic needs of seniors users are met by using m-government for elders. • Visual appeal of devices is the most salient driving factor of intrinsic need satisfaction. • We examine the moderating effect of information literacy. • The antecedents of three kinds of intrinsic need satisfaction are different.</p>

<p>This study examined the emergence of the phenomenon of hijra among millennials in Aceh, Indonesia, and how this phenomenon has changed the Islamic landscape. This study applied qualitative research methods while the data were collected through observation, in-depth interviews, and documentation. The research subjects consisted of 4 hijra community founders and 10 teenage members of 3 hijra communities in Langsa. These communities include Komunitas Generasi Rabbani (KGR), the Akhwat Ilmu Agama (AKHIA) and the Muslimah Aceh Fillah (MAF). This research integrated Michael Foucault’s theory of power and knowledge and Jurgen Habermas’s theory of public space. The findings of this study indicated that the phenomenon of hijra among them has implications for changes in the Islamic landscape. It was triggered by the rapid development of information technology, such as the use of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and content production on various digital platforms such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Instagram</span>, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span>, and YouTube. The impact of this phenomenon fosters the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the millennials to find their interpretations and choose new religious patrons that can be accessed easily through various existing digital platforms. The emergence of these new religious patrons does not come from traditional religious institutions like dayah. Such Islamic expression will expose young Muslims to pop culture and information technology in the future.</p>

<p>Use of online health information is positively associated with citizen knowledge, empowerment, self-care, health outcomes, and quality of life. However, little is known about how mothers with incomes below the poverty threshold and with education levels of high school or less use and interact with the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> as a key source of lay knowledge and skills for infant care and childrearing. Our objective in this study was to understand mothers’ perceptions of their experience in using online information for these purposes. To obtain a rich and nuanced understanding of their experience, we used a qualitative study approach based on 40 individual semi-structured interviews with mothers. Adopting Freidson’s concept of “lay referral system” to grasp mothers’ experience with online parenting information, we found that they relied on this information source extensively. Our findings showed that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>-based information and online interactions were part of their lay referral system and modified to some extent how they interacted with their lay consultants (family and friends). Three major themes emerged in relation to how the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> functioned as a component of the mothers’ lay referral systems: (1) strategic use of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> for better parenting; (2) critical stance towards the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>; and (3) strengthening of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, skills, and self-confidence. Mothers with spouses and an active social network were more likely to use online information to complement information obtained from their entourage or from professionals than were mothers with a less active social network or who were more socially isolated.</p>

<p>An exceptional chain of events in science, technology, art and planning took place in Latin America in the 1970s. Does this wonder shed light upon our view of the basic roots of cultural, social and political blooming? This paper intends to adduce evidence on second-order <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netics processes underlying five outstanding cases in real societies and to disclose the links between democracy and unfettering momentum for freedom and creativity. Namely, Oscar Varsavsky, national projects, styles of development, scientific and technological <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>; Stefano Varese, cultural and political <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of indigenous people; Mario Pedrosa, creation of the Museum of Solidarity in Chile; Stafford Beer, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span>syn project for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netics and self-management in Chile; and Humberto Maturana, concepts of autopoiesis, cognition, language and multiverse. The reasoning counts with the author’s direct participation in all cases. The paper sets a similarity worthy of being noticed between Allende’s Unidad Popular in Chile and Pericles’ Golden Age in Greece and outlines why these historic realms albeit far apart have lasting importance and similar historical impetus. Highlights the essential and seminal features of each stream and comes to the conclusion that effective democracy is the necessary condition for participation and creativity. Upsurges in social participation and creativity are neither frequent nor cyclical. Still, such sudden and usually large increase in ingenuity, flair and aim to improve living conditions, although limited in time, remain in our mind as a joy forever. Nowadays, the world witnesses a contrary motion towards sterile art patterns and restrained behaviour. Hence, it becomes even more important to better understand the basic roots of cultural, social and political blooming.</p>

<p>Abstract This paper proposes potential benefits of adopting Asian philosophies in considering the design of “<span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> civilization” governance. The West is currently struggling to balance the use of data for commercial purposes with the social good stemming from the protection of personal privacy and dignity. It is also grappling with the idea of machines having autonomous capabilities that human minds alone were supposed to monopolize. East Asia, with its tradition of Confucianism, Buddhism, and animism, has long emphasized the virtue of mutual benevolence as well as conviviality with nature, both of which may be contrasted with the Western emphasis on the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of individuals and the supremacy of humans over nature. We need to revisit such foundational schools of thought in view of such factors as network externalities of data, extremely low marginal cost of digital services, and high level of traceability, all of which are altering the historical prerequisites of the modern market economy. In the face of the emergence of a new civilization, we need to find a guiding philosophy which allows us to develop policies that adequately benefit all people. There are notions such as integrity (fiduciary responsibility) that East and West share and that may be adopted to build broadly acceptable governance principles.</p>

<p>Evolving <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) reshapes people’s reading activities by popularizing digital reading. Past studies focused on the relationships between students’ frequency of ICT use and reading performance but neglected the possible interrelationships between students’ ICT-related psychological factors, school contextual factors, and reading performance. This study applied the Self-determination Theory (SDT) to explore the relationships between students’ ICT-related psychological factors (perceived interest, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and social interaction in using ICT) and reading performance. The possible moderation effects of schools’ contextual variables (schools’ support in ICT devices and schools’ support in teachers’ capacity to integrate technology in teaching) were also investigated. Data from 222,293 secondary students from 10,103 schools in 47 economies who participated in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018 were analyzed using three-level hierarchical linear modeling. The results provided support for the SDT by confirming the positive correlations between students’ ICT-related interest, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and competence and reading performance, and the accentuating moderation effect of schools’ contextual factors. However, students’ perceived social interaction in ICT use was negatively correlated with reading performance, and this negative correlation worsened with increasing schools’ support in ICT devices while buffered with increasing schools’ support in teachers’ capacity to use technology.</p>

<p>Bullying and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying prevention remain a major priority for schools, communities, and families, and research is clear that positive, constructive parenting practices can play a key preventive role. The current work explores six dimensions of parenting (warmth, structure, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support, rejection, chaos, and coercion), and their specific relationship to school and online bullying. Using survey data from a nationally representative sample of 1474 English-speaking 12- to 17-year-old US youth, we found that students whose parent(s) exhibit warmth, structure, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support are less likely to have engaged in bullying or <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying offending, while those with parental relations marked by rejection, chaos, and coercion are more likely to have participated in both forms of peer aggression. Implications for developing stronger parent-child relationships through improved parenting practices as a mechanism for bullying prevention are discussed.</p>

<p>There was a time when military technology reinforced and provided added value and expertise to business and government organisations. There are a number of technologies, specific military applications and solutions such as the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, GPS or sunglasses, and methodologies like strategic planning and negotiation systems that were developed in the past within military domains and later evaluated and implemented, which brought increases in speed and added business value. There are now many diverse digital transformation projects being implemented in several business domains – ranging from small and medium businesses like an Italian family restaurant to the global oil and gas companies such as Shell or British Petroleum or even executive branches of the European Union/European Commission. All these organisations use different technologies to optimise processes, innovate faster, collaborate efficiently and deliver more value with less effort. Economic defence – like never before – means national security. For that reason, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span> Security initiatives associated with digital transformations include a “testing mode” period, along with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span> <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> functions that aim to support business critical infrastructures.

<p>Job and career satisfaction of early-career pharmacists and pharmaceutical scientists is imperative to ensure a motivated and effective workforce, and a secure future for pharmacy practice. In turn, this enables planning, deployment and long term implementation of global imperatives, through universal pharmacy coverage. This study used data from a global survey to determine the level of job and career satisfaction and identify factors that are most significant in determining satisfaction in early-career professionals. A cross-sectional survey was distributed to members of the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) Young Pharmacists Group (YPG) via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms from November 2019 to May 2020. A previously validated questionnaire using 5-point Likert scales was used. Data were analysed by exploratory factor analysis, using principal component analysis, oblique rotation, and reliability testing of identified components, followed by a comparative statistical analysis. A total of 1014 respondents from 92 countries participated in this study. Regions of domicile significantly affected job satisfaction ( p = 0.004) and career satisfaction ( p &lt; 0.0001) scores. Pharmacists working in community pharmacies perceived lower job satisfaction measures compared to those who work in academic institutions ( p &lt; 0.0001) and industry sector ( p = 0.012). There is a negative association between career expectations and job satisfaction and career satisfaction scores. The workplace climate is related to education and training opportunities, lower reported workloads, greater <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and more remuneration. This was an international study of early-career pharmacists and pharmaceutical scientists. Enhancing factors associated with job and career satisfaction is essential to support early-career pharmacists and pharmaceutical scientists in obtaining fulfilment and esteem in their chosen careers. Developing and implementing a well-framed system that provides a conducive working environment, remuneration, and greater <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> could improve job and career satisfaction. This study provides evidence to support investment in early-career training, stated in the FIP Development Goal 2.</p>

<p>Military technology is developing incredibly fast. Drones, Autonomous Weapon Systems (AWS), and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span>warfare instruments have been resorted to by states and non-state actors in warfare. Yet, the developments and emerging challenges have not resulted in formal amendments to the existing regulatory framework of International law. Some believe that the current regime is required to be amended in accordance with developing technologies. Others support the idea that the rules and principles of the existing International Humanitarian Law regime need to be re-evaluated and re-interpreted according to changing conditions on the ground that a formal amendment process does not seem to be a feasible option because of the resistance of the powerful international actors. At this point, formidable questions arise such as; What are the challenges to interpreting existing rules and standards of the IHL regime amidst the increasing developing technologies? What levels of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> will be permissible for AWS to ensure compliance with international law principles, i.e., the principle of distinction in warfare? Which technologies or certain weapons can/should be restricted and outlawed? This article aims to come up with satisfying answers to these and further questions.</p>

<p>Background: Respiratory care (RC) is a healthcare discipline that specializes in providing treatment for patients with acute and chronic cardiopulmonary abnormalities. Today, RC possesses a solid skill base and an expansive depth of knowledge, enabling them to provide safe, team-based, evidence-based effective care for patients. This study explores perceptions of RC students (RCS), RC faculty (RCF), and RC professionals (RCP) regarding Interprofessional Education (IPE) and Interprofessional Practice (IPP). Additionally, it identifies factors that affect perceptions of knowledge, skills, and abilities related to IPE and IPP among RCS, RCF, and RCP.
 Methods: A mixed method (embedded) design was used. An online <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> survey questionnaire was <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>ed to the program directors to distribute it among their students, alumni, and faculty. The total of 421 program directors were reached via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>. Three hundred forty-five surveys were returned, with 208 surveys eligible for analysis.
 Results: The findings showed a significant main effect of professional status on the Interdisciplinary Education Perception Scale (IEPS) overall score regardless of the IPE exposure. However, there was no significant difference in the average score on the competency and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, perceived need for cooperation, or perception of actual cooperation. Qualitatively, it was revealed that simulation was the most useful IPE experience for promoting IPP. Additional factors such as time, attitude, experiences, cooperation, and cost were believed to affect the infusion of IPE into the academic environment.
 Conclusion: Regardless of the status of RCS and RCPs exposure to IPE during their professional education, all perceived IPE as positively supporting IPP. Qualitatively, for those directly exposed to IPE, simulation was identified as the most useful IPE experience for promoting IPP.
 Recommendations: IPE should be continued implemented as a strategy for the promotion of IPP, as well as the necessity for further documentation and assessment of the IPE techniques used in the academy to guarantee learning outcome accountability.</p>

<p>The skill shortage in global <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security is a well-known problem; to overcome this issue, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> ranges have been developed. These ranges provide a platform for conducting <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security exercises; however, conducting such exercises is a complex process because they involve people with different skill sets for the scenario modeling, infrastructure preparation, dry run, execution, and evaluation. This process is very complex and inefficient in terms of time and resources. Moreover, the exercise infrastructure created in current <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> ranges does not reflect the dynamic environment of real-world systems and does not provide adaptability for changing requirements. To tackle these issues, we developed a system that can automate many tasks of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security exercise life cycle. We used model-driven approaches to (1) model the roles of the different teams present in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security exercises and (2) generate automation artifacts to execute their functions efficiently in an autonomous manner. By executing different team roles such as attackers and defenders, we can add friction in the environment, making it dynamic and realistic. We conducted case studies in the form of operational <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security exercises involving national-level <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security competitions and a university class setting in Norway to evaluate our developed system for its efficiency, adaptability, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and skill improvement of the exercise participants. In the right conditions, our proposed system could create a complex <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security exercise infrastructure involving 400 nodes with customized vulnerabilities, emulated attackers, defenders, and traffic generators under 40 minutes. It provided a realistic environment for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security exercises and positively affected the exercise participants’ skill sets.</p>

<p>Recently, Covid-19 has threatened the education sector and forced learners to adjust an online learning. According to that, learners need to study in their own space and make them more independent and autonomous. However, learners tend to experience difficulties caused by their surrounding environments that sometimes does not support online learning. Surrounding environments include human activities e.g., noise in the surrounding; financial capabilities of parents for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> data plans; or other issues beyond the student’s intellectual abilities. Therefore, this research aimed to explore the existed environmental factors that affected the learning environment and define the factors which affected learners’ volition. This study was applied a qualitative method and presenting the collected results descriptively. The researcher worked with one English teacher who has been voluntarily participating in this study. This study used semi-structured interview and questionnaire as the research instruments. Firstly, the researcher sent the questionnaires using Google Form for all students at 11th graders from one of the government-owned senior high schools in Surabaya. Secondly, the researcher interviewed an English teacher to find out the class’ conditions. This study has revealed that teacher still holds huge responsibilities to guide students along the online learning process. Besides, there were still a lacks IT skills of students which make the teacher not only a facilitator but also a helper or counsellor. This dominant role of the teacher eventually made students less autonomous.</p>

<p>The lack of consent or debriefing in online research has attracted widespread public distrust. How can designers create systems to earn and maintain public trust in large-scale online research? Procedural theories inform processes that enable individuals to make decisions about their participation. Substantive theories focus on the normative judgments that researchers and participants make about specific studies in context. Informed by these theories, we designed Bartleby, a system for debriefing participants and eliciting their views about studies that involved them. We evaluated this system by using it to debrief thousands of participants in a series of observational and experimental studies on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span> and Reddit. We find that Bartleby addresses procedural concerns by creating new opportunities for study participants to exercise <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. We also find that participants use Bartleby to contribute to substantive, value-driven conversations about participant voice and power. We conclude with a critical reflection on the strengths and limitations of reusable software to satisfy values from both procedural and substantive ethical theories.</p>

<p>The significance of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in today’s English Language Teaching (ELT) context has been well recognized and confirmed by many research findings; however, in some cases in which independent learning is not well established, the implementation may not be easy. Thus, this research is intended to provide data on teachers’ readiness and challenges in promoting learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> during online learning activities. This research employed quantitative and qualitative data collection. The quantitative data were gained by a survey that has been conducted to 38 English teachers in 38 junior high schools in Bengkulu. In addition, the qualitative data were collected from an interview that has also been carried out to six teachers. The quantitative data obtained were then analysed through descriptive statistics analysis in the form of percentages and frequency. Meanwhile, the qualitative data were analysed by using thematic analysis. The results showed that in general most teachers were ready to build learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in ICT-based English learning. Most teachers used various methods in online teaching, gave freedom for the students to access different online resources according to their interest, found it easy to carry out online learning, yet most of them did not prefer to implement online learning activities. In the implementation, some challenges were faced by teachers, including poor <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> connection, students’ different characteristics, and lack support from school policymakers.</p>

<p>Because of COVID-19, higher education changed as institutions went remote and students’ mental health was challenged. Rural universities were disproportionately affected because of limited <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> access. The purpose of this study was to investigate the psychological need satisfaction/frustration and mental health among rural college students during this pandemic.Six hundred ninety-eight students (Mage = 22.15 ± 2.55) at a rural South-eastern university were recruited.Participants completed a survey examining stress, anxiety, need satisfaction/frustration and previous experience with online courses.Anxiety, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and competence frustration were found to predict 60% of the variance of stress. Another regression analysis found stress, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness frustration to predict 70% of the anxiety variance.Students are frustrated due to the lack of control and restrictions affecting their social interaction. Understanding the relationship between need satisfaction/frustration and mental health can aid university administration in developing interventions that address rural students’ needs.</p>

<p>The development of the literature on teacher leadership in the academic realm has been exponential, but the quest for more leadership knowledge seems to be inexhaustible. The purpose of this paper is to analyze teachers’ perceptions with respect to their leadership abilities. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Email</span> interviews were conducted with nine teachers from two primary and two secondary schools to obtain their views regarding teacher leadership, whilst affording them opportunities to make suggestions for collaborative teacher leadership development. Having employed a phenomenological approach and thematic analysis as method, this paper proposes a collaborative teacher leadership development framework (CTLDF). Significant about the CTLDF is that teacher leaders should consider ausgang as a way of opening the door for collaboration, homo economicus as a collaborative act and parrhesia as <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> towards collaborative teacher leadership. The findings reveal that teacher leaders should cultivate a readiness to create opportunities for collaborative leadership development. The study recommends that teacher leaders should first have to be cognizant about their own individual strengths, whilst slowly starting initiatives to collaborate in order to sustain improvements in teacher leadership practices.</p>

<p>The present research examined relationships between parental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support, parental psychological control, and Chinese emerging adults’ autonomous regulation in their university studies as well as dysregulation in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> engagement. A total of 287 (102 female and 185 male) Chinese university students reported on their perceived parenting styles, psychological needs, and behavior regulation. Results showed that basic psychological need satisfaction was positively associated with parental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support and autonomous regulation of learning; need frustration was positively correlated with parental psychological control and dysregulation in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> engagement. More importantly, psychological need frustration was a mediator of the relation between parental psychological control and dysregulation in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> engagement. Our findings suggest that students living in an <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive familial environment tend to have satisfied psychological needs as well as autonomous learning behavior. Impairment of psychological needs could be one of the mechanisms through which psychologically controlling parenting was linked to dysregulation of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use in Chinese culture.</p>

<p>Americans are pervasively exposed to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, news, and online content. Some of this content is designed to be deliberately deceptive and manipulative. However, it is interspersed amongst other content from friends and family, advertising, and legitimate news. Filtering content violates key societal values of freedom of expression and inquiry. Taking no action, though, leaves users at the mercy of individuals and groups who seek to use both single articles and complex patterns of content to manipulate how Americans consume, act, work, and even think. Warning labels, which do not block content but instead aid the user in making informed consumption decisions, have been proposed as a potential solution to this dilemma. Ideally, they would respect the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of users to determine what media they consume while combating intentional deception and manipulation through its identification to the user. This paper considers the perception of Americans regarding the use of warning labels to alert users to potentially deceptive content. It presents the results of a population representative national study and analysis of perceptions in terms of key demographics.</p>

<p>Mobile-assisted Language Learning (MALL) has been globally popular. Yet, experimental studies investigating the results of different treatments between additional MALL and standard MALL implementations in Indonesian university context are still understudied. This research sought to investigate the extent to which additional MALL activities as a treatment to an EFL experimental group of university students could improve their English given the limited class time and large sized classes. The subjects of this study were two second semester classes of English Literature students. The experimental class, a low-performing group, was asked to watch a youtube video twice or thrice a week in addition to the standard online learning during the Covid-19 pandemic while the controlled class, a better performing group, was not given this treatment. The findings revealed that (1) experimental students significantly improved their pronunciation, intonation, vocabulary and fluency but not their formal assessment results; (2) though assigned additional MALL activities, the experimental group, due to limited financial ability for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>, spent roughly as much time as the controlled group; ((3) bad <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> connection and low economic affordability contributed significantly to the less satisfactory result of MALL; (4) due to the standard online learning during the pandemic, both experimental and controlled students experienced increased exposures, enthusiasm, motivation, range of independent activites, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and English ability; (5) real time students’ collaboration is challenging. This study suggests that MALL somehow allows greater English improvement and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> development and therefore is recommended that universities and respective local governments especially in remote areas provide the necessary supports.</p>

<p>Applying an integrated theoretical model consisting of the socioecological theory, the self-determination theory, and the broaden-and-build theory, the present study tested a moderated mediation model of parental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support, filial piety, and gratitude to study how these factors are jointly related to pathological <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use (PIU) in Chinese undergraduate students. A total of 1054 Chinese undergraduate students (M age = 20.35, SD = 1.00, 34.7% females) aged between 16 and 24 years participated in this study. They were instructed to complete self-reported questionnaires on parental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support, filial piety, gratitude, and PIU. The results showed that parental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support was negatively associated with PIU, and filial piety partially mediated this relation. Specifically, parental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support was positively related to filial piety, which, in turn, was negatively associated with PIU. In addition, gratitude moderated the first path of the indirect relation and the direct relation of this mediation effect. To be specific, undergraduate students with higher gratitude showed high filial piety and low PIU, in the context of low parental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support, than those with lower gratitude. Taken together, the current study contributes to extant research by highlighting the vital role of parental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support in mitigating undergraduate students’ PIU and illustrating how filial piety explains the underlying mechanism of this association. This study also provides novel insights into intervention or prevention programs by demonstrating that gratitude alleviates the adverse effect of low parental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support on students’ PIU.</p>

<p>Technology-enhanced collaborative writing (TECW) for second language development is receiving increasing research attention from educators and teachers. However, there have been few review studies investigating how teachers implement this activity, how they use technology for the implementation, and what challenges they have. To better prepare practitioners to use digital tools for collaborative writing among their students, we reviewed 42 relevant studies focusing on their implementation identifying nine main TECW practices. These include: receiving teacher training; grouping students; training students on collaboration; training students on technology; providing students with new knowledge of writing; monitoring processes and giving immediate help; providing sufficient <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to students; evaluating outcomes and giving feedback; and encouraging students’ reflection. Technology could support TECW implementation by expediting information delivery, developing group workspaces and group <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>rooms, recording students’ writing and collaboration behaviours and visualising their thoughts, enabling teacher commentary and information post, and presenting organised, analysed records of the TECW process. Challenges to TECW included: students’ reluctance to collaborate and difficulties using new technology. Based on the review, we argue that teachers can influence the implementation of TECW from cognitive, metacognitive, behavioural, and motivational aspects. Teacher training, student <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and the size of writing groups are potential areas for future research in TECW.</p>

<p>A modern society is a combination of several critical infrastructures, of which international and national maritime transportation systems are essential parts. Digitalization makes it possible to increase levels of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in maritime systems. It also means fully existing <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>environments in maritime processes. In <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>environments, it is crucial there is trustable information communication between system elements of the process, alongside the usability, reliability, and integrity of systems data in the operating environment. In order to develop maritime <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in Finland the Sea4Value / Fairway (S4VF) research program has been developed. At the first stage of the program, the main goal is to create automated fairway piloting feature in the near future. An automated remote piloting process, “ePilotage,” will be a complex system of systems entity. This paper provides a research approach to investigating the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security risks at the system levels of process. It emphasizes the importation of comprehensive risk assessment to increase the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security of fairway operations. The findings of the study are located in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security risks in critical information flows between the main system blocks of the fairway process. The research question is “How can the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security risks of automated remote fairway operations be evaluated?” The main findings are related to the probabilities of the risks in all levels of process stakeholders’ responsibilities. Risk assessment methodology, that has been described, is based on attack probabilities against probabilities to defend actions of adversarial in use of communication technologies. Risks assessment factors have been identified and the risk assessment tool have been proposed.</p>

<p>Abstract Artificial intelligence ethics requires a united approach from policymakers, AI companies, and individuals, in the development, deployment, and use of these technologies. However, sometimes discussions can become fragmented because of the different levels of governance (Schmitt in AI Ethics 1–12, 2021) or because of different values, stakeholders, and actors involved (Ryan and Stahl in J Inf Commun Ethics Soc 19:61–86, 2021). Recently, these conflicts became very visible, with such examples as the dismissal of AI ethics researcher Dr.&nbsp;Timnit Gebru from Google and the resignation of whistle-blower Frances Haugen from <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>. Underpinning each debacle was a conflict between the organisation’s economic and business interests and the morals of their employees. This paper will examine tensions between the ethics of AI organisations and the values of their employees, by providing an exploration of the AI ethics literature in this area, and a qualitative analysis of three workshops with AI developers and practitioners. Common ethical and social tensions (such as power asymmetries, mistrust, societal risks, harms, and lack of transparency) will be discussed, along with proposals on how to avoid or reduce these conflicts in practice (e.g., building trust, fair allocation of responsibility, protecting employees’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and encouraging ethical training and practice). Altogether, we suggest the following steps to help reduce ethical issues within AI organisations: improved and diverse ethics education and training within businesses; internal and external ethics auditing; the establishment of AI ethics ombudsmen, AI ethics review committees and an AI ethics watchdog; as well as access to trustworthy AI ethics whistle-blower organisations.</p>

<p>With the development of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, the social governance model is changing from one-way management to two-way interaction, from offline to online-offline integration, and from simple government supervision to paying more attention to social collaborative governance, which requires the construction of a new pattern of grassroots social governance. Improve the institutionalized channels of mass participation in grass-roots social governance. We will improve the urban and rural grass-roots governance system that combines <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, rule of law and rule of virtue under the leadership of party organizations, improve the community management and service mechanism, implement grid management and service, give play to the role of mass organizations and social organizations, give play to the self-discipline function of trade associations and chambers of commerce, realize the benign interaction between government governance and social regulation, and residents’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and consolidate the foundation of grass-roots social governance. Accelerate the modernization of urban social governance. Promote social governance and service focus to the grassroots level, sink more resources to the grassroots level, and better provide accurate and refined services. Specifically, the requirements for the construction of governance system can be analyzed into four requirements: intelligent governance, participatory governance, municipal governance and media governance.</p>

<p>This paper explores Hungarian university students’ autonomous learning behaviors during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Hungary (March-June 2020). A self-developed questionnaire was used to explore some aspects of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> relying on the action-oriented dimensions of Tassinari’s (2015) dynamic model of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The present paper aimed to investigate how university students in Hungary regulated their learning processes during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020 with regards to three <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>y (ICT)-based teaching modes. Based on a quantitative study of the constructs of goal setting, management of the learning process and monitoring of efficiency, the researchers examine to what extent students were capable of adapting, through the exercise of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, to challenges posed by the altered learning environment. Results of the study also show that participants had different perceptions of the three teaching modes and that students’ exercise of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> influenced their perception of these ICT-based teaching modes.</p>

<p>The world has witnessed democratic decline in 23 countries worldwide during the last decade (Freedom House, 2019) in the context of rising nationalism and right-wing populism (Fraser, 2017; Robertson, 2018, 2020). The political importance of this topic is rooted in the fact that higher education is one of the most crucial public goods (Marginson, 2007, 2017) and governments tend to exercise tighter control over HEIs while democratic conditions worsening (Perry, 2015). Although many studies have examined the effects of the transition to democracy on higher education globally (O’Donnell et al., 2013; O’Donnell et al., 1986, Salto, 2020), very few have studied the reverse trend – democratic backsliding. Given that university <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is a wider term that encompasses the practises undertaken by universities to operate, researching its aspects, and assessing the true implications of democratic backsliding on universities represents an important field for current and future research.
 My research investigates the impact of democratic backsliding on the university <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, by examining the cases of Turkey, Hungary, and Poland. These countries were considered democracies until the 2010s, but they are increasingly moving away from democracy (Freedom House, 2020). The study draws on an extensive analysis of publicly accessible government laws and regulations, university decrees, mission statements, political pamphlets, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online media</span> sources and interviews, and grey literature to analyze institutional responses as well as field work and interviews. I employ neoliberal authoritarianism and historical institutionalism as a framework to investigate the critical junctures and institutional changes affecting appointive (hiring, promotion, and dismissal of staff), financial (funding levels and criteria, preparation and allocation of the university budget, and accountability), and academic (access, curriculum, degree requirements, and academic freedom) <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (Ordorika, 2003).</p>

<p>Middle school brings rapid developmental changes for adolescents, and parent engagement is as essential as ever. However, what worked for parent-teacher partnerships in elementary school doesn’t fit so well in middle school. Adolescents are building their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and teachers must help empower parents’ efforts to bolster students as independent learners through academic socialization. The authors explore how a brief <span style="background-color:lightgreen">texting</span> intervention might build trust between teachers and parents, empower parents to support their children, and contribute to students’ confidence and belonging in school. Results indicate that brief communications sent by text may bolster parent engagement efforts in middle school.</p>

<p>The abilities of the human hand have always fascinated people, and many studies have been devoted to describing and understanding a mechanism so perfect and important for human activities. Hand loss can significantly affect the level of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and the capability of performing the activities of daily life. the technological improvements have led to the development of mechanically advanced commercial prostheses, the control strategies are rather simple (proportional or on/off control). The use of these commercial systems is unnatural and not intuitive, and therefore frequently abandoned by amputees. The components of an active prosthetic hand are the me<span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>ronic device, the decoding system of human biological signals into gestures and the control law that translates all the inputs into desired movements. The real challenge is the development of a control law replacing human hand functions. This paper presents a literature review of the control strategies of prosthetics hands with a multiple-layer or hierarchical structure, and points out the main critical aspects of the current solutions, in terms of human’ functions replicated with the prosthetic device. The paper finally provides several suggestions for designing a control strategy able to mimic the functions of the human hand.</p>
