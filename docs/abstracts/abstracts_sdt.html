<p>In the present study we investigate the advantages of using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s in an English as a foreign language EFL classroom. We compared two groups of Japanese university students who were either prohibited from using their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s in the classroom, or encouraged to use them for academic purposes, examining whether those using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s in their EFL lessons would show a tendency toward being autonomous. The results indicated that students who were encouraged to use their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s during class were inclined to study more in their free time as well as show signs of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> by taking charge of their learning and consider ways to improve their own study habits and English proficiency. Our conclusion is that language teachers and learners should be encouraged to use <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s in the classroom as a means of fueling the desire to learn.</p>

<p>Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) call for integrating knowledge and practice in learning experiences in K-12 science education. PlantingScience (PS), an ideal curriculum for use as an NGSS model, is a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">computer-mediated</span> collaborative learning environment intertwining scientific inquiry, classroom instruction, and online mentoring from scientists. With implementation in hundreds of classrooms across the United States, science teachers have noted PS as successful in motivating their students to engage in classroom inquiry investigations. To investigate the role of the online scientist-mentors in motivating students in the PS learning environment, we used self-determination theory (SDT) to guide a multiple case study of 10 student inquiry teams engaged in PS in a rural public school in a large Southwestern U.S. state. We used online dialogues between scientist-mentors and their assigned student inquiry teams to answer research questions about the motivational support provided by scientist-mentors and the association between this support and students’ engagement in scientific inquiry. Analyses revealed a general relationship between scientist-mentor motivational support and student inquiry engagement. Differences were observed in the specific ways in which scientists supported <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness. Student inquiry engagement corresponded to high support in relatedness, whereas correspondence with <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support was low.</p>

<p>The present study reports on correlational data gathered from an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> survey to explore why forced-choice dilemma situations relate to depressive symptoms among multiracial people (N = 317). Specifically, a model was tested that explored the role of identity <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (the extent to which multiracial people feel they can racially identify however they desire) and public regard (the extent to which multiracial people think others value their multiracial identity). The results of the model suggest that forced-choice dilemmas predict greater depressive symptoms because forcedchoice dilemmas may promote greater beliefs that their multiracial identity is devalued in society and more generally restrict identity <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Implications are discussed in terms of multiracial health and public policies regarding assessments of racial identities. jasp_634 1657..1677 Researchers widely accept that people of multiracial heritage face unique challenges associated with their membership in multiple racial categories. These unique challenges have been proposed as precipitating factors in racial identity development, overall psychological health, and the occurrence of problem behaviors, including poor academic performance among multiracial people (Gillem, Cohn, &amp; Throne, 2001; Logan, 1981; Rockquemore &amp; Brunsma, 2002a, 2002b; Shih &amp; Sanchez, 2005). In a review of work on multiracial health, Shih and Sanchez proposed that forced-choice dilemmas may contribute to multiracial people’s psychological well-being. Thus, the present study is designed to examine empirically the possible link between self-reported experiences of forced-choice dilemmas and psychological wellbeing, as well as the mechanisms that may account for the relationship. Forced-choice dilemmas refer to situations in which multiracial people are asked or pressured to choose between their multiple racial identities, rather than being allowed to identify with their multiple racial identities (Standen, 1996). Because of the difficulties multiracial people face, many theorists have erroneously predicted that multiracial people will exhibit worse</p>

<p>I. Introduction Faculty members have been described as purveyors of culture, engines of economic development, and generators of scientific, medical, and technological discoveries that transform human society (Schuster &amp; Finkelstein, 2006). They have been characterized as institutional agents who can foster the development of social and cultural capital, particularly within and among historically disadvantaged communities (Stanton-Salazar, 1997). Faculty have been at the forefront of social change movements, and have been viewed as teachers and mentors who can empower students to achieve their highest potential (Kingston-Mann &amp; Sieber, 2001). But faculty have also been described, by critics, as scam artists who focus on self-interested agendas at the expense of the education of tuition-paying students (Sykes, 1988). Collectively, faculties and their academic disciplines have been defined by some postmodernists as closed communities that endorse only certain forms of knowledge generation, primarily those forms that reinforce the power positions of well-established interests within those disciplines (Foucault, 1986). Recently, faculty have been characterized as managed professionals, whose <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> has been eroded by extensive accountability-oriented measurement systems (Rhoades, 1998) and by a rising managerialism among college and university administrators, who now are more likely to make major decisions without faculty input (Bess, 2006). These various images and metaphors suggest that expectations for the academic profession have become highly differentiated and fragmented. No longer does a quick reference to teaching, research, and service suffice to explain the work of the faculty member. Faculty roles have become increasingly complex and challenging, both for individuals to carry out and for institutions to support. Despite the multitude of images and descriptors associated with academic work, one commonality is that faculty members are people who have human needs for growth, achievement, satisfaction, and connection with others (Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000). Faculty development programs can play an important role on college and university campuses by acknowledging the human needs of faculty members, and by providing the resources, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networks, and innovative ideas that can foster the fulfillment of those needs. This paper reports on an innovative faculty development program that focused its energies on the idea that fulfilling the human needs of faculty members is an essential prerequisite</span> for ongoing growth and success within the academic profession. Many faculty development programs are organized around meeting functional needs, rather than human needs. These programs, many based in centers for teaching and learning, focus on the functional roles that faculty perform, and attempt to identify key areas within those functions that present unique challenges for faculty (e.g., teaching with technology or assessing students’ writing). These functional needs are sometimes identified systematically through a survey of faculty members, but more often the needs are identified by a faculty committee, or by an academic administrator charged with responsibilities for faculty development (Sorcinelli, Austin, Eddy, &amp; Beach, 2006). Once the functional needs have been identified, programs and services are designed to identify and convey a set of skills that can be used to improve performance within a given function (Akerlind, 2005). The programs may be tailored to fit the needs of particular faculty groups, such as junior faculty or discipline-specific issues (e.g., teaching large lecture courses in the sciences). Although these programs may acknowledge different needs by career stage and by academic discipline, they typically are not organized around foundational human needs. The goal of many of these faculty development programs is to teach faculty, for example, how to use technology or how to assess students’ writing, rather than to fulfill faculty members’ needs for growth, achievement, and collegial connection. …</p>

<p>Ecological view of human development calls for an investigation of multiple contexts surrounding children. In South Korea, traditional Confucianism and recent technological advancements serve as influential social and cultural contexts that affect parent–child relations and child development. High levels of parental control and strong emphasis on academic achievement have long been distinctive features of Korean parenting practices, which are attributable to Confucian values. Additionally, Korean children’s <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> dependency (MPD) has become a growing concern, as South Korea developed as an IT powerhouse. Combined, these contexts resulted in high parental control of children’s <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> use, so that such electronic devices would not hinder learning and achievement. Effects of high parental control on children’s MPD and their school life, however, have yet to be discovered. We hypothesized, that, unlike parents’ intentions, psychological control is more likely to increase MPD and disrupt school life. To examine this research model, we made use of the first and third wave data from Korea Children and Youth Panel Survey. Participants were 2378 children (52.2&nbsp;% boys) of the same age of 10 in the first wave. After multiple imputation for missing values, hierarchical logistic regression followed to examine the mediational model. The results verified the hypothesized model, showing significant adverse influence of psychological control on MPD, self-regulated learning and school adjustment. MPD fully mediated the effect of psychological control on self-regulations, while partially mediating the effects on school adjustment. Implications for Korean parents with regard to supporting children’s psychological <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> was discussed.</p>

<p>This paper argues that if used correctly, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">computer-mediated</span> courseware (CMC), in the form of an online Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) such as Blackboard or Moodle, has the potential to offer adult learners in university settings an optimal <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive environment for learning English as a second language at a distance. The paper firstly considers how to promote learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> through offering participants choices during the initial stages of a course through a negotiated syllabus. It then divides the language learning process into metacognitive and cognitive linguistic capacities and provides examples of strategies to increase <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in these spheres. <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> with regard to metacognitive linguistic capacities can be developed first by the multimodal aspect of CMC, in particular, the unprecedented access to resources, second, through the array of mediums to select in the creation and submission of assignments and third, through the notion of ‘dissemination’ (Mayes, 2002), which allows for ‘vicarious learning’ (Bandura, 1986). <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> with regard to cognitive linguistic capacities can be promoted through goal-oriented participant interaction on spoken and written forums on the platform, followed by consciousness-raising language activities guiding students to notice patterns in the language. In conclusion, it is suggested that a VLE might lead to optimum learning through the facilitation of a state of ‘flow’ or ‘autotelic’ activity, a concept closely related to <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and intrinsic motivation.</p>

<p>Subsumed under the umbrella of User Experience (UX), practitioners and academics of Human-Computer Interaction look for ways to broaden their understanding of what constitutes ‘’pleasurable experiences’’ with technology. The present study considered the fulfilment of universal psychological needs, such as competence, relatedness, popularity, stimulation, meaning, security, or <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, to be the major source of positive experience with interactive technologies. To explore this, we collected over 500 positive experiences with interactive products (e.g., <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s, computers). As expected, we found a clear relationship between need fulfilment and positive affect, with stimulation, relatedness, competence and popularity being especially salient needs. Experiences could be further categorized by the primary need they fulfil, with apparent qualitative differences among some of the categories in terms of the emotions involved. Need fulfilment was clearly linked to hedonic quality perceptions, but not as strongly to pragmatic quality (i.e., perceived usability), which supports the notion of hedonic quality as ‘’motivator’’ and pragmatic quality as ‘’hygiene factor.’’ Whether hedonic quality ratings reflected need fulfilment depended on the belief that the product was responsible for the experience (i.e., attribution).</p>

<p>People increasingly rely on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social network site</span>s (SNSs) to find out timely information about crises. Thus, emergency managers are interested in how people participate and how to promote their participation in SNSs after crises. Based on self-determination theory, this study develops a theoretical model to examine the mechanisms through which different types of motivation contribute to various participating behaviors in SNSs after crises. Survey data were collected after the Ya’an earthquake, which occurred in China on April 20, 2013. Our results show that while autonomous motivation is positively related to posting new content about the earthquake, controlled motivation is positively related to commenting on others’ content about the earthquake. Furthermore, perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and perceived relatedness are positively related to autonomous motivation. We suggest that emergency managers may want to promote different types of motivations, depending on the specific participating behavior preferred after crises.</p>

<p>In two studies, we demonstrate that attitudes toward traditional sexual roles are linked with increased sexual passivity for women but decreased passivity for men. For both genders, sexual passivity predicts poor sexual functioning and satisfaction. Study 1 showed that endorsement of traditional sexual roles of male dominance and female passivity relates to greater sexual passivity among college-aged heterosexual women but less passivity for college-aged heterosexual men. For both young men and women, greater sexual passivity predicts less overall sexual satisfaction. The findings for Study 2 replicate Study 1 among sexually experienced adults recruited over the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> mediated these relationships, which persisted when controlling for multiple potential confounds.</p>

<p>The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> provides an easily accessible way to meet certain needs. Over-reliance on it leads to problematic use, which studies show can be predicted by psychological distress. Self-determination theory proposes that we all have the basic need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competency, and relatedness. This has been shown to explain the motivations behind problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use. This study hypothesizes that individuals who are psychologically disturbed because their basic needs are not being met are more vulnerable to becoming reliant on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> when they seek such needs satisfaction from online activities, and tests a model in which basic needs predict problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use, fully mediated by psychological distress. Problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use, psychological distress, and basic needs satisfaction were psychometrically measured in a sample of 229 Hong Kong University students and structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesized model. All indices showed the model has a good fit. Further, statistical testing supported a mediation effect for psychological distress between needs satisfaction and problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use. The results extend our understanding of the development and prevention of problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use based on the framework of self-determination theory. Psychological distress could be used as an early predictor, while preventing and treating problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use should emphasize the fulfillment of unmet needs.</p>

<p>Nearly 6,000 science questions collected from five different web-based, TV-based and school-based sources were rigorously analyzed in order to identify profiles of K-12 students’ interest in science, and how these profiles change with age. The questions were analyzed according to their topic, thinking level, motivation for and level of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in raising the question, the object of interest and its magnitude, and psychological distance of the object in question from the asker. Characteristics of the asker, such as gender, grade level, and country of origin were also considered, alongside characteristics of the data source, such as language, setting (<span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, school, TV), and the potential science-attentiveness of the users. Six meta-clusters of children’s and adolescents’ interest in science were identified using cluster analysis of their self-generated science questions. A developmental shift in interest from non-classical to classical school science subjects was noted. Other age-related developments, such as an increase in thinking level as reflected by the questions, a decrease in organization level and the psychological distance of the object in question with age were also explored. Advantages and shortcomings of web-based data collection for educational research are discussed, as are the implications of the results obtained using this methodology for formal science education. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.&nbsp;J Res Sci Teach 46: 999–1022, 2009</p>

<p>The ethical problem of privacy lies at the core of computer ethics and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> ethics discussions. The extensive use of personal data in digital networks poses a serious threat to the user’s right of privacy not only at the level of a user’s data integrity and security but also at the level of a user’s identity and freedom. In normative ethical theory the need for an informational self-deterministic approach of privacy is stressed with greater emphasis on the control over personal data. However, scant attention has been paid on a virtue ethics approach of information privacy. Plotinus’ discussion of self-determination is related to ethical virtue, human freedom and intellectual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The Plotinian virtue ethics approach of self-determination is not primarily related to the sphere of moral action, but to the quality of the self prior to moral practice. In this paper, it is argued that the problem of information privacy should be reconsidered in the light of Plotinus’ virtue ethics and his notion of self-determination.</p>

<p>Previous studies on problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use have focused almost exclusively on the fact that presence of negative functioning, such as social anxiety, depressive symptoms, or loneliness, represents a risk factor for unhealthy use of the web. For this reason the aim of the present study was to investigate the association between psychological well-being dimensions and problematic use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> communicative services. In the current study 495 undergraduate students were recruited. The Italian adaptations of the Psychological Well-being Scales and the Generalized Problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> Use Scale 2 (GPIUS2) were used to assess psychological well-being dimensions and generalized problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use, respectively. Psychological well-being dimensions explained a significant portion of variance for the GPIUS2 total score levels, after controlling for sex, age, and occupational status. The levels of <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span>, Environmental Mastery, and Positive Relations with Others acted as significant negative predictors of the tendency to use the web for regulating negative feelings, compulsive use of the web, and the negative outcomes that can arise as a result. The overall findings of the present study provide preliminary evidence that low psychological well-being is associated with problematic use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> communicative services.</p>

<p>As web technologies gradually become versatile and more powerful, more flexible paths and opportunities are revealed for self-directed learning and online assessment. It is hoped officials and advocates recognize IT related certification programs (NSSB Recognizes First IT Certification Program 2002). The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and Computing Core Certification (IC3®) certification program is designed for individuals to develop digital literacy skills, including fundamental computer and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use. The particular interest of the study is to explore the relative contributions of the Certification Recognition Program (CRP) and associated <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of participation and achieved literacy for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> computing &amp; technology (ICT), as well as the interactive influences of the degree programs and grade levels. Five hundred and ninety six male undergraduates majoring in IT were invited to participate in the Certification Recognition Program for a calendar year. The certification recognition program covers a set of three standardized tests based on the IC3® by CertiportTM. The study found ICT literacy is predicated by the students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of participation (AP) in the Certification Recognition Program (CRP), and SP was related to the grade level (GL) and the enrolled degree program (DP), indirectly affecting ICT literacy as a result of the transiting effect of AP.</p>

<p>Deriving self-worth from romantic relationships (relationship contingency) may have implications for women’s sexual motives in relationships. Because relationship contingency enhances motivation to sustain relationships to maintain positive self-worth, relationship contingent women may engage in sex to maintain and enhance their relationships (relational sex motives). Using structural equation modeling on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> survey data from a convenience sample of 462 women in heterosexual and lesbian relationships, we found that greater relationship contingency predicted greater relational sex motives, which simultaneously predicted both sexual satisfaction and dissatisfaction via two distinct motivational states. Having sex to improve intimacy with one’s partner was associated with greater sexual satisfaction and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, while having sex to earn partner’s approval was associated with sexual dissatisfaction and inhibition. While some differences exist between lesbian and heterosexual relationships, relationship contingency had sexual costs and benefits, regardless of relationship type.</p>

The present research investigated the psychometric properties of a French adaptation of this scale to the sport setting in two studies. In Study 1, the French version of the PASSES (i.e., I’Echelle des Perceptions du Soutien a I’Autonomie en Sport; EPSAS) was adapted for sport and completed by 134 athletes. Results of an exploratory factor analysis revealed a unidimensional structure with factor loadings ranging from .63 to .85. Results also showed satisfactory internal consistency (qc = .91). In Study 2 (N = 203), a confirmatory factor analysis provided further support for the unidimensional structure of the questionnaire. Convergent validity of the instrument was also obtained through correlations with meaningful constructs, namely intrinsic motivation and identif…</p>

<p>This article explores youth narratives of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> risks and opportunities brought about by user anonymity. Using an essay-based study of 258 youth (mean age 15.4 years, 56% female), we examined youth narratives concerning the effects of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> anonymity on youth behavior online. Narratives were written anonymously to maximize disclosure. The needs categories of self-determination theory (SDT) for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, relatedness, and competence were used to identify risks and opportunities in youth narratives. The analysis of the data was thematic, using both quantitative and qualitative methods with SDT providing an effective descriptive framework. Quantitative thematic analysis showed that 17% of the narratives included a notion of competence, 32% <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and 30% relatedness. Risks were also prevalent in the narratives, with primary themes of 74% <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying and insults, 27% identity theft and risky false identity, and 18% sexual harassment or exploitation.

<p>Background: <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> interventions for improving health and well-being have the potential to reach many people and fill gaps in service provision. Serious gaming interfaces provide opportunities to optimize user adherence and impact. Health interventions based in theory and evidence and tailored to psychological constructs have been found to be more effective to promote behavior change. Defining the design elements which engage users and help them to meet their goals can contribute to better informed serious games. Objective: To elucidate design elements important in SPARX, a serious game for adolescents with depression, from a user-centered perspective. Methods: We proposed a model based on an established theory of health behavior change and practical features of serious game design to organize ideas and rationale. We analyzed data from 5 studies comprising a total of 22 focus groups and 66 semistructured interviews conducted with youth and families in New Zealand and Australia who had viewed or used SPARX. User perceptions of the game were applied to this framework. Results: A coherent framework was established using the three constructs of self-determination theory (SDT), <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness, to organize user perceptions and design elements within four areas important in design: computer game, accessibility, working alliance, and learning in immersion. User perceptions mapped well to the framework, which may assist developers in understanding the context of user needs. By mapping these elements against the constructs of SDT, we were able to propose a sound theoretical base for the model. Conclusions: This study’s method allowed for the articulation of design elements in a serious game from a user-centered perspective within a coherent overarching framework. The framework can be used to deliberately incorporate serious game design elements that support a user’s sense of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness, key constructs which have been found to mediate motivation at all stages of the change process. The resulting model introduces promising avenues for future exploration. Involving users in program design remains an imperative if serious games are to be fit for purpose.</p>

This article aims to explain differences between a group learning English on a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> page and a face-to-face group in terms of Self-Determination Theory (SDT). SDT focuses on three main variables, which improve self-determination and motivation outside but also inside the classroom: <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence and relatedness. The main research question was: how can we explain differences between a face-to-face group (FTF) and a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> group learning a foreign language in terms of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence and relatedness? The results indicate that there was a significant difference between the two groups in terms of learning outcomes as well as in the three SDT variables. Students in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> group felt more autonomous, competent and related. All three SDT variables correlated with learning outcomes. There was, however, almost no relationship among the SDT variables with learning outcomes within the two groups. The strongest predictor of the difference in learning outcomes proved to be relatedness, followed by competence.</p>

<p>The use of monitoring devices (data collection) in business organizations is facilitated through New <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies (NICT) such as fingerprint, facial or eyes biometric, time clocks, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> surveillance, remote tracking of employees via GPS, and others. While standard economic theory advocates the use of incentive systems and surveillance to increase performance at work, some empirical studies show a fall in the level and quality of effort after the introduction of monitoring. Using self-determination theory (SDT), we explain this phenomenon by the negative impact of “monitoring systems extensiveness” on employees’ intrinsic motivation (IM). We hypothesize the mediation of this impact by the degree to which employees perceive their supervisors as being “<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> supportive”. We also investigate the possibility of a moderating effect of “employees’ beliefs about the purposes of devices for monitoring” on the relationships between “monitoring systems extensiveness”, “perception of supervision” and “intrinsic motivation”. We test these hypotheses using a questionnaire, collected in France, from 579 employees having at least one supervisor. Developing a structural equation model, we find: firstly, a significant crowding out effect of IM by monitoring; secondly, this crowding out effect is significantly mediated by employees’ perception of supervision; thirdly, we confirm a strong positive relation between an <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> supportive supervision and IM. Finally, we do not find any significant moderation by employees’ beliefs about the purposes attributed to monitoring devices.</p>

Some theories suggest that demanding conditions impair self-regulation, by undermining <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, interfering with skilled performance and working memory, and depleting energy resources. Other theories, however, suggest that demanding conditions improve self-regulation by mobilizing super-ordinate control processes. The present article integrates both kinds of theories by proposing that the self-regulatory impact of demanding conditions depends on how people adapt to such conditions. When people are action-oriented, demanding conditions may lead to improved self-regulation. When people are state-oriented, demanding conditions may lead to impaired self-regulation. Consistent with this idea, action versus state orientation strongly moderates the influence of demands on self-regulatory performance. The impact of demanding conditions on self-regulation is thus not fixed, but modifiable by psychological processes. Demanding conditions are pervasive in everyday life. At the workplace, employees need to stay abreast of rapid technological innovations and deal with constant pressures towards increased efficiency and productivity. In educational settings, students must meet high standards of academic excellence, often while performing low-paying jobs to cover high tuitions and while taking care of their family members. Even among friends, there are always <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s to be responded to, birthdays to be remembered, meetings to be arranged, favors to be returned, along with countless other duties and obligations. Given that demanding conditions are exceedingly common, it is important to understand how people can most effectively deal with such conditions. Unfortunately, psychological theories offer seemingly contradictory insights into this matter. Some influential theories propose that demanding conditions are likely to undermine self-regulation (Baumeister &amp; Showers, 1986; Beilock, Kulp, Holt, &amp; Carr, 2004; Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000; Muraven &amp; Baumeister, 2000). However, other theories suggest that demanding conditions lead people to marshal their self-regulatory resources, resulting in enhanced motivation and self-regulation (e.g., Botvinick, Braver, Barch, Carter, &amp; Cohen, 2001; Brehm &amp; Self, 1989; Trope &amp; Fishbach, 2000). These different theories have very different practical implications. If demanding conditions undermine self-regulation, people will be best off by avoiding demanding conditions. By contrast, if demanding conditions facilitate selfregulation, people may be advised to seek out demanding conditions whenever they can. In the present article, we develop an integrative theoretical analysis of how demanding conditions influence self-regulation. In what follows, we begin by taking a closer look at the basic ways in which demanding conditions might help or hurt self-regulation. Next, drawing upon action control theory (Kuhl, 1984, 1994a), we propose that the self-regulatory impact of demanding conditions depends on people’s mode of adapting to these</p>

<p>The aim of this study was to assess a modified version of the trans-contextual model (Hagger, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Chat</span>zisarantis, Culverhouse, &amp; Biddle, 2003) based on self-determination theory (Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985) and the theory of planned behaviour (Ajzen, 1985). The modified version included two additional components: use of learning strategies and positive general feedback. It was hypothesized that students’ perceptions of how they use learning strategies taught by their physical education (PE) teachers and perceived positive general feedback would influence students’ intrinsic motivation, intentions, and physical activity behaviour in a leisure-time context through intrinsic motivation in PE. A structural equation model supported the hypotheses and demonstrated that the use of learning strategies and perceived positive general feedback in PE indirectly influenced intrinsic motivation in leisure time through the effect of intrinsic motivation in PE. There was a direct effect of perceived positive general feedback on physical activity behaviour as well as an indirect effect through the motivational sequence.</p>

<p>The prevalence of depression is high and results in huge costs for society. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>-based cognitive behavioural treatment (ICBT) has been suggested for use in primary care and has been shown to be more effective when combined with human support. However, non-completion rates remain a challenge. Current recommendations state that steps to improve persistence with ICBT should be determined and the impact of therapist support on persistence explored. A few earlier studies have explored motivations to persist with ICBT without face-to-face therapist support. The present study explored the motivation to persist as experienced by a group of patients who sought help in primary care and used “blended care”, i.e.&nbsp;ICBT supported by short face-to-face consultations. To elucidate motivation in an everyday context and the meaning of patients’ experiences we chose a phenomenological hermeneutical approach. We interviewed participants in the intervention group of a randomized controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy of an ICBT programme called MoodGYM, an eHealth intervention used to treat depression. Fourteen participants, both completers and non-completers, went through individual, semi-structured interviews after they ended their treatment. Hope of recovery and a desire to gain control of one’s life were identified as intrinsic motivators. The feeling of being able to freely choose how, when and where to complete the ICBT modules was identified as an important supporting condition and satisfied the participants’ need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Furthermore, the importance of a sense of belonging towards partners, friends or family was essential for motivation as was the ability to identify with ICBT content. Another supporting condition was the experience of connectedness when met with acknowledgement, flexibility and feedback from a qualified therapist in the face-to-face consultations. A key finding was that participants were motivated to persist with ICBT when their overall need for relatedness was satisfied. This was achieved through a sense of belonging towards partners, friends and family. Connectedness with the therapist and the participant’s ability to identify with the ICBT modules also gave a sense of relatedness. Improving these motivational aspects may increase patients’ persistence with ICBT.</p>

<p>As <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> grow in popularity, more and more people produce user-generated content (UGC) in various types of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. Thus, practitioners are interested in how to support people’s motivation to produce UGC. While previous literature has examined various factors influencing people’s motivation to produce UGC, few studies have examined the role of other participants as well as the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> sites. Based on self-determination theory, our study examines the relationship between content attractiveness, trust, perceived competence and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, individual differences, and motivation to produce UGC. Using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social network site</span>s as the context of our study, we tested our hypotheses with U.S. college students, and the results supported our hypotheses. We contribute to the current literature by demonstrating that, when individuals perceive that other participants enjoy their UGC and trust <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> sites, the individuals’ perceived competence and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> are enhanced, which in turn supports their motivation to produce UGC.</p>

<p>Pro-social behaviors have been associated with enhanced well-being, but what psychological mechanisms explain this connection? Some theories suggest that beneficence-the sense of being able to give-inherently improves well-being, whereas evidence from self-determination theory (Weinstein &amp; Ryan, 2010) shows that increases in well-being are mediated by satisfaction of innate psychological needs for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness. Here we simultaneously assess these two explanations. Study 1 (N = 335) used a cross-sectional survey with an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> sample to develop a measure to assess beneficence satisfaction. The next two cross-sectional <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>-sample studies tested mediators between pro-social behavior and general well-being (Study 2, N = 332) and situational peak moment well-being (Study 3, N = 180). A fourth study (N = 85) used a diary method with university students to assess daily fluctuations in well-being associated with needs and beneficence. It was shown across all studies that both the three psychological needs and beneficence satisfaction mediate the relations between pro-social actions and well-being, with all four factors emerging as independent predictors. Together, these studies underscore the role of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness in explaining the well-being benefits of benevolence, and they also point to the independent role of beneficence as a source of human wellness.</p>

<p>The purpose of this study was to test the structural and criterion validity of scores derived from the Relatedness to Others in Physical Activity Scale (ROPAS). The participants (n1 = 893; n2 = 522) completed the ROPAS in addition to demographic questions (study 1) and well-being indicators (study 2) using cross-sectional, nonexperimental surveys. Confirmatory factor analysis (study 1) supported the tenability of a 6-item ROPAS measurement model that was invariant across gender. Higher ROPAS scores were associated with greater perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and competence and greater well-being (study 2). Overall, these findings suggested the ROPAS displays a number of psychometric properties that render the instrument useful for investigating issues of belonging and connectedness with others in global physical activity settings. jabr_ 61..87 Self-determination theory (SDT; Deci &amp; Ryan, 2002) has become a popular framework for understanding motivational issues in physical activity contexts such as sport and exercise (Hagger &amp; <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Chat</span>zisarantis, 2007). This is not surprising given the macro-level approach taken within SDT that specifies the nature and function of human motivation as well as the conditions that facilitate (or thwart) motivational development and enhance well-being (Deci &amp; Ryan). The approach embraced within SDT centers around an “organismic-dialectic” (Deci &amp; Ryan, p.&nbsp;5), which assumes that humans are active growth-orientated organisms who seek out opportunities for assimilation within their social world. The development of human potentials central to SDT does not occur in a social vacuum but relies on ambient supports that interface with the organism’s innate tendencies to optimize motivation and promote greater well-being (Deci &amp; Ryan). The concept of basic psychological needs is central to Deci and Ryan’s (2002) meta-theory and is formally explicated within Basic Psychological Needs Theory (BPNT). Deci and Ryan extolled the importance of feeling competent,</p>

<p>The findings obtained from the study and research into the consequences of applying determined teaching styles has led to a growing interest in this area among the scientific community. The student-centered and constructivist learning environments which enable students to gain a significant understanding through their own efforts has grown in importance compared with the traditional learning environment based on the transfer of learning by teachers (Oguz, 2013). In the context of the constructivist approach, students create their own knowledge by actively participating in the learning process (Wang, 2011), and by giving importance to the learners’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. In these environments of interaction, the teacher becomes the learning facilitator, planning tasks and supporting responsibility for learning (Koc, 2006), providing students with options, helping them make their own decisions and solve problems for themselves. Consequently, this new focus provides students with opportunities to ask their own questions, and create their own learning concepts and strategies based on existing knowledge. The teacher has to accept students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and their enterprising spirit, and support them in this sense. In the context of this constructivist focus, one of the the main objectives of education is to promote students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (Ozturk, 2011).

<p>The aim of this study was to explore the effect of the Active Teen Leaders Avoiding Screen-time (ATLAS) intervention on psychological well-being in adolescent boys and to examine the potential mediating mechanisms that might explain this effect.ATLAS was evaluated using a cluster randomized controlled trial in 14 secondary schools located in low-income communities (N = 361 adolescent boys, mean age = 12.7 ± .5 years). The 20-week intervention was guided by self-determination theory and involved: professional development for teachers, provision of fitness equipment to schools, enhanced school sport sessions, researcher-led seminars, a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> application, and parental strategies for reducing screen time. Assessments were conducted at baseline and immediately post intervention (8 months). Psychological well-being was measured using the Flourishing Scale. Motivational regulations (intrinsic, identified, introjected, controlled, and amotivation) and basic psychological needs (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness) in school sport, muscular fitness, resistance training skill competency, and recreational screen time were examined as potential mediating mechanisms of the intervention effect.The intervention effect on well-being was small but statistically significant. Within a multiple mediator model, changes in <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> needs satisfaction, recreational screen time, and muscular fitness significantly mediated the effect of the intervention on psychological well-being.In addition to the physical health benefits, targeted physical activity programs for adolescent boys may have utility for mental health promotion through the mechanisms of increasing <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support and muscular fitness and reducing screen time.</p>

<p>Due to the progress in information technology, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-bullying is becoming one of the most common forms of interpersonal harm, especially among teenagers. The present study (N = 548) aimed to investigate the relation between perceived parenting style (in terms of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support and psychological control) and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-bullying in adolescence. Thereby, the study tested for the intervening role of adolescent need satisfaction (i.e., <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and relatedness), empathic concern towards others, and adolescents’ recognition of full humanness to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-bullying offenders and victims. Findings revealed both a direct and an indirect relation between parenting and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-bullying. More specifically, parental psychological control directly predicted <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-bullying, whereas parental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support related to less <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-bullying indirectly, as it was associated with the satisfaction of adolescents’ need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, which predicted more empathic concern towards others, which in turn differentially related to recognition of humanness to victims and bullies. The discussion focuses on the implications of the current findings.</p>

It should be based on promoting educational actors’ critical awareness of the educational context and their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. This paper reveals the potential of educational actors’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> as a core value of lifelong learning. It demonstrates the relevance of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> as an important competence of educational actors from philosophical, psychological and pedagogical perspectives. The paper proves that <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is beneficial for students’ and teachers’ personal and professional self-development, as well as for their educational and professional efficiency and psychological comfort. It emphasizes readiness for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in both university teachers and students as a key factor in successful and productive use of the benefits <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> offers for lifelong learning.</p>

<p>SNS is developing rapidly along with diffusion of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>. However as useage of SNS became excessive, SNS addiction became a social problem. Meanwhile the problem that users leavning SNS because of negative perceptions about SNS became issue. As both SNS addiction and continuance are important when using SNS, this study examines factors affecting <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> addiction and continuance. We derive three personal traits, which is <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, relatedness as variables that affect <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> addiction and continuance to use <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>. The authors` structural equation model using data, collected from 204 <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> user, showed that <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and competence significantly affected <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> addiction. Also, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence and relatedness significantly affect <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> continuance.</p>

<p>Abstract Successful <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> networks motivate people to engage in behaviors that speak to their most basic psychological needs through citizenship in a virtual society. These environments provide individuals with the ability to build relationships (relatedness), exercise competence, and express <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Recipes for satisfying these basic needs are vital to the success of virtual societies. This research contributes to existing literature by framing <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> interaction using the self-determination theory (SDT); the study analyzes a sample of 570 social networking participants using the generations of baby boomers, generation X, and millennials with fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). Findings indicate that affinity, belonging, interactivity, and innovativeness are all base expectations for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> networking usage, depending on the generational cohort. Indeed, understanding the motivational needs of unique generational cohorts allows marketers to more effectively design precise adaptive strategies for their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, which can impact engagement and thereby loyalty.</p>

<p>This study elucidates the experiential and motivational aspects of online health information beyond the theoretically limited instrumental perspective that dominates the extant literature. Based on a sample of 993 online health information seekers in India, the survey found that online health information seeking offers individuals greater <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness compared to face-to-face office visits with physicians. According to self-determination theory, individuals are motivated to act by a sense of volition and experience of willingness, validation of one’s skills and competencies, and feeling of connection with others who shaped one’s decisions. These 3 psychological needs, which motivate individuals to pursue what they innately seek as human beings, help explain why individuals turn online for health information. T tests showed that all 3 self-determination theory constructs -<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness-were higher for online health information seeking than for face-to-face office visits with physicians. A regression analysis found that 2 variables, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and relatedness, explained online health information seeking. Competence was not a significant factor, likely because of competency issues faced by individuals in interpreting, understanding, and making use of online health information. The findings, which do not suggest that online health information seeking would displace physicians as many have feared, offer promise for an integrated system of care. Office visits with physicians would necessarily evolve into an expanded communicative space of health information seeking instead of an alternative channel for health information.</p>

<p>Work overload or work pressure may undermine workers’ intrinsic motivation. In the present research, we tested the conditions under which this may (not) occur, including the perceived opportunity to blend on-site and off-site working through the effective use of computers and modern <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y. Our sample consisted of 657 workers (51% female) representing a variety of industries. As hypothesized, it is not high job demands per se, but high demands in combination with a high need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and a lack of perceived opportunities for blended working that undermines intrinsic work motivation. When workers high in need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> perceived opportunities for blended working, their intrinsic work motivation was not negatively affected by increasing job demands. This main finding suggests that, particularly for workers high in need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, the perceived opportunity for blended working is an effective, contemporary resource to cope with the increasing job demands typically observed in today’s workplace. Theoretically, these findings contribute to the refinement and extension of influential demands-resource models and Person-Job Fit theory. Practically, our findings may show managers how to effectively keep workers intrinsically motivated and productive in their jobs when job demands are high. We tested conditions under which high job demands may undermine work motivation.We examined the new concept of perceived opportunity for blended working.Blended working, enabled through ICTs, works when need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is high.High job demands per se do not undermine intrinsic work motivation.We emphasize the importance of fit between work context and workers’ needs.</p>

<p>ABSTRACTThe motivation of user-generated content (UGC) is a vital issue for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> providers. This study investigates this issue using the self-determination theory (SDT). The SDT identifies three fundamental human psychological needs, namely the need for competence, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and relatedness. This study aims to answer the question of how the satisfaction of these needs motivates users to produce UGC and utilizes the multi-study model comparison approach. Two survey studies were conducted in China and the United States. The partial least squares (PLS) analyses confirmed that the SDT indeed explained UGC motivation significantly and that trust beliefs support people’s need for relatedness. Post hoc analyses showed that there were significant differences between Chinese and American culture. Those results make important contributions to theory and practice. For example, practitioners need to motivate users to produce UGC by supporting their psychological needs. Besides, different trust beliefs should …</p>

<p>Abstract <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span>loafing – non-work related <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> use – is a prominent problem in modern firms. While incomplete contracts typically rule out direct control of workers’ effort, many employers hope to increase productivity through ‘soft’ control, by restricting the private use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> at work. In a lab experiment with real effort, we investigate how the temptation of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and a manager’s decision whether to restrict workers’ access to it affect the morale of workers. When tempted by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> access, workers reciprocate fair wages less than without access. Nevertheless, a manager’s decision to actively grant <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> access might increase workers’ effort: we find that highly reciprocal workers perceive the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> such a policy gives as a gift which they reciprocate with high effort despite the temptation of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>. For less reciprocal workers the temptation aspect dominates and restricting <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> access is better for the manager.</p>

<p>Clicking the Like is an idiosyncratic and essential activity in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>.Users pursuit diverse goals in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>.Overall goals in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> have significant relations with psychological well-being.Relationships between the goals for SNS use and the dimensions of psychological well-being.Enjoyment in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> has a negative relation with psychological well-being. There is scant research on the broader outcomes of IT in users life contexts beyond adoption. This study uses a goal hierarchy approach to deepen our understanding of the relationship between the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> and psychological well-being (PWB) in young adults. The study applies a mixed-method design that combines means-end analysis and regression analysis to examine data collected from laddering interviews with 161 <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> users. The means-end chain analysis provided knowledge of the hierarchical goal structure in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> (i.e., activitiesmediated goalsultimate goals). Regression analysis was used to identify the relationships between the ultimate goals of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> use (e.g., psychological stability, belongingness) and the dimensions of PWB (e.g., self-acceptance, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>). The findings explain the significant association of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> use with well-being and the dual outcomes of enjoyment (positive in SNS; negative in users lives). Prior research focused on relationships among abstract factors, but this study delivers a more specific and nuanced explanation of user behavior on SNSs by providing knowledge of how specific <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> activities relate to goals and PWB.</p>

The sample consisted of 441 adolescents in physical education classes aged between 12 and 16 (Mage = 14.74, SD = .80), who responded to various questionnaires on perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support, motivation in the education and leisure contexts, and intention to do exercise. The model was tested using a structural equation model. The results of structural equation modeling [χ2 (48, N = 441) = 489,69, p = .001, χ2/d.f = 3.98, CFI = .94, IFI = .94, TLI = .93, RMSEA = .08] marked that perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support from the teacher was positively relacionated with intrinsic motivation in physical education classes, which in turn was positively associated with intrinsic motivation in leisure time. Perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support from family and peers was positively associated with motivation in leisure time, which in turn positively associated with the attitude and control standards. While the intention to practice physical activity was positively associated with the main concepts of the theory of planned behavior. Results are discussed in view of the importance of considering the importance of social models in the stage of adolescence, highlighting the role of promoting <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and their influence on inter-contextual motivation in physical exercise.</p>

<p>The twenty-first century higher education sector has come a long way after undergoing continuous metamorphosis from pedagogy to andragogy. Most of the educational approaches adopted in medical schools are directed towards developing more of competencies and less of capability, which is the ability to use competencies in novel contexts. Competencies alone are not sufficient to thrive in the present day work place as medical profession subsumes complex contexts; it is in this scenario that, medical educators are entrusted with the challenging task of developing “capable learners”. In the heutagogical approach, learners are required to decide upon what to learn and how to learn and therefore the control of the learning process is on the learner and the role of the teacher becomes that of a navigator. This paper highlights the current higher educational practices based on heutagogy, considers its application in the context of Problem-based learning and also discusses a few challenges in incorporating this approach in the existing undergraduate medical curriculum. The article proposes the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> in order to support learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, which in turn improves learners’ cognitive engagement with content and tasks, thereby assisting the development of attributes associated with capability.</p>

<p>Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of this paper is to explore the ways to encourage members in QQ knowledge-communication groups to persistently share knowledge in terms of contexts and autonomous motivations.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach</p>
<p>Based on self-determination theory, three important contextual factors of QQ knowledge-communication groups were selected as exogenous variables and three typical autonomous motivations as mediating variables to construct a knowledge-sharing model. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> questionnaire surveys and data collection were conducted to test proposed hypotheses by means of structural equation modeling with AMOS.</p>
<p>Findings</p>
<p>Reciprocity, learning, and altruism have significant positive influence on persistent sharing willingness, and the degree to which each factor influences persistent sharing willingness differs considerably. <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> support, perceived usefulness, and relatedness support have no significantly direct influence on persistent sharing willingness, but they indirectly influence the persistent sharing behaviors by the mediating effect of different autonomous motivations.</p>
<p>Originality/value</p>
<p>This study contributes theoretically and practically. First, the results suggest that a particular motivation in different contexts has a different degree of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. In addition, explanations are offered for the phenomenon that suggest that controlled motivations directly affect autonomous motivations. It was found that the contextual factors of competence support and relatedness support also have influence on different autonomous motivations, and hence encourage knowledge-sharing behaviors. Specific suggestions for QQ group managers and information seekers are proposed.</p>

<p>With the increasing penetration of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> in India, citizen journalism has experienced a steady growth in recent years. This paper adds to the growing scholarship on citizen journalism by exploring the motivations of Indian citizen journalists to produce online news content. Through a Web-based survey of citizen journalists (N = 134) contributing to the leading news portals in India, this study addresses the role of traditional media experience among citizen journalists’ reporting practices. One of the key findings of this study is that, unlike American citizen journalists, Indian citizen journalists who have not worked in traditional media are less likely to work collaboratively than those with traditional media experience.</p>

<p>In times of demographic change, skill shortage and disruptive innovations, organizational knowledge management and innovative capacity are the key to a company’s success. But how can knowledge be retained with fast staff turnover, global project-based work and parental leaves? Using enterprise <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> to improve knowledge dissemination at work seems promising, when looking at the success of private <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s. In this article we combine ten different empirical studies which investigated different aspects of how user diversity influences the motivation to use <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> at work. The emerging meta-study using the DerSimonian—Laird method (total sample size <span class="math display">\[N=522\]</span>N=522) analyzes different aspects of user diversity and their correlation with eight motives for SNS usage: information, importance, contact, self-presentation, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, social comparison, and power and control. We found that that the individual achievement motivation correlates positively with the motives importance, power, information and self-presentation. The need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> correlates with openness to new experiences and the need for social comparison with gender and neuroticism. From our findings, we derive practical implications for designing a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span> for work which fulfills the users’ needs and functions along their motivation.</p>

<p>Tourists increasingly rely on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>-based, autonomous resources to gather information, book, and pay for their trips; this increasing <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> may affect their overall satisfaction. Using data about how Spanish tourists search for information and complete their bookings, this study analyzes the influence of tourist <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> on overall satisfaction with the trip, as well as the effects of moderating characteristics related to both tourists and their trips. The results indicate a direct relationship between tourists’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and their overall satisfaction, as well as positive moderating effects of tourists’ previous travel experience and education, but negative moderating effects of trip complexity.</p>

<p>Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of this paper is to establish the relationship between psychological empowerment (PE) and four variables: <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, openness, superior-subordinate relationship (SSR), and climate of innovation (CI). The paper also aims to establish the mediating effects of SSR and CI on PE.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach</p>
<p>The sample size for the study was 319 employees (197 managers and 122 team leaders) from ten leading <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y companies of India. Structural equation modelling was used to test the model under study. Bootstrapping was applied to provide better estimation of the sample.</p>
<p>Findings</p>
<p>The exogenous variables under study were <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and openness. The mediating variables were SSR and CI. Results supported the model and indicated a significant direct effect between exogenous variables and PE. The role of SSR and CI as mediator was also ascertained.</p>
<p>Practical implications</p>
<p>The paper highlights that the managers of service organisations should take initiatives to provide a conducive climate for innovation. Having the right climate for innovation and support from superiors will make employees feel psychologically empowered.</p>
<p>Originality/value</p>
<p>Although as researchers and as practitioners the authors understand the importance of innovation climate and role of superior, few studies have sought to explain the mediating effects of SSR and CI.</p>

<p>In the past few years, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> has changed the ways that health seekers seek health information. However, despite the tremendous growth of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> applications in the health-care industry, trust is still among the biggest challenges for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> health services in gaining greater acceptance. Drawn from previous literature on self-determination theory, social support, and trust, this study investigates people’s intentions to seek health-information on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. The authors carefully selected a sample from Italy with subjects who already had experience in seeking health information on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. The empirical results show that informational support, emotional support, and the satisfaction of people’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and relatedness needs play an important role through trust in influencing people’s health-information-seeking intentions on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. This study is among the first to adopt the theories of self-determination, social support, and trust to investigate people’s intentions to seek health information on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>.</p>

<p>In order to secure organizational sustainability in a rapidly changing environment, it is necessary to implement a decentralized and flexible work environment. In such work environments, normally individuals are provided with <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and independence in performing tasks, thus allowing them to further engage in their given work. This study investigated task antecedents of work engagement, and further explored the process of how task characteristics affect work engagement. It focused on examining the mediating effect of role ambiguity on the task characteristics-work engagement relationship and the moderating effect of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) presenteeism on the task characteristics–role ambiguity relationship through multiple regression analyses and a bootstrapping procedure on survey data collected from 202 South Korean employees. It found that task interdependence and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> were negatively associated with role ambiguity. Of the two task characteristics, only task interdependence had a negative relationship with role ambiguity, and this relationship was significantly moderated by ICT presenteeism such that the negative association between task interdependence and role ambiguity was more pronounced when ICT presenteeism was high than when it was low.</p>

<p>Abstract <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social media</span> environments can transform and reinforce life experiences, influencing self-concept and providing happiness. The goal of this research is to examine <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> networking as an experiential phenomenon, wherein consumers pursue virtual happiness by satisfying the self-determination theory (SDT) needs of relatedness, competence, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Beginning with the memory connection to self-concept, the study proposes an experiential outcome circle for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> to virtual happiness. A circle depicts the idea that self-concept motivates <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> behavior, which influences the self-concept. Happiness, or affect balance, is a potential outcome of this connection. The study analyzes n&nbsp;=&nbsp;504 <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> networking participants using generational cohorts with fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). This study suggests the metaphors for each generation based on the following SDT recipes: (1) “we” for generation Y with relatedness and competence, (2) “me” for generation X, with <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and competence, and (3) “be” for baby boomers with competence.</p>

<p>The impact of work-related <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use on organizational and private life is a&nbsp;current research topic in work and organizational psychology. In this study, we investigate the day-level effects of work-related <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use during non-work time on employees’ psychological well-being. Drawing on the Limited Strength Model of Self-Control, we propose that work-related <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use depletes limited regulatory resources and thus, impairs well-being at the day-level. Furthermore, based on arguments brought up by Self-Determination Theory, we propose basic need satisfaction at work as a&nbsp;buffering moderator of this relationship, arguing that for employees with high levels of basic need satisfaction work-related <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use is less depleting due to high intrinsic motivation and higher levels of energy, which support resource recovery. A&nbsp;diary study covering ten working days (N&nbsp;= 74) was conducted to test our hypotheses. Results indicate that, in line with our expectations, work-related <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use impairs employees’ psychological well-being at the day-level. The satisfaction of basic psychological needs at work (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence and relatedness) can buffer these effects and thus, protect employees from impairments of well-being. Practical relevance: Technological innovations such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s allow employees to work anywhere, at any time, thus blurring the lines between different life domains and endangering employees’ well-being. Our study suggests different practical interventions to prevent such impairments of well-being for both organizations and individuals.</p>

<p>Prior research indicates that many people wish to limit aspects of their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use. Why is it that certain <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use feels so meaningless? We examined this question by using interviews, the experience sampling method, and mobile logging of 86,402 sessions of app use. One motivation for use (habitual use to pass the time) and two types of use (entertainment and passive <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>) were associated with a lower sense of meaningfulness. In interviews, participants reported feeling a loss of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> when using their phone in these ways. These reports were corroborated by experience sampling data showing that motivation to achieve a specific purpose declined over the course of app use, particularly for passive <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and entertainment usage. In interviews, participants pointed out that even when <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use itself was meaningless, it could sometimes still be meaningful in the context of broader life as a ‘micro escape’ from negative situations. We discuss implications for how mobile apps can be used and designed to reduce meaningless experiences.</p>

<p>ABSTRACTThe current study examined the role of parental media mediation styles in the relationships between (1) pro<span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> content and the performance of prosocial behavior and (2) anti<span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> content and the performance of antisocial behavior. The results of a cross-sectional survey (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;475; Mage&nbsp;=&nbsp;14.6) indicated that <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive restrictive mediation was positively related to prosocial behavior through increased pro<span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> exposure, while it was also associated with less antisocial behavior through decreased anti<span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> content exposure. <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span>-supportive active mediation on the other hand strengthened the positive association between exposure to pro<span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> content and the performance of prosocial behavior. However, this type of mediation did not moderate the association between exposure to anti<span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> content and the performance of antisocial behavior. These results indicate that <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive mediation styles are most effective in managing media effects,…</p>

<p>Abstract Research has revealed that the push to engage in video games is in part the perception that they satisfy three basic psychological needs (competence, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, relatedness). However, the pull toward a problematic style of video game engagement based on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> Gaming Disorder symptomatology has been found to be explained in part by the daily frustration of these same needs. Currently, these two areas of gaming research have been conducted within separate studies. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to bridge these two theoretically compatible areas of research in exploring the interaction between gaming need satisfaction and daily need frustration in explaining problem video game use and gaming frequency. An online sample of 922 adults (59.1% males; Mage = 23.53 years; SD = 6.84) were recruited. Results revealed both gaming need satisfaction and daily need frustration positively contributed to gaming frequency and problem video game use accounting for 19.7% and 23.5% of their respective variances. Furthermore, gaming frequency and problem video game use were highest when both gaming need satisfaction and daily need frustration were high. The implications of these results are discussed within the context of current research and strengths-based clinical approaches.</p>

<p>The paper develops a needs–affordances–features (NAF) perspective on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use which posits that individuals’ psychological needs motivate their use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> applications to the extent to which these applications provide affordances that satisfy these needs. Our theoretical development builds upon two psychological theories, namely self-determination and psychological ownership, to identify five psychological needs (needs for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, relatedness, competence, having a place, and self-identity), that we posit are particularly pertinent to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use. According to NAF, these psychological needs will motivate use of those <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> applications that provide salient affordances to fulfill these needs. We identify such affordances through a comprehensive review of the literature and of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> applications and put forth propositions that map the affordances to the psychological needs that they fulfill. Our theory development generates important implications. First, it has implications for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> research in that it provides an overarching comprehensive framework for the affordances of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> as a whole and the related psychological needs that motivate their use. Future studies can leverage NAF to identify psychological needs motivating the use of specific <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> sites based on the affordances the sites provide, and design science research can leverage NAF in the design and bundling of specific <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> features to engage users. Second, it has implications for technology acceptance research in that NAF can enrich existing models by opening up the mechanisms through which psychological needs influence user perceptions of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and their use patterns and behaviors. Finally, NAF provides a new lens and common vocabulary for future studies, which we hope can stimulate cumulative research endeavors to develop a comprehensive framework of information systems affordances in general and the psychological needs that information systems satisfy.</p>

<p>A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted of the techniques used to promote psychological need satisfaction and motivation within health interventions based on self-determination theory (SDT; Ryan &amp; Deci, 2017. Self-determination theory: Basic psychological needs in motivation, development, and wellness. New York, NY: Guilford Press). Eight databases were searched from 1970 to 2017. Studies including a control group and reporting pre- and post-intervention ratings of SDT-related psycho<span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>tors (namely perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support, need satisfaction and motivation) with children or adults were included. Risk of bias was assessed using items from the Cochrane risk of bias tool. 2496 articles were identified of which 74 met inclusion criteria; 80% were RCTs or cluster RCTs. Techniques to promote need supportive environments were coded according to two established taxonomies (BCTv1 and MIT), and 21 SDT-specific techniques, and grouped into 18 SDT based strategies. Weighted mean effect sizes were computed using a random effects model; perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support g = 0.84, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> g = 0.81, competence g = 0.63, relatedness g = 0.28, and motivation g = 0.41. One-to-one interventions resulted in greater competence satisfaction than group-based (g = 0.96 vs.&nbsp;0.28), and competence satisfaction was greater for adults (g = 0.95) than children (g = 0.11). Meta-regression analysis showed that individual strategies had limited independent impact on outcomes, endorsing the suggestion that a need supportive environment requires the combination of multiple co-acting techniques.</p>

<p>The need for a better understanding of the risk factors underpinning disordered gaming has been consistently emphasized. Although, gaming may offer a simple and straightforward means of alleviating distress, relying on gaming to address one’s unmet psychological needs could invite problematic usage. Self-determination theory highlights the significance of three universally inherent psychological needs for relatedness, competency, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. A motivation to engage in gaming may be to address unmet needs and may become problematic.This study aimed to assess whether experienced levels of loneliness, depression and self-esteem mediate the association between <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> Gaming Disorder (IGD) behaviours and Need-Fulfilment deficits.The participants comprised of 149 adults (83 males, 66 females), aged between 18 and 62 years. A series of self-reported questionaries assessing their levels of IGD behaviours, depression, loneliness, self-esteem and need-fulfilment were completed.Need-fulfilment deficits were linked to higher IGD behaviours. Interestingly, this association was mediated by the reported levels of self-esteem and depression and not loneliness.The findings lend further empirical support for the mediating role of psychological distress between need fulfilment deficits and IGD behaviours.</p>

<p>Abstract Although increasing numbers of employees working in public organizations are using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> for work purposes and numerous studies exist on how <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> affect organizational outcomes, we have very limited knowledge of how using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> for work purposes affects employees’ work motivation. This paper fills this important gap by using self-determination theory (SDT) to analyze how the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> for work purposes is associated with government employees’ need satisfaction and intrinsic work motivation. According to regression results, employees’ use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> is positively related to employees’ need satisfaction (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, relatedness, and competence) and, accordingly, intrinsic work motivation. However, further analysis shows that too much use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> has an averse effect. Theoretically, this study is one of the pioneer attempts to integrate e-governance with SDT. Practically, we encourage managers to use caution in promoting the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> for work purposes. Using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> two to three days a week may be the ideal range.</p>

<p>Exposure to ideal body types in the media has been consistently linked to reduced body satisfaction. Images posted on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s may also impact body satisfaction by portraying idealised standards of physical attractiveness promoted by peers. This study draws on self-determination theory to examine whether satisfaction of basic psychological needs (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness) protects against the negative effect of viewing <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> images depicting an ideal body type on body satisfaction. Female (n = 141) and male (n = 48) university students were randomly assigned to view either a body-ideal image or a travel image presented on a mock <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> profile. Viewing body-ideal imagery resulted in significantly lower body satisfaction compared to viewing travel imagery (d = -0.37). Satisfaction of the needs for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and competence predicted higher baseline body satisfaction; however, none of the psychological needs protected against the negative effect of viewing body-ideal imagery on body satisfaction. Limitations included brief exposure to a single <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> image and use of a convenience sample. Future research may benefit from measuring body image-specific rather than general psychological need satisfaction to predict state changes in body satisfaction.</p>

<p>Abstract The benefit of reviewing personal feedback to students’ learning of clinical communication skills is well researched. Less is known about the factors that related to students’ engagement in reviewing non-compulsory online feedback, and ways to motivate their behavioural engagement. In this paper, we reported two studies in which medical students completed assessed clinical video conferencing consultations with human simulated patients via an online training platform that also provided automated and human feedback for students. In Study 1, three days after the consultation, an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> with different instructional styles (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive, controlling or control) was sent to different groups reminding students to review their feedback. In Study 2, up to three repetitions of the same, either <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive or controlling, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s were sent to students. Results of Study 1 revealed that students who reviewed feedback before receiving <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s achieved higher assessment results and reported higher degree of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to participate in the training program than the remaining students. However, the different instructional styles of the single <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> in this study did not significantly influence the students’ engagement differently. Study 2 results revealed that students who received controlling <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s displayed higher engagement than students who received <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s. Findings suggested that multiple factors might influence students’ engagement in reviewing their online feedback, and this study provided evidences of the effects of using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s to motivate students to review the feedback.</p>

<p>The purpose of this paper is to analyze the relationship between researchers’ <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> (SM) behavior and their academic performance.,A sample of 362 researchers was recruited from the colleges of management of 52 Chinese universities. A factor analysis of eight indices retrieved from the 362 data items was conducted. A total of 24 Chinese researchers were interviewed and given a robust test.,The results indicate that Chinese general <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> (GSM) is insufficient to support academic research and it is difficult for scholars to enhance the visibility of their academic performance using GSM platforms, which can actually induce addiction. University resources, management systems, and working environment affect how scholars apply SM.,The authors examined the researchers’ SM behavior by giving them a questionnaire and interview; however, this approach proved inadequate. The academic performance of researchers is affected by numerous factors, but the authors only considered SM behavior.,It is suggested that universities apply academic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> (ASM) indicators to measure researchers’ contributions so that they self-regulate their SM usage attitudes. Also, universities should also promote ASM platforms.,This study analyzed scholars’ GSM usage and academic performance, and the moderating effect of university level on the relationship between need for competence and relatedness and need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. This comprehensive analysis contributes to the scholarly SM usage literature.</p>

<p>Abstract We develop a mediation model to explain the relationship between attachment and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social Networking Site</span> (SNS) addiction. Drawing upon the Needs-Affordances-Features model, we investigate the mediating role of satisfaction of the innate psychological needs that are salient in the SNS context (i.e., need for relatedness, need for self-presentation, and need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>). Based on an empirical study of 314 daily <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> users, results reveal distinct effects of attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance on SNS addiction through the satisfaction of different psychological needs. Satisfaction of the need for relatedness and the need for self-presentation mediates the positive relationship between attachment anxiety and SNS addiction. Satisfaction of these needs also mediates the negative relationship between attachment avoidance and SNS addiction. Satisfaction of the need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> mediates the positive relationship between attachment avoidance and SNS addiction. We conclude the study with the implications for research and practice.</p>

<p>Abstract A growing body of research has examined the relations of dispositions toward <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) to science achievement among adolescent students. However, there is little research exploring the associations between ICT-related dispositions and science-related dispositions among adolescent students. Therefore, this study, employing a self-determination theory perspective, investigated the relationships of perceived competence in ICT usage and perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> related to ICT usage with dispositions toward science—enjoyment of science, interest in broad science topics, science self-efficacy, and epistemological beliefs about science—among 258,192 adolescent students from 10,767 schools in 42 PISA 2015 participating countries. Results of multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) analyses, after accounting for student-, school-, and country-level demographic characteristics, indicated that students’ perceived competence in ICT usage and perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> related to ICT usage were significantly positively related to their enjoyment of science, interest in broad science topics, science self-efficacy, and epistemological beliefs about science. Further, the results of the study revealed that students’ perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> related to ICT usage was more strongly associated with their dispositions toward science than perceived competence in ICT usage. Implications of the findings for policy and practice are discussed.</p>

<p>Abstract Applying psychological reactance theory (PRT) as a theoretical framework, this study investigates reactance-related factors to better understand why consumers avoid advertising on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>. An online survey was conducted to develop and empirically test a conceptual model that integrates the antecedents and outcomes of reactance against <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> newsfeed ads. Specifically, the study employs <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> users’ perceptions of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, freedom threat, and intrusiveness as antecedents of reactance and measures two sub-constructs of reactance: negative cognitions and anger. As the outcomes of reactance, two types of ad avoidance are examined: cognitive and behavioral. The major findings reveal that users’ perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> decreases their perceptions of ad intrusiveness. Subsequently, ad intrusiveness and freedom threat to use <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> have a positive effect on reactance, which influences ad avoidance. Theoretical and managerial implications are also discussed.</p>

<p>While many <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> users experience social pressure to be available, only some perceive this as a burden. It was hypothesized that this form of social pressure is especially detrimental when it reduces self-control and hinders need satisfaction. Study 1 experimentally tested whether the fulfillment of intrinsic needs (i.e., <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness) in mobile communication mediates these associations. Results show that social pressure negatively affected <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and competence, but did not influence relatedness. Repeated-measures data from Study 2 suggest that social pressure leads to self-control failure, which is associated with reduced competence. This research is the first to develop and test a theoretical model of the effects of social pressure to be available on self-control, need satisfaction, and individuals’ well-being.</p>

<p>The present study investigated the factor structure of and measurement invariance in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) engagement construct, and the relationship between ICT engagement and students’ performance on science, mathematics and reading in China and Germany. Samples were derived from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2015 survey. Configural, metric and scalar equivalence were found in a multigroup exploratory structural equation model. In the regression model, a significantly positive association between interest in ICT and student achievement was found in China, in contrast to a significantly negative association in Germany. All achievement scores were negatively and significantly correlated with perceived ICT competence scores in China, whereas science and mathematics achievement scores were not predicted by scores on ICT competence in Germany. Similar patterns were found in China and Germany in terms of perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in using ICT and social relatedness in using ICT to predict students’ achievement. The implications of all the findings were discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]</p>

<p>The prevalence of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying among adolescents is globally on the rise. This study examined how general and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-specific parenting styles impact the prevalence of young adolescents’ involvement in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying as victims and/or perpetrators.One hundred and eighty 7th and 8th-grade Israeli students participated (Mean age = 13.25, SD = 0.81; 86 males, 89 females, 5 did not indicate gender). Adolescents reported the frequency of their involvement in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying, and whether their parents were using “<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive” or “psychologically controlling” strategies generally and specifically when mediating <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> use.A controlling parenting-style as well as an inconsistent <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>-mediation style were associated with a higher prevalence of adolescent involvement in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying as victims and as perpetrators. Prevalence was higher when parents who generally use a controlling style were less controlling or consistent when mediating <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> use.Despite the caveats related to parental control, parents who generally use a controlling style should consistently use this style while mediating <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>. Inconsistent parenting style conveys messages concerning <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> activities that contradict what teens are accustomed to receiving in other contexts. This inconsistency may encourage them to exploit their relative freedom in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> context and act irresponsibly.</p>

<p>Purpose There is an on-going debate about the role of workplace <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> leisure (WIL) and whether it is a vice or virtue. Considering this, the purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of WIL on workplace outcome variables such as employee satisfaction (ES) and employee productivity in the Malaysian context. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire that yielded 282 responses. Partial least square technique using SmartPLS-3 was used to test the study hypotheses. Findings Findings reveal that workplace WIL, workplace WIL policy and workplace <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> orientation (WAO) affect employees’ satisfaction. Additionally, the mediating role of ES was found to be significant. Practical implications The findings of this study are valuable for both managers and policy makers. These results can benefit the managers of conventional banks in Malaysia to decide how to enhance employees’ satisfaction and productivity by focusing on the key drivers such as WIL, workplace <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> leisure policy (WILP) and WAO. Originality/value This is a pioneering study which suggests that moderate use of WIL can have a positive and significant effect on workplace outcome variables. Moreover, this study theorised ES as a mediating variable; this helps to explain how organisations can transform workplace resources in term of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> leisure, WILP and WAO into high productivity by elevating employees’ satisfaction.</p>

<p>Background Current health care systems are rarely designed to meet the needs of people living with chronic conditions. However, some patients and informal caregivers are not waiting for the health care system to redesign itself. These individuals are sometimes referred to as e-patients. The first generation of e-patients used the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> for finding information and for communicating with peers. Compared with the first generation, the second generation of e-patients collects their own health data and appears to be more innovative. Objective The aim of this study was to describe the second generation of e-patients through exploration of their active engagement in their self-care and health care. Methods Semistructured interviews were conducted with 10 patients with chronic conditions and 5 informal caregivers. They were all recruited through a Web-based advertisement. Data were analyzed according to the framework analysis approach, using the 3 concepts of the self-determination theory—<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, relatedness, and competence—at the outset. Results Study participants were actively engaged in influencing their self-care and the health care system to improve their own health, as well as the health of others. This occurred at different levels, such as using their own experience when giving presentations and lectures to health care professionals and medical students, working as professional peers in clinical settings, performing self-tracking, contributing with innovations, and being active on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. When interaction with health care providers was perceived as being insufficient, the participants sought support through their peers, which showed strong relatedness. Competence increased through the use of technology and learning experiences with peers. Their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> was important but was sometimes described as involuntary and to give up was not an option for them. Conclusions Like the first generation of e-patients, the participants frequently searched for Web-based information. However, the second generation of e-patients also produce their own health data, which they learn from and share. They also engage in the innovation of digital tools to meet health-related needs. Utilizing technological developments comes naturally to the second generation of e-patients, even if the health care system is not prepared to support them under these new circumstances.</p>

<p>Prosocial violent media (e.g., media that combines both violent and prosocial content) is especially popular in entertainment media today. However, it remains unclear how parental media monitoring is associated with exposure to prosocial violent content and adolescent behavior. Accordingly, 1,193 adolescents were asked about parental media monitoring, media content exposure, and behavior. Main findings suggest that <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> supportive restrictive monitoring was associated with lower levels of exposure to prosocial violent content, but only among older adolescents. Additionally, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> supportive restrictive monitoring was the only form of parental media monitoring associated with lower levels of violent content and higher levels of prosocial content, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> supportive active monitoring was the only parental monitoring strategy that promoted prosocial behavior via exposure to pro<span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> content. Discussion focuses on the importance of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> supportive parental monitoring, as well as the implications of parents encouraging their children to watch media with limited violent content-even if it is prosocial violent content.</p>

<p>Patient-centered communication (PCC) by healthcare professionals can contribute to enacting and facilitating patients’ self-management of chronic health conditions. This study investigates the emerging patterns of PCC that occur in an mHealth-based diabetes prevention program for older adults. The analysis of user-coach communication data during the 16-week period of the program revealed four PCC strategies employed by coaches: (a) triggering reflections on users’ routinized habits, (b) jointly determining a measurable health goal, (c) facilitating self-evaluations on recent behavior change, and (d) tailoring programs to adapt to users’ lifestyle and health status. To advance these strategies, coaches utilized various mHealth features that helped them (a) engage in data-driven coaching, (b) increase situational awareness of users’ health conditions and routines, (c) provide continuous support to users through regular and spontaneous in-app <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>s, and (d) foster user <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and engagement. The findings extend implications for developing technology-enabled healthcare practice to enhance self-management of chronic illness.</p>

<p>Purpose This research sheds light on behavioral change by demonstrating the transformative power of a brand on the process of eating behavioral change. The selected brand is Three Times a Day (a culinary blog whose mission is to encourage a healthier diet). This study aims to identify food-related behavioral changes as a result of consumers’ relationship with this brand and identify antecedents to such changes. Design/methodology/approach A netnography of the brand <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>y and 14 individual in-depth interviews were conducted. Findings Netnography results identify four categories of behavioral changes emerging from the relationship with the brand (e.g.&nbsp;choosing healthier/more varied foods, developing an interest in cooking and adopting a healthier lifestyle). Analysis of the individual interviews substantiate the role of brand attachment as a driver of positive change and identify three antecedents: brand-self connection (through past, actual and ideal self), brand exposure and satisfaction of individual needs (i.e.&nbsp;<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence and relatedness). Research limitations/implications Results enrich the literature on behavioral change and highlight the positive role of a brand in the context of improving eating habits. Findings extend the understanding of the consequences of attachment beyond its influence at the attitudinal level by focusing on concrete consumer behavior. Social implications It is recognized that despite good intentions, individuals keep making poor food choices. This important issue is associated with several diseases and increasing social costs. This research explores how to influence consumers in adopting better eating habits. Originality/value This study is one of the first to examine the power of a food-related brand to enhance positive eating practices and improve diet.</p>

<p>Based on the biopsychosocial model of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction, this study tested a moderated mediation model of familial (i.e., perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive parenting), psychological (i.e., need satisfaction) and biological (i.e., baseline respiratory sinus arrhythmia, RSA) factors to investigate how they jointly impact <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction in emerging adults; specifically, we explored whether RSA moderated the mediating effect of need satisfaction on the relation between perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive parenting and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction. A total of 146 Chinese undergraduates completed questionnaires on <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive parenting, need satisfaction and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction. RSA data were also obtained. Path analysis was used to test the proposed mediation and moderated mediation models. The results indicated that while the impact of perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive parenting on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction was mediated by need satisfaction, RSA moderated this indirect effect. The indirect effect of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive parenting on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction via need satisfaction was much stronger in adults with low levels of RSA than in those with high levels of RSA. Our findings highlight the joint impact of biological, psychological, and social-environmental factors on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction and have important implications for the prevention of and intervention against emerging adults’ <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction.</p>

<p>Given the increasing popularity of online game playing, the negative impacts of game addiction on both adolescents and adults attracted our attention. Previous studies based on the self-determination theory have examined the effects of the three basic psychological needs of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness on problematic video game playing among Chinese young adults. Yet, as more evidence emerged pointing to the possible relation between need dissatisfaction and higher vulnerability for ill-being and psychopathology, the present study aimed to incorporate the impacts of both satisfaction and dissatisfaction for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness in explaining <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> gaming disorder (IGD), a condition that may in turn impede eudaimonic well-being as indicated by flourishing. In a self-administered online survey with a valid sample of 1200 Chinese young adults aged 18–24 years (mean age = 19.48 years), the prevalence of probable IGD (for those who reported five or more symptoms in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) symptom list for IGD) was 7.5%. Our results showed that relatedness dissatisfaction positively predicted IGD symptoms after controlling for other need satisfaction and dissatisfaction. Also, flourishing was found to be negatively predicted by IGD. Finally, IGD was found to mediate the effect of relatedness dissatisfaction on flourishing. Our findings suggested a risk factor of relatedness dissatisfaction in predicting IGD, thereby significantly predicting flourishing.</p>

<p>Customer-owned touch points have emerged as a central context for customers to consume, contribute, and create content while interacting with one another on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. Research on how firms’ attempts to intervene in such forums affect customers’ experience supremacy is still in its infancy. This study attempts to address this limitation, suggesting a framework for understanding firms’ impact on customer experience in customer-owned forums. Towards this aim, we adopt self-determination theory as a theoretical lens, and, empirically draw on interview material gleaned from customer-owned touch point users. The results show that companies’ attempt to control the discussions in such forums may have a negative impact on customers’ experiences when it undermines their sense of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, relatedness, and competence. However, firms’ intervention is welcome when the intention is to add value, enabling customers to retain or enhance their feeling of self-efficacy and social esteem.</p>

<p>Background: Behavioral addiction (BA) is a recent concept in psychiatry. Few studies have investigated the relationship between BA and early maladaptive schemas (EMSs). EMS is the core of Schema Therapy (ST). According to the ST model, psychiatric disorders result from the developmentof EMSs in response to unmet emotional needs in childhood. Bach and colleagues (2018) grouped the 18 EMSs in four domains: 1) disconnection and rejection; 2) impaired <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and performance; 3) excessive responsibility and standards; and 4) impaired limits. This study aims at assessing the possible association of the most frequent BAs with EMSs in a large group of late adolescents and young adults and to evaluate their self-perceived quality of life. Methods: A battery of psychological tests assessing food addiction (FA), gambling disorder (GD), <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> addiction (IA) and quality of life (QoL) was administered to 1,075 late adolescents and young adults (N=637; 59.3% women). A forward-stepwise logistic regression model was run to identify which variables were associated with behavioral addictions. Results: FA was more frequent among women and GD among men, while IA was equally distributed. Regarding the EMSs, participants with FA or IA showed significantly higher scores on all four-schema domains, whereas those with GD exhibited higher scores on impaired <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and performance and impaired limits. Besides, average scores of all domains increased with the association of 2 or more comorbid BAs. Self-perceived QoL was lower for participants with FA and IA, but not for those with GD; the presence of comorbid BAs was associated to lower PCS and MCS scores. Finally, specific EMS domains and demographic variables were associated with each BA. Conclusions: Late adolescents and young adults with FA or IA have a lower perception of their mental and physical health. The most striking result is that FA appears to be associated with the disconnection and rejection schema domain, IA with all the schema domains (except for impaired <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and performance), and GD with impaired <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and performance schema domain. In conclusion, our findings suggest that EMS should be systematically assessed during psychotherapy of patients with BAs.</p>

<p>The Interaction of Person-Affect-Cognition-Execution model (I-PACE; Brand, Young, Laier, Wolfling, &amp; Potenza, 2016) proposes that addictive behavior is the result of the interaction of multiple factors. According to I-PACE model, perceived social support (teacher <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support), self-esteem, and gratification (life satisfaction) contribute to adolescent <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use disorder (SUD) (Brand et al., 2016). However, previous studies have rarely examined the interactive effects of teacher <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support, self-esteem and life satisfaction on adolescent SUD. The present study examined these relationships using a moderated mediation model in which self-esteem played a mediating role and life satisfaction played a moderating role in the relation between teacher <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support and adolescent SUD. A sample of 1912 Chinese adolescents completed measures of teacher <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support, self-esteem, life satisfaction, and adolescent SUD. Self-esteem mediated the association between teacher <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support and adolescent SUD. In addition, the relation between teacher <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support and SUD was moderated by life satisfaction: when the effect of life satisfaction was high, teacher <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support negatively predicted adolescent SUD, whereas when the effect of life satisfaction was low, teacher <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support was positively related to adolescent SUD. These findings advance our understanding of the effect of teacher <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support, self-esteem and life satisfaction on adolescent SUD. Limitations and implications of this study are discussed, such as teacher <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support may not reduce adolescent SUD, especially when their life satisfaction is low.</p>

<p>Digital health technologies such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s present the potential for increased access to care and on-demand services. However, many patients with serious mental illnesses (eg, schizophrenia) have not been offered the digital health training necessary to fully utilize these innovative approaches. To bridge this digital divide in knowledge and skills, we created a hands-on and interactive training program grounded in self-determination theory, technology use cases, and the therapeutic alliance. This article introduces the need and theoretical foundation for and the experience of running the resulting Digital Opportunities for Outcomes in Recovery Services (DOORS) group in the setting of 2 programs: a first-episode psychosis program and a clubhouse for individuals with serious mental illness. The experience of running these 2 DOORS groups resulted in 2 publicly available, free training manuals to empower others to run such groups and adapt them for local needs. Future work on DOORS will expand the curriculum to best support digital health needs and increase equity of access to and knowledge and skills related to technology use in serious mental illness.</p>

<p>The relationship between self-control and media use is complicated. Loss of self-control capacity has been linked to generally higher levels of media use, which might represent self-regulatory failure, but could also be attempts at replenishing self-control. Indeed, self-determination theory proposes that satisfying intrinsic psychological needs (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness), for example via media use, aids the recovery of self-control. In this 2-wave survey (N = 395), we examined the interplay of users’ self-control capacity and their perceived satisfaction of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness needs via media use and alternative leisure activities. Satisfaction of intrinsic needs during leisure activities increased self-control capacity at the end of the evening. Feelings of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and competence during TV and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use, and competence during socializing, positively contributed to greater self-control. However, respondents with less self-control capacity before primetime experienced less intrinsic need satisfaction while engaged with TV, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, reading, sports, and socializing, diminishing self-control at bedtime.

<p>Marketers commonly seed information about products and brands through individuals believed to be influential on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, which often involves enlisting micro influencers, users who have accumulated thousands as opposed to millions of followers (i.e., other users who have subscribed to see that individual’s posts). Given an abundance of micro influencers to choose from, cues that help distinguish more versus less effective influencers on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> are of increasing interest to marketers. The authors identify one such cue: the number of users the prospective influencer is following. Using a combination of real-world data analysis and controlled lab experiments, they show that following fewer others, conditional on having a substantial number of followers, has a positive effect on a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> user’s perceived influence. Further, the authors find greater perceived influence impacts engagement with the content shared in terms of other users exhibiting more favorable attitudes toward it (i.e., likes) and a greater propensity to spread it (i.e., retweets). They identify a theoretically important mechanism underlying the effect: following fewer others conveys greater <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, a signal of influence in the eyes of others.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:lightgreen">Smartphone</span>s are omnipresent and offer real-time information on the go. Predominantly, adolescent girls have been found to be engaged in levels of physical activity (PA) below the daily recommended guideline of at least 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity, and especially during weekends. Lack of sufficient PA can lead to a risk of contracting non-communicable diseases. The purpose of this exploratory study was to investigate the efficacy of using mobile applications (app) (i.e.&nbsp;MapMyFitness [MMF]) in changing adolescent girls’ PA behaviour during weekends. It also examined the perceived benefits, challenges and recommendations for using mobile apps. Thirty-six participants aged 15 years ( M age = 14.9; SD = 0.30) from a convenience sample volunteered and took part in the present study, which spanned four weekends. Quantitative results showed a significant difference in the mean step count between experimental and control groups during week two, probably due to the novelty effect when the participants were introduced to the new MMF mobile app. Overall, the use of the MMF app seems to be able to attenuate the decline of adolescent girls’ PA level during weekends. Qualitative results revealed benefits of using mobile apps to promote PA, such as a sense of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in selecting PA, the ability to view friends’ postings of PA and self-monitoring of PA. The study revealed specific challenges to using such PA mobile apps - in particular, factors such as the cumbersome and confusing functions in the app that discouraged users from performing PA. Recommendations included allowing users to customise their accounts, simplifying the app’s functions, and including rewards and videos as motivators to enhance users’ PA experience. Although mobile apps may have the potential to encourage participation in PA, a careful selection of mobile app functions is required to engage adolescent girls to continue to use it for PA.</p>

<p>Psychological needs dissatisfaction has been identified as hindering adaptive development, in which <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> need dissatisfaction, as one core component, may be associated with adolescents’ maladaptive online behaviors. Sporadic research has examined the association between <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> need dissatisfaction and problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> use (PMPU). Boredom proneness and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> gaming were suggested to be linked to this association. This study aimed to examine the mediating effects of boredom proneness and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> gaming in the association between <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> need dissatisfaction and PMPU. A total of 358 secondary school students completed questionnaires at three waves; <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> need dissatisfaction was measured in time 1 (T1); boredom proneness and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> gaming were measured one year later (time 2, T2); PMPU was measured two years later (time 3, T3). The structural equation model results showed that T1 <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> need dissatisfaction not only directly predicted T3 PMPU, but also exerted effects via the mediating role of T2 boredom proneness and the chain mediating role of T2 boredom proneness and T2 <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> gaming. These findings reveal the unique role of specific psychological need in engaging PMPU, which provides support to targeted interventions, such that promoting <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> need satisfaction may be an instrumental procedure to prevent adolescents from addiction-like online behaviors.</p>

<p>We tested if challenges to basic psychological needs (BPN) for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness during the COVID-19 pandemic undermine people’s mental well-being. Furthermore, we tested if an intervention, affirmation of these psychological needs, enhances mental well-being. Results of Study 1 ( N = 153) showed that higher levels of satisfaction of BPN were related to higher well-being during the COVID-19 outbreak. In Study 2 ( N = 215), we employed an online intervention enhancing these BPN. We found increased mental well-being through bolstered relatedness in particular. The intervention also decreased perceived stress. Both studies showed that mental well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic is positively related to the ability to work as usual and the number of people contacted via phone or <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> but not in person.</p>

<p>The development of the information society causes a new direction of socialization – media socialization, especially it’s relevant for young people, who is an active media consumer.The essence of the notions of «media space», «media socialization», «<span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> socialization» are analyzed in the article. The features of the media space functioning are considered, taking into account the factors of socialization, its functions are represented in accordance with the traditional socialization process. The influence of the media on the socialization process is determined as a condition for the further development of the components in the youth media socialization. The principles of youth media socialization in the conditions of media space are offered (system, activity, bilateral interaction of personality and virtual reality, media activity and critical thinking). The components of the media-socialization process are presented (forms, mechanisms, agents of media-socialization, etc.). The indicators of successful and unsuccessful media socialization are indicated. The basic conflict of media socialization is determined, which affects its result (the balance of virtual and real).The media socialization criteria with corresponding levels of development and indicators is offered in the article (media adaptability, media <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, media activity). The levels of media-socialization of youth are presented in conditions of modern media space.The study of the process of youth media socialization was confirmed by the high percentage of respondents with low (38.5%) and medium (41.8%) levels of media-socialization. At the same time, the high level of media-socialization was characteristic only for 19.7% of respondents.The issue of media socialization of young people becomes acute in connection with the situation that has developed in the state. The system of social education institutions faces the challenge of initiating changes in young people entering into the media space, which in the future will create effective conditions for development taking into account media resources. The problem of youth media socialization is not limited to the research conducted. Promising areas of scientific research can be: development of socio-pedagogical conditions and technology of media-socialization of the individual; development of methodical support for the implementation of media-socialization technology in general educational institutions; introduction of foreign experience of youth media socialization into practice of social work.</p>

<p>Gaming Disorder is a recognised mental health condition with a very narrow range of treatment options. This pre-post study recruited 50 adult gamers from New Zealand to test the feasibility of a brief <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>-delivered intervention. The intervention components were derived from Implementation Intention principles whereby the gap between intention and behaviour was targeted. The intervention delivery was in accordance with Self-Determination Theory to facilitate <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (personalised goals and action plans), competence (facilitated coping plans, self-monitoring, and relapse prevention) and relatedness (access to a goal coach providing written feedback and support to implement plans). Follow-up evaluation at 3-months indicated the intervention was feasible as it demonstrated rapid recruitment, program engagement (86% used the program), and high satisfaction (easy to understand and convenient). Plans most frequently focused on behavioural substitution and lifestyle change, and the most frequent barrier to change was time management followed by social pressure. Completers (n ​= ​35) reported a significant increase in well-being and reduction in severity, intensity, and time spent gaming, which reduced from an average of 29 to 11 ​hours per week. Delivery of a brief <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>-delivered intervention shows promise and could be used to treat people experiencing problems who are unable or unwilling to access face-to-face treatment. • A brief intervention is associated with reduced gaming time and frequency, and symptom severity. • 88% of participants elected to reduce gaming, with just 12% planning abstinence. • Time management and social pressure are the most salient barriers to change. • Personalised change plans most often target substitution and lifestyle change. • Brief and focused coaching can facilitate engagement with an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>-delivered program.</p>

<p>The purpose of the study was the evaluation of a teacher in-service training program, namely “PE.T.Co.N.“, an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>y of practice via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> groups. Drawing from Self-Determination theory (SDT), the program aimed at satisfying teachers’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness needs and facilitating their autonomous motivation. Pre-post measurements showed significant improvements in key variables that can determine training success. Preliminary quantitative group insights supported by qualitative data revealed enhanced participatory dynamics in terms of members’ interaction. Findings suggest that PE.T.Co.N. is a promising, innovative approach to teacher training. Implications are discussed in light of SDT. • PE teacher in-service training can be delivered effectively as a CoP through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> groups. • <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> appears a promising tool to tackle the attrition issue in on-line training. • PETCoN participation leads/contributes to increased <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> need satisfaction. • PETCoN increases relatedness need satisfaction and decreases relatedness frustration. • Self-determination theory is well suited when designing teacher in-service training.</p>

<p>Abstract. Previous research shows that perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support is significantly associated with positive health outcomes for different clinical populations. However, there is not a standardized measurement tool that assesses perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support for the Turkish population. This study translated the Health Care Climate Questionnaire (HCCQ), a perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support measurement tool, into Turkish and investigated the factorial structure of the questionnaire with a group of patients with cancer. This study used a convenience-sampling method with 192 people with cancer. The participants were recruited from a major cancer institute and a non-profit organization in Turkey by research partners. Volunteer participants either filled out a hard copy of a survey packet or completed the survey packet through a secured online survey tool website (i.e., https://www.surveymonkey.com ). In addition, a closed <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> group for cancer survivors in Turkey was used to advertise the study’s link. The results indicated the participants perceived a moderate level of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support. In comparison to German and US populations, perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support was low among Turkish cancer patients. The results also indicated that the HCCQ has a two-factor measurement structure. Correlations with external variables indicated that the scores of HCCQ were significantly positively associated with life satisfaction and quality of life of cancer patients and negatively associated with cancer related symptoms (e.g., fatigue).</p>

<p>This interdisciplinary cross-cultural research explores antecedents for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> networking satisfaction for Spanish and American consumers. Conceptually rooted in a sense of community, self-determination theory, and Hofstede’s cultural dimensions, our descriptive study samples consist of n = 367 Americans and n = 161 Spaniards. Analysis with fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) interrogates two propositions to identify recipes. Proposition 1 indicates that <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is not a necessary ingredient for either culture; self-presentation in the virtual world need not mirror the true self to provide short-term virtual satisfaction. Proposition 2 suggests that both cultures value relatedness and competence as motivations for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> behavior. While Americans value interactivity more than their counterparts, Spaniards value competence more, to experience <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> networking satisfaction. Digital marketing managers must better understand cross-cultural differences and consider virtual value propositions offered to members of various cultures to better navigate the dynamic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> environment.</p>

<p>Purpose Although a supportive workplace is increasingly considered important for employees’ performance, much of the evidence remains speculative, for example, it lacks offsetting mechanisms. This study addresses circumstances when perceived support helps and when it hurts work performance, depending on the mediating effects of job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, intrinsic motivation and job satisfaction under the boundary conditions of perceived helpfulness of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms and felt stress. Design/methodology/approach This study collected data using a questionnaire protocol that was adapted and refined from the original scales in existing studies. The sample consists of 900 employees from the public healthcare industry in Vietnam. To test the hypotheses, the partial least squares (PLS) technique was used. Findings This study finds that job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, intrinsic motivation and job satisfaction are important for the perceived support and work performance relationship in which perceived helpfulness of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms plays a critical confounding role. The findings also confirm that felt stress negatively moderates the relationship between job satisfaction and work performance, weakening the effect job satisfaction has on employee work performance. Originality/value This study specifies the boundary conditions under which work performance is mostly affected while enhancing the understanding of how to reinforce intrinsic motivation and job satisfaction. The findings offer organizational and human resource management (HRM) scholars and practitioners a closer look at perceived helpfulness of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms and support the suggestions that <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive workplaces are superior.</p>

<p>This study investigated how older adults’ use of specific features on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> is associated with intrinsic motivation and well-being. A content analysis and an online survey were conducted with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> users older than 60 years (N = 202). Results showed that profile customization and commenting are positively associated with feelings of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and relatedness, respectively, both predictors of enjoyment on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>. Posting photos is positively associated with a feeling of competence, which is related to well-being. The findings advance knowledge about the theoretical mechanisms underlying effects of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> use on well-being, and provides design recommendations that address older users’ needs.</p>

<p>Working life has digitalized considerably in recent decades and organizations have taken into use new forms of collaborative technologies such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms. This study examined the relationship between <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use at work and well-being at work for millennials and members of former generations in Finland. The research data contained focus group interviews (N = 52), an expert organization survey (N = 563), and a nationally representative survey (N = 1817). Well-being measures included technostress, burnout, psychological distress, and a set of background variables. Content analysis and linear regression models were used as analysis methods. The results showed that millennials have various intrinsic and extrinsic motivations for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use at work. Intrinsic motivations included employees’ personal choice and their pure interest to follow the market and discussions in their own field. Extrinsic motivations were related mainly to organizations’ work culture and personal branding. The survey findings revealed, however, that millennials were not only more active <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> users for work, but they also experienced higher technostress and burnout than members of former generations. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social media</span> use motivations were associated with both higher and lower technostress and burnout depending on motivation, indicating that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use can have both positive and negative effects. Overall, our findings suggest that employees tend to utilize <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> more if their needs for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness are fulfilled.</p>

<p>Firms increasingly seek to use <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>ies as sources of ideas, innovations, and designs. However, many such open innovation efforts lack sustained participation and ultimately fail. This research sought to understand motivations to participate in a firm-hosted design community and how the nature of the design task influences sustained participation. From an inductive study of a leading vehicle design community, we found project variety—across two dimensions of project <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and project complexity—supported a range of motivations to participate and the social practice of vehicle design. We discuss implications of our study for research on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>ies and for firms within the global vehicle industry.</p>

<p>This study statistically analyzed survey data to examine the relationship between fulfillment of psychological needs of 223 Chinese sojourners in the United States and their online self-presentation strategies on Chinese and American <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. The results showed that the combined use of proactive and defensive self-presentation strategies on Chinese <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> instead of American <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> were more effective to fulfill the sojourners’ need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.

<p>Purpose This study aims to investigate how <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> services can improve the well-being of elderly consumers. Drawing on transformative service research (TSR) and technology adoption literature, it examines the main challenges for the elderly when adopting <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> services and how they and their family members can co-create value to improve the elderly service inclusion and well-being. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative methodology is used to identify challenges, value co-creation behaviors and well-being outcomes of elderly individuals and their family members when using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> services. The data collection method involved 24 in-depth interviews with consumers over 75 years of age and their family members. Findings This research first recognizes specific challenges for the elderly in adopting <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> services related to resistance to technology adoption and health impairments. Second, the findings identify value co-creation behaviors held by elderly consumers of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> services: learning and formal training, complying with indications and seeking help when they encounter problems with technology. Family members also contribute to elderly well-being through two value co-creation behaviors: helping and supporting elderly relatives with technology and being patient and tolerant when they need support. Finally, these behaviors are found to influence five dimensions of elderly consumers’ well-being: enjoyment, personal growth, mastery, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and social connectedness. Originality/value This study addresses a gap in the literature by exploring the value co-creation behaviors of elderly consumers of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> services and their family members for improving well-being outcomes. Understanding value co-creation and well-being for elderly consumers of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> services is an emerging and under-researched area in TSR and service inclusion literature.</p>

<p>The present study aimed to address to the dearth of research into the phenomenology of recovery among young people exposed to trauma.Using an interpretative phenomenological approach, we analyzed <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> forum data to consider how young people experience recovery from trauma.Five domains of recovery were identified: meaningful shifts in the sense of self, gaining control and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, establishing hope and commitment, making meaning out of tragedy, and engaging in normative activities and connecting with others. Participants described the experience of recovery as an ongoing, nonlinear and dialectical process that was not synonymous with cure and often took place in the context of supportive relationships.While the broad themes of recovery align with those derived from adult literature, the accounts diverge with respect to the content within the domains themselves. The findings suggest that services oriented to trauma-exposed young people need to bolster these internal processes of change, while also attending to their specific developmental needs and capacities.

<p><span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span>bullying victimization is associated with mental health problems and reported to occur more in nonheterosexual orientation youth (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and questioning (LGBQ)) than among heterosexual youth. Parental support may protect against mental health problems after being victimized, but nonsupportive parental influences may also exacerbate harm. This study investigated whether parenting dimensions (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support, psychological control) moderated the associations between bullying victimization and mental health problems among heterosexual and LGBQ adolescents. An anonymous survey was completed by 1037 adolescents (M age = 15.2 ± 1.9, 50% female). Regression analyses examined associations between victimization, sexual orientation, and mental health problems, and investigated the moderating role of parenting. Both forms of victimization were associated with higher mental health problems. LGBQ youth experienced more depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation than heterosexual youth. Lower levels of parental psychological control and higher levels of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support were related to having fewer mental health problems. However, perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support appeared less protective when adolescents experienced more frequent victimization. Moreover, parental psychological control was related to heightened risk for suicidal plans specifically among LGBQ youth and also exacerbated the association between <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying victimization and stress among LGBQ youth. These findings underscore the need to address parenting in whole-school antibullying and mental health promotion programs.</p>

<p>Purpose Online games are prevalent <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> applications and are known for satisfying the various needs of users. Nonetheless, little is known about whether online games could be a resort for users encountering workplace frustration. Explaining how workplace frustration and users’ need satisfaction affect loyalty of online gamers, this study aims to formulate hypotheses and develop a framework based on the self-determination theory (SDT). Design/methodology/approach The authors use an online survey to collect 848 responses and use structural equation modelling to test the hypotheses. Findings The authors find that workplace frustration, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> need satisfaction and competence need satisfaction are positively related to online gamer loyalty. Moreover, workplace frustration enhances the link between competence need satisfaction and online gamer loyalty. Originality/value The authors are the first to use SDT to identify the three antecedents and the moderator of online gamer loyalty. Our findings offer a key message that game providers could design effective means to retain their gamers by understanding their gamers’ workplace frustration and informing them that playing games could alleviate the associated negative feelings.</p>

<p>Purpose The emergence of mHealth applications has led to the rise of health-based services delivered over <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s. Younger people are often found to be more innovative toward technology, especially related to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s (Rai et al.&nbsp;, 2013). Most mHealth application downloaders are continually shifting between applications because of the hyper-competition making achieving loyal consumers challenging (Racherla et al.&nbsp;, 2012). The purpose of this paper is to study the determinants that help increase young consumers mHealth application loyalty. This study integrates self-determination theory (SDT), gamification elements and engagement to examine loyalty. Design/methodology/approach A valid sample of 263 college student’s data was obtained for data analysis from a survey conducted in multiple campuses of the Delhi University in India. Findings The three psychological needs: need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, need for competence and need for relatedness, showed a positive impact on intrinsic motivation. From the gamification factors; perceived playfulness, the level of challenge and social interaction, only the first two showed a positive impact on extrinsic motivation. Both motivation factors influence engagement, showing a frequent interaction with the application, leading to loyalty. Originality/value Previous studies examined the adoption of mHealth services, this study is one of the first to examine young consumers’ loyalty in using mhealth apps.

<p>This paper explores how first-year students experienced emergency online teaching during COVID-19 and aims at understanding individual experiences related to basic psychological need satisfaction, considering different levels of contextual facilitators for learning activities involving technology in higher education derived from the C-flat model. Employing a case study approach, interviews of 15 chemistry students were qualitatively analyzed. The results show negative effects of lacking <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> connectivity and concurrence of learning and home spaces but positive effects of ceased commute between home and campus. Teachers’ implementation of digital learning opportunities was perceived as adequate but did not sufficiently address the overwhelming increase in students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and decrease in social relatedness. Students’ self-regulation skills as well as skills to initiate and maintain social contacts for interactive learning activities and for motivational support emerged as crucial aspects. Many students were not able to cope appropriately and students’ need satisfaction during emergency online teaching appeared to be related to students’ prior need satisfaction resulting in five groups of students, with two being relatively resilient and three being vulnerable to the disruptions of regular onsite teaching. Implications for further research and practice are discussed. • First year students experienced overwhelming <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> during emergency online teaching. • Students struggled with maintaining social contacts for learning and motivational support. • Coping abilities are related to earlier study related psychological need satisfaction. • Lacking <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and concurrence of learning and home space are major problems. • Teaching via webinars provides structure, but interactive teaching forms are needed.</p>

<p>Serendipity refers to unexpected encounters with ideas or insights and their intentional application to achieve favorable outcomes. Despite extensive prior studies, the concept lacks theoretical logic and empirical validation regarding the role of an intentional act in the relationship between serendipitous encounters and their favorable outcomes. Drawing from self-determination theory, we develop a model that highlights the role of needs satisfaction in explaining this relationship. Positioning the empirical context to fortunate discoveries of information and social connections in professional use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span>, we validate the model by a cross-sectional survey study of 473 users. The model builds on the observation that individuals’ serendipitous encounters are associated with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span>-enabled innovation, that is, a contextualized form of task innovation. The study findings support the research model revealing that serendipitous encounters are positively associated with needs satisfaction and that needs satisfaction is positively associated with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span>-enabled innovation. In other words, fortunate discoveries of new information and contacts increase <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span> users’ intent to utilize the platform in new ways to accomplish work when the three key psychological needs of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness are satisfied.</p>

<p>Driven by the rapid pace of technical innovation in biosensing, artificial intelligence, the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things and wearable computing, the next generation of smart devices will be worn on-body, eventually becoming implanted. The increasing presence of these new forms of interactive technologies, known as biowearables , in children’s lives poses critical ethical concerns. In this position paper, we take a design ethics perspective to identify and describe four cases of ethical importance associated with biowearables, children, and long-term use. The cases concern potential negative impacts of specific aspects of biowearables on children’s identity formation, the development of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and agency , and what sources of information children turn to for authority about themselves. Drawing on ethical discourse related to emerging technologies and biowearable computing, we present prospective guidance for designers, where it is available. Where guidance is nascent or missing, we propose future research areas that could be addressed. In particular, we propose the importance of teaching children about computer ethics through hands-on critical reflection during design and technology activities. Our results will be of interest to the human–computer interaction community as well as to technology developers, educators, parents and those involved in policy formation around emerging technologies.</p>

<p>With globalization, digitalization, and the spread of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies, rules regulating work have been softened or completely abolished. Consequently, employees face additional cognitive demands to plan, structure, and coordinate their work. To capture these demands of contemporary work, we constructed and initially validated the Cognitive Demands of Flexible Work (CODE) scale. The scale comprises four subscales (i.e., structuring of work tasks, planning of working times, planning of working places, and coordinating with others). We initially validated the scale in three independent studies (overall N = 1,129) in German and English. Confirmatory factor analyses supported the four-factor structure, as well as scalar invariance, of the different language versions. Moreover, the subscales showed convergent and divergent validity with related constructs such as requirements for problem solving or <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The criterion validity for emotional exhaustion, engagement, positive work rumination, negative work rumination, and problem-solving pondering suggested that cognitive demands of flexible work can be construed as challenge demands. However, relationships with emotional exhaustion were not significant. Overall, the CODE scale was shown to be a reliable and valid instrument to measure cognitive demands of flexible work.</p>

<p>This study explored the impact of assistive technology on the well-being of legally blind adults.In this mixed-method study, a convenience sample of 86 legally blind adults took an electronic survey. The questionnaire was comprised of demographics, use patterns, and an instrument called TENS-Interface that measured the impact of technology on well-being categories of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness. Descriptive statistics, reliability, power analysis and bivariate correlations were calculated using SPSS statistical software. Three participants completed follow up semi-structured interviews, which were analysed for themes of technological mediation using NVivo 12 software.The TENS-Interface was validated for use with a legally blind population. Descriptive statistics showed a higher mean for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> than competence or relatedness. Braille was positively correlated to both <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and competence, while screen reader proficiency was related to competence. Daily use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">instant mess</span>aging, and video calls were correlated to relatedness. The technological devices used by interview participants were analysed for technological mediation. Training was identified as an additional theme.Recommendations for practice include providing training to legally blind adults in screen reader use and braille use to support well-being via competence and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Training is also recommended for this population in the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>, and video calls to promote well-being through opportunities for relatedness. Further research is recommended to explore instructional methods that are not only efficient, but also meaningful for older adults in the position of losing their vision.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONProviding access to braille instruction and braille assistive technology equipment can promote legally blind adults’ well-being by supporting their basic needs for both competence and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.Providing training in screen reader use can promote legally blind adults’ well-being by supporting their basic need for competence.Providing training in use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, video calls, and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">instant mess</span>aging can promote legally blind adults’ well-being by supporting their basic need for relatedness.A consideration of technological mediation can allow practitioners to make recommendations that take into account not only efficient task completion, but issues related to meaning and social context.Instruction for adults losing their vision adventitiously needs to address not only efficient task performance, but also meaning and social context.</p>

<p>In the COVID-19 pandemic, human solidarity plays a crucial role in meeting this maybe greatest modern societal challenge. Public health communication targets enhancing collective compliance with protective health and safety regulations. Here, we asked whether authoritarian/controlling message framing as compared to a neutral message framing may be more effective than moralizing/prosocial message framing and whether recipients’ self-rated trait <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> might lessen these effects. In a German sample (n = 708), we measured approval of seven regulations (e.g., reducing contact, wearing a mask) before and after presenting one of three <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span> messages (authoritarian, moralizing, neutral/control) presented by either a high-authority sender (state secretary) or a low-authority sender (social worker). We found that overall, the messages successfully increased participants’ endorsement of the regulations, but only weakly so because of ceiling effects. Highly autonomous participants showed more consistent responses across the two measurements, i.e., lower response shifting, in line with the concept of reactive <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Specifically, when the sender was a social worker, response shifting correlated negatively with trait <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. We suggest that a trusted sender encourages more variable responses to imposed societal regulations in individuals low in <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and we discuss several aspects that may improve health communication.</p>

<p>Exercise is an effective intervention to prevent falls in older adults; however, long-term adherence is often poor. To increase adherence, additional support for behavior change has been advocated. However, consistency in the reporting of interventions using behavior change techniques is lacking. Recently, a classification system has been developed to increase consistency in studies using behavior change techniques within the self-determination theory.This study aimed to explore expressions of self-determination among community-dwelling older adults using a self-managed digital fall prevention exercise program comprising behavior change support (the Safe Step program), which was developed in co-creation with intended users.The qualitative study design was based on open-ended responses to questionnaires, and individual and focus group interviews. A deductive qualitative content analysis was applied using the classification system of motivation and behavior change techniques as an analytical matrix, followed by an inductive analysis. Twenty-five participants took part in a feasibility study and exercised in their homes with the Safe Step program for 4 months. The exercise program was available on computers, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s, and tablets, and was fully self-managed.In the deductive analysis, expressions of support were demonstrated for all three basic human psychological needs, namely, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness. These expressions were related to 11 of the 21 motivation and behavior change techniques in the classification system. The inductive analysis indicated that <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (to be in control) was valued and enabled individual adaptations according to different rationales for realizing exercise goals. However, the experience of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> was also two-sided and depended on the participants’ competence in exercise and the use of technology. The clarity of the program and exercise videos was seen as key for support in performance and competent choices. Although augmented techniques for social support were requested, support through relatedness was found within the program.In this study, the Safe Step program supported the establishment of new exercise routines, as well as the three basic human psychological needs, with <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and competence being expressed as central in this context. Based on the participants’ experiences, a proposed addition to the classification system used as an analytical matrix has been presented.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02916849; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02916849.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>y (ICT) engagement, as a multidimensional construct, plays an increasingly important role in education. The main purpose of this research was to explore the effects of ICT engagement factors on science performance across Singapore and Turkey conditional to the sufficient degree of measurement invariance of ICT engagement scale. The multi-group confirmatory factor analysis results demonstrated strong factorial invariance of ICT engagement scale across Singapore and Turkey, so we were able to use ICT engagement scale to meaningful and valid comparisons between these countries. After obtaining measurement invariance, a multi-group structural equation modeling was used for the comparison of the effects of ICT engagement factors on student’s performance of science between these two countries. While interest in ICT, perceived ICT competence and perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in using ICT have significant positive direct effect on science performance in both countries, the direct effect of social relatedness in using ICT on science performance is negative in both Singapore and Turkey. Also, when compared with Singapore, the effects of all ICT engagement constructs on student’s performance are higher in Turkey.

<p>• An automated micro-investment service at a retail bank was modified during an RCT. • A weekly option to multiply automatic micro-investments increased them by 20-36%. • An option to make a freely chosen investment generated substantial contributions. • Treatment was similarly effective across most demographic and personality variables. Automated financial services remedy present biased financial behaviour by nudging users towards investing. Although these services increase investments, they deprive users of the experience of making prudent decisions that would satisfy their need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Assuming that freedom of choice facilitates <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, we hypothesized that the addition of an element of choice to an automated micro-investment service would increase the amounts invested. To test this idea, we randomised 825 volunteer users of a micro-investments service at an Estonian bank to receive different versions of weekly <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s offering a choice to double, quadruple, or keep the money they had accrued for investment through the service. We found that the treatment increased the average investment per participant by 20 to 36%. The effectiveness of the treatments was independent of a number of financial, socio-economic, or personality characteristics other than income. We conclude that the addition of elements of choice to automated investment services has a significant potential to increase investments and improve financial well-being.</p>

<p>Purpose The authors develop a conceptual model to examine how three basic psychological needs (i.e.&nbsp;needs for competence, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and relatedness) affect employee <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use (i.e.&nbsp;work- and social-related use). The authors propose that the need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> positively moderates the relationship between need for competence and work-related use, whereas it negatively moderates that between need for relatedness and social-related use. Design/methodology/approach To test the proposed model, 332 internal and 271 external <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> users in the workplace were recruited. Findings The results indicate that needs for competence and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and needs for relatedness and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> positively affect the work- and social-related use, respectively, of internal and external <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. Need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> positively moderates the relationship between need for competence and work-related use of internal <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, and it negatively moderates that between need for relatedness and the social-related use of internal <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. Need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> has no moderating effect on the relationship between need for competence and work-related use, whereas it negatively moderates the relationship between need for relatedness and the social-related use of external <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. Originality/value First, the authors’ findings offer significant empirical support for the different <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> uses, namely work and social related. Second, this study highlights the importance of psychological needs of employees in determining the form of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use. Third, this study empirically demonstrates the differences in psychological needs and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use between two different <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> contexts.</p>

<p>Applications using Artificial Intelligence (AI) have become commonplace and embedded in our daily lives. Much of our communication has transitioned from human-human interaction to human-technology or technology-mediated interaction. As technology is handed over control and streamlines choices and decision-making in different contexts, people are increasingly concerned about a potential threat to their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. In this paper, we explore <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> perception when interacting with AI-based applications in everyday contexts using a design fiction-based survey with 328 participants. We probed if providing users with explanations on “why” an application made certain choices or decisions influenced their perception of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> or reactance regarding the interaction with the applications. We also looked at changes in perception when users are aware of AI’s presence in an application. In the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> context, we found that people perceived a greater reactance and lower sense of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> perhaps owing to the personal and identity-sensitive nature of the application context. Providing explanations on “why” in the navigation context, contributed to enhancing their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> perception, and reducing reactance since it influenced the users’ subsequent actions based on the recommendation. We discuss our findings and the implications it has for the future development of everyday AI applications that respect human <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.</p>

<p>This study aims at exploring the influence of product design on customer engagement through self-determined needs satisfaction. This study used the survey method in three ways: (1) mall intercept approach, (2) <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> survey, and (3) survey through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Wechat</span>. The sample was collected from 500 customers of electronic products living in Xi’an, China. The data analysis is done through structural equation modeling. Findings show that perceived product design in terms of functional, esthetic, and symbolic design is positively related to self-determined needs (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, relatedness, competence) satisfaction. Furthermore, results reveal that self-determined needs satisfaction has a positive influence on customer engagement. The moderation results show that prevention focused customers moderate the relationship between functional design and self-determined needs satisfaction. Whereas, promotion focused customers moderate the relationship between esthetic design and self-determined needs satisfaction. This study adds value to the self-determination theory by examining the link between product design dimensions and customer engagement through self-determined needs satisfaction. Furthermore, this study adds value to the existing literature on regulatory focus theory.</p>

<p>Abstract International engagement has become a priority and is regarded as a means to improve the quality of students’ education and their future social and professional success. It may, however, pose a major challenge for some higher education students. One of the vulnerable groups is that of learners with special needs, and particularly Deaf, deaf and hard of hearing students. These learners are limited in their chances to interact in spoken/written foreign languages and in the learning opportunities they can join. This, by extension, has an unfavourable impact on their possibilities of engaging in study abroad. Based on the experience with a newly launched e-learning course “Online English for International Mobilities”, the present paper discusses the need for building effective FL learning strategies in Deaf, deaf and hard of hearing students in connection with the process of academic internationalisation. The main argument is for the need to foster students’ ability to self-regulate, reduce their teacher dependency and reliance on directed learning, and to encourage them to take responsibility for their own learning. Secondly, the paper provides a comparison of two pilot runs of the course from the perspective of (online) classroom dynamics and cooperation. While the course is built to be as autonomous as possible and benefits from the advantages of the e-learning format, great importance is given to group dynamics and cooperation via discussion forums and online <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>s. It also takes advantage of the considerable benefits of individualized, personalized feedback being provided by teachers on selected assignments.</p>

<p>We explore the benefits and costs of social networking usage and examine the roles of need to belong and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to contextualize the fear of missing out (FoMO) socio-cultural phenomenon in the digital age. We utilize a self-determination theory-based framework for understanding how the FoMO phenomenon influences positive (negative) mood, information overload, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> satisfaction, and engagement with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> advertising. Study 1 explores how FoMO relates to positive mood through the need to belong. Study 2 demonstrates how FoMO impacts information overload through the mediation of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> interactivity. Furthermore, Study 2 shows how FoMO alters <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> satisfaction, and this relationship is mediated by information overload and moderated by <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Study 3 shows that negative emotions serve to mediate the effect of information overload on engagement with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> advertising. Finally, we discuss implications of this study to provide insight into how brand marketers can offer FoMO-reducing mechanisms to consumers to ensure a high level of advertising engagement, how health advocates can leverage <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> to promote meaningful engagement with consumers, and how industry practitioners may want to consider aspirational virtual events to create buzz while also satisfying consumers’ need to belong to social groups.</p>

<p>Rapid advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) are transforming customer service by making it possible to create <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bot applications that can understand users’ intents and response in a human-like manner. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Chat</span>bots promise to enhance customer experiences by creating more personal customer interactions than those afforded by traditional menu-based web applications. But are <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots always superior to more traditional user interfaces (UI)? This study seeks to understand the differences in user satisfaction with a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bot system vis-a-vis a menu-based interface system, and identify factors that influence user satisfaction. Grounded in the self-determination theory, the research model proposed here focuses on the effect of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bot use on perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, perceived competence, cognitive load, performance satisfaction, and system satisfaction. An experimental study was conducted, and data were analyzed using Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling. The findings indicate that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bot systems lead to a lower level of perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and higher cognitive load, compared with menu-based interface systems, resulting in a lower degree of user satisfaction. Implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed. • <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Chat</span>bot are associated with a lower level of perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and higher cognitive load, compared with menu interface. • Perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and perceived competence have a significant effect on performance satisfaction and system satisfaction. • Perceived competence was a stronger predictor of performance satisfaction. • Perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> was a stronger predictor of system satisfaction. • Perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> positively influences perceived competence.</p>

<p>Emotion-aware <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots that can sense human emotions are becoming increasingly prevalent. However, the exposition of emotions by emotion-aware <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots undermines human <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and users’ trust. One way to ensure <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is through the provision of control. Offering too much control, in turn, may increase users’ cognitive effort. To investigate the impact of control over emotion-aware <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots on <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, trust, and cognitive effort, as well as user behavior, we carried out an experimental study with 176 participants. The participants interacted with a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bot that provided emotional feedback and were additionally able to control different <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bot dimensions (e.g., timing, appearance, and behavior). Our findings show, first, that higher control levels increase <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and trust in emotion-aware <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots. Second, higher control levels do not significantly increase cognitive effort. Third, in our post hoc behavioral analysis, we identify four behavioral control strategies based on control feature usage timing, quantity, and cognitive effort. These findings shed light on the individual preferences of user control over emotion-aware <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots. Overall, our study contributes to the literature by showing the positive effect of control over emotion-aware <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots and by identifying four behavioral control strategies. With our findings, we also provide practical implications for future design of emotion-aware <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots. • In this study, we investigated the effect of control over emotion-aware <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots. • Rising ability to control emotion-aware <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots increases user <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and trust. • At the same time, a higher level of control does not increase cognitive effort. • Analyzing users’ control behavior, we identified four distinct control strategies. • Users can be categorized as Soloists, Kickstarter, Controller, and Undecideds.</p>

<p>Abstract Almost every aspect of a person’s daily life is affected by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICTs), and some unfavorable outcomes such as technostress have been noticed. In this study, we examine how technostress affects knowledge hiding. Drawing from the energy-consuming characteristic of technostress and prior research on how technostress affects ICT users, this article builds and tests a model that takes work exhaustion as a mediator and explores the moderating role of job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. To test our conceptual model, we examined the responses to a survey questionnaire submitted by 287 ICT users from multiple organizations. Using structural equation modeling, we found that technostress increases employees’ knowledge hiding behavior, and work exhaustion partially mediates technostress and knowledge hiding, while job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> only moderates the relationship between technostress and work exhaustion when the fourth factor of technostress, viz., techno-insecurity, is excluded. We also discuss future research directions and implications of the results.</p>

<p>An understanding of the overall relationship between the work-related use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) and employees’ well-being is lacking as the rising number of studies has produced mixed results. We meta-analytically synthesize and integrate existing literature on the consequences of ICT use based on the job demands-resources model. By using meta-analytical structural equation modeling based on 63 independent studies ( N = 26,295), we shed light on the relationship between ICT use and employees’ well-being (operationalized as burnout and engagement) in a model that incorporates the mediating role of ICT-related resources and demands. Results show that ICT use is opposingly related to burnout and engagement through <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, availability, and work-life conflict. Our study brings clarity into the contradictory results and highlights the importance of a simultaneous consideration of both positive and negative effects for a comprehensive understanding of the relationship. We further show that the time of use and managerial position, and methodological moderators can clarify heterogeneity in previous results.</p>

<p>Purpose Previous studies overemphasize the negative effects of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> usage (SMU) within organizations and underestimate its positive influences on employees’ behavior. This study attempts to link employees’ <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use at work to their creativity performance. Design/methodology/approach Based on the bounded generalized reciprocity theory and unbounded indirect reciprocity (UIR) theory, the authors developed a research model. To test the model, the authors collected a set of 172 paired data of organizations and employees from 31 knowledge-intensive enterprises in China to test the hypothesis. Findings This research found that the social, cognitive and hedonic uses of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> all directly affect employee creativity. Relational energy fully mediates the effects of the cognitive and hedonic usages on creativity. Moreover, job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> moderates the effects of the relationships among the social, cognitive and hedonic uses on employee creativity. Originality/value The conclusions not only enriched authors’ understanding of the effectiveness of interpersonal interaction but also extended the research boundary of the relationship between SMU and employee creativity.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) is key to educational development. This study explores the mechanism influencing the use of ICT on students’ science literacy. We utilized two-level hierarchical linear models and structural equation models to analyze data collected from the 2015 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) in China. Results indicate that student-level and school-level ICT factors, in particular ICT interest, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in using ICT, and ICT availability at school positively impact the development of students’ science literacy. Further, we found some notable interactions between school-level factors and student-level ICT variables. Moreover, there are structural relationships among ICT availability, ICT emotional perception, ICT learning usage behaviors, science self-efficacy, and science literacy. We also found that teacher-delivered science instruction has a negative moderating effect on ICT learning usage and science self-efficacy. These findings have important implications of how to integrate ICT in future science teaching practices.</p>

<p>With government and industry experiencing a critical shortage of trained <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security professionals, organisations are spearheading various training programs to cultivate <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security skills. With more people working from home and the existing <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security staff shortages, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>criminals are increasingly exploiting new and existing vulnerabilities by launching ubiquitous <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>attacks. This study focuses on how to close the gap in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security skills through interest cultivation and self-determined motivation. Our study shows that situational interest (SI) in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security along with situational motivational determinants (i.e., perceived learning <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and perceived relatedness) engendered self-determined motivation toward <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security training. Consequently, self-determined motivation facilitated actual learning behaviour. Meanwhile, individual interest in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security created positive moderating effects in the relationships between self-determination and its key antecedents (i.e., perceived relatedness and situational interest). Based on these findings, we provide research implications accordingly.</p>

The present study aims to further explore the direct effects of parent-adolescent and peer relationships on adolescent MPA as well as the indirect effects through the mediating roles of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness needs satisfaction.Our sample consisted of 1766 Chinese adolescents (53.10% male; Mage = 13.33, SD = 1.94, range from 10 to 18 years) who completed questionnaires regarding parent-adolescent relationships, peer relationships, psychological needs satisfaction, and MPA. SPSS 24.0 was used to analyze correlations among variables and Mplus 7.4 was used to test the structural equation model in this study.(1) positive parent-adolescent relationships were negatively associated with adolescent MPA, while peer relationships did not show a significant association with MPA; (2) <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and competence needs satisfaction significantly mediated the effects of parent-adolescent and peer relationships on MPA, while the mediating role of relatedness need satisfaction between parent-adolescent and peer relationships and MPA was not significant; (3) the mediating effect of competence need satisfaction between peer relationships and MPA was significantly stronger than that between parent-adolescent relationships and MPA.This study explored the different mechanisms by which parent-adolescent and peer relationships influence adolescent MPA. These discoveries may contribute to intervention and prevention programs for adolescent MPA.</p>

<p>In light of the accelerated growth of an aging population , coupled with the massive diffusion of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies (ICTs), research on whether ICTs meet the needs of elderly users is important and timely. Despite the popularity of self-determination theory, few studies have adopted this theoretical framework to explain need satisfaction among this group. The continuous use of mobile government (m-government) relies on the satisfaction of citizens’ needs. Through the theoretical lens of self-determination theory, we developed a research model of m-government for elders’ intrinsic need satisfaction. In this model, the design factors, performance factors, and individuals’ ability factors are incorporated. Based on data from 366 m-government-for-elders users in China’s Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces, and through the use of structural equation modeling, the results show that complexity has a negative correlation with <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> need satisfaction and competence need satisfaction. Visual appeal positively affects all dimensions of intrinsic need satisfaction. Information quality has a positive relationship with relatedness need satisfaction. The effects of personalization on relatedness need satisfaction and the influence of personalization on competence need satisfaction were significant. Information literacy moderates the relationship between complexity and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> need satisfaction, as well as between complexity and competence need satisfaction. The findings of this article enrich existing m-government research and provide practical implications for policymakers and m-government developers in China. • The three basic intrinsic needs of seniors users are met by using m-government for elders. • Visual appeal of devices is the most salient driving factor of intrinsic need satisfaction. • We examine the moderating effect of information literacy. • The antecedents of three kinds of intrinsic need satisfaction are different.</p>

<p>Evolving <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) reshapes people’s reading activities by popularizing digital reading. Past studies focused on the relationships between students’ frequency of ICT use and reading performance but neglected the possible interrelationships between students’ ICT-related psychological factors, school contextual factors, and reading performance. This study applied the Self-determination Theory (SDT) to explore the relationships between students’ ICT-related psychological factors (perceived interest, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and social interaction in using ICT) and reading performance. The possible moderation effects of schools’ contextual variables (schools’ support in ICT devices and schools’ support in teachers’ capacity to integrate technology in teaching) were also investigated. Data from 222,293 secondary students from 10,103 schools in 47 economies who participated in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018 were analyzed using three-level hierarchical linear modeling. The results provided support for the SDT by confirming the positive correlations between students’ ICT-related interest, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and competence and reading performance, and the accentuating moderation effect of schools’ contextual factors. However, students’ perceived social interaction in ICT use was negatively correlated with reading performance, and this negative correlation worsened with increasing schools’ support in ICT devices while buffered with increasing schools’ support in teachers’ capacity to use technology.</p>

<p>Bullying and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying prevention remain a major priority for schools, communities, and families, and research is clear that positive, constructive parenting practices can play a key preventive role. The current work explores six dimensions of parenting (warmth, structure, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support, rejection, chaos, and coercion), and their specific relationship to school and online bullying. Using survey data from a nationally representative sample of 1474 English-speaking 12- to 17-year-old US youth, we found that students whose parent(s) exhibit warmth, structure, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support are less likely to have engaged in bullying or <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying offending, while those with parental relations marked by rejection, chaos, and coercion are more likely to have participated in both forms of peer aggression.

<p>Because of COVID-19, higher education changed as institutions went remote and students’ mental health was challenged. Rural universities were disproportionately affected because of limited <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> access. The purpose of this study was to investigate the psychological need satisfaction/frustration and mental health among rural college students during this pandemic.Six hundred ninety-eight students (Mage = 22.15 ± 2.55) at a rural South-eastern university were recruited.Participants completed a survey examining stress, anxiety, need satisfaction/frustration and previous experience with online courses.Anxiety, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and competence frustration were found to predict 60% of the variance of stress. Another regression analysis found stress, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness frustration to predict 70% of the anxiety variance.Students are frustrated due to the lack of control and restrictions affecting their social interaction. Understanding the relationship between need satisfaction/frustration and mental health can aid university administration in developing interventions that address rural students’ needs.</p>

<p>The present research examined relationships between parental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support, parental psychological control, and Chinese emerging adults’ autonomous regulation in their university studies as well as dysregulation in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> engagement. A total of 287 (102 female and 185 male) Chinese university students reported on their perceived parenting styles, psychological needs, and behavior regulation. Results showed that basic psychological need satisfaction was positively associated with parental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support and autonomous regulation of learning; need frustration was positively correlated with parental psychological control and dysregulation in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> engagement. More importantly, psychological need frustration was a mediator of the relation between parental psychological control and dysregulation in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> engagement. Our findings suggest that students living in an <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive familial environment tend to have satisfied psychological needs as well as autonomous learning behavior. Impairment of psychological needs could be one of the mechanisms through which psychologically controlling parenting was linked to dysregulation of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use in Chinese culture.</p>

<p>Applying an integrated theoretical model consisting of the socioecological theory, the self-determination theory, and the broaden-and-build theory, the present study tested a moderated mediation model of parental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support, filial piety, and gratitude to study how these factors are jointly related to pathological <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use (PIU) in Chinese undergraduate students. A total of 1054 Chinese undergraduate students (M age = 20.35, SD = 1.00, 34.7% females) aged between 16 and 24 years participated in this study. They were instructed to complete self-reported questionnaires on parental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support, filial piety, gratitude, and PIU. The results showed that parental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support was negatively associated with PIU, and filial piety partially mediated this relation. Specifically, parental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support was positively related to filial piety, which, in turn, was negatively associated with PIU. In addition, gratitude moderated the first path of the indirect relation and the direct relation of this mediation effect. To be specific, undergraduate students with higher gratitude showed high filial piety and low PIU, in the context of low parental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support, than those with lower gratitude. Taken together, the current study contributes to extant research by highlighting the vital role of parental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support in mitigating undergraduate students’ PIU and illustrating how filial piety explains the underlying mechanism of this association. This study also provides novel insights into intervention or prevention programs by demonstrating that gratitude alleviates the adverse effect of low parental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support on students’ PIU.</p>

<p>The aim of this preregistered study was to identify dispositional predictors of podcast listening and examine the associations between aspects of podcast listening, dispositional predictors, and psychological outcomes. Three hundred and six adults from a range of countries completed an online questionnaire that assessed individual difference predictors (the Big Five personality factors, curiosity, need for cognition, need to belong, age, and gender), aspects of podcast listening (amount, format, setting, device, and social aspects), and potential outcomes (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, relatedness, meaning, mindfulness, and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> addiction). As predicted, openness to experience, interest-based curiosity, and need for cognition positively predicted podcast listening. Contrary to predictions, need to belong negatively predicted podcast listening, and time spent listening to podcasts was not associated with <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, relatedness, meaning, mindfulness, or <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> addiction. However, certain aspects of podcast listening (e.g., parasocial relationships and social engagement) were related to positive outcomes and to our predictor variables. Furthermore, neuroticism negatively predicted podcast listening. Overall, the findings support the idea that informational motives can play a role in podcast listening, and that some aspects of listening are associated with positive outcomes.</p>

<p>Almost every aspect of a person’s daily life is impacted by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICTs), and some unfavorable outcomes like technostress have been noticed. In this study, we examine how technostress affects knowledge hiding. Drawing from the energy-consuming characteristic of technostress and prior research on how technostress affects ICT users, this article builds and tests a model that takes work exhaustion as a mediator and explored the moderating role of job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. To test our conceptual model, we examined the responses to a survey questionnaire submitted by 287 ICT users from multiple organizations. Using structural equation modeling, we found that technostress increases employees’ knowledge hiding behavior, and work exhaustion partially mediates technostress and knowledge hiding, while job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> only moderates the relationship between technostress and work exhaustion when the fourth factor of technological stress, techno-insecurity, is excluded. We also discuss future research directions and implications of the results.</p>

<p>The present study identifies and discusses the impact of personality factors on remote workers in China, using a phenomenological methodology to understand participants’ lived experiences. The sample population is comprised of Chinese citizens born in China. Data were collected through one-on-one, online semi-structured interviews using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">WeChat</span>. The interview questions are structured to allow participants to explain personality traits found in productive and unproductive remote workers. In addition, the questions explore traits positively associated with developing trust and how the psychological needs of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competency, and relatedness impact remote workers. After data collection, the data were analyzed and coded to develop themes used to answer the core research questions. This study’s findings offer benefits to companies using remote workers and employees new to remote work or those aiming to become remote workers since the data collected provides a holistic picture of remote work from actual workers’ perspective. The information gathered from the research participants allowed the researcher to determine that one of the most beneficial aspects of remote work is <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and the ability to set one’s schedule. Confidence directly impacts feelings of competency among remote workers, and relatedness is negatively impacted by being a remote worker because of decreased opportunities for face-to-face interactions.</p>

<p>Purpose This research considers the role of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms and their impact on individuals’ eudaimonic well-being, and aims to help develop a social marketing programme in the future that would enable students in Jordanian universities to flourish, by focussing on their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> drivers and overcoming their challenges in an attempt to improve their psychological well-being (PWB). Design/methodology/approach The authors used qualitative research examining lived experiences and behaviours around <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use. The authors conducted 39 semi-structured interviews with students at various universities across Jordan, alongside an online survey with open-ended questions, which were based on six PWB dimensions: environmental mastery, personal growth, purpose in life, self-acceptance, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and positive relationships with others. Findings <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social media</span> use and advertising were found to positively impact students’ self-acceptance and relationships with others but to negatively impact their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. They were found to have different impacts on students’ sense of purpose in life and personal growth, depending on the content shared on their platforms. Originality/value The ethical debate surrounding <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> amongst students indicates that such social marketing programmes might stimulate individuals’ sense of control over their environment, encourage openness to new experiences, and give their lives a beneficial direction. The study makes recommendations for the creation of an evidence-based social marketing programme that is extrinsically focussed on increasing resilience, creating an audience persona and building awareness of PWB.</p>

<p>Quality of life (QOL) is lower for transition-age autistic youth compared to typically developing counterparts. Leisure-time pursuits have been linked to higher quality of life in the general population and among autistic adults. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore leisure-time use among transition-age autistic youth. Youth ages 18–23 years were recruited through universities and organizations that serve the autistic population and their families across the United States. Participants took photos of their leisure-time activities over a 7-day period using their own <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s. They were then interviewed via Zoom using a semi-structured interview guide that was based on the Self-Determination Theory framework and the Iwasaki leisure-time model. Data were analyzed using directed qualitative content analysis based on the theoretical framework. Eighteen young autistic adults participated in the study (nine male, five female, three agender/non-binary, and one transgender). Solitary, screen-based activities were most common. Major themes were that activities contributed positively to a sense of achievement and a sense of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and there were few major barriers to favored activities. While most activities were done alone, rather than describing these activities as isolating, activities helped participants cope with stress. Participants gained a sense of connection when they were engaged in leisure activities with others who shared common interests. Results suggest that appropriate interventions may support youth in choosing activities they most enjoy, even if they appear to be solitary or sedentary, and to help ensure that youth are gaining maximal benefits from these activities. • Few studies have examined leisure-time use among transition-age autistic youth. • Youth effectively shared experiences using participant-driven photo-elicitation. • Results suggest leisure activities contribute to well-being.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic led to an abrupt change from in-person to online teaching in higher education, resulting in increased use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) and students’ stress and uncertainty. Integrating theories of human motivation, stress, and humane work design, we investigated whether different types of action regulation hindrances (ARH) pertaining to human (ICT competence deficits), technology (technical problems), interaction (coordination difficulties), and task aspects (work overload) related to technostress (H1). Furthermore, we examined if this relationship was mediated by satisfaction of the basic human needs for competence, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and relatedness (H2). Our analysis of causes and mechanisms of technostress is based on cross-sectional survey data (self-report) from 205 psychology students attending an organizational psychology class that was switched from an in-person to an online format due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Structural equation modeling revealed that different types of ARH (i.e., ICT competence deficits, technical problems, coordination difficulties, work overload) positively predicted technostress (β = .17 to β = .42, p &lt; .05). The effects were (partially) mediated by satisfaction of the need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (β = .11 to β = .15, p &lt; .05), for all ARH except technical problems (β = .01, p = .86). We discuss implications for online course planning, technostress prevention as well as potential interventions beyond pandemic times.</p>

<p>Memories of rejection contribute to feeling lonely. However, high-quality listening that conveys well-meaning attention and understanding when speakers discuss social rejection may help them to reconnect. Speakers may experience less loneliness because they feel close and connected (relatedness) to the listener and because listening supports self-congruent expression (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>). Five experiments (total N = 1,643) manipulated listening during visualized (Studies 1, 4, 5) and actual (Studies 2, 3) conversations. We used different methods (video vignettes; in-person; <span style="background-color:lightgreen">computer-mediated</span>; recall; written scenarios) to compare high-quality with regular (all studies) and poor (Study 1) listening. Findings across studies showed that high-quality listening reduced speakers’ state loneliness after they shared past experiences of social rejection. Parallel mediation analyses indicated that both feeling related to the listener and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> satisfaction (particularly its self-congruence component; Study 5) mediated the effect of listening on loneliness. These results provide novel insights into the hitherto unexplored effect of listening on state loneliness.</p>

<p>Studies on self-determination theory (SDT) have placed satisfaction of basic psychological needs (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, relatedness, and competence) at the core of well-being, whereas frustration of these needs results in multiple potentially unhealthy mental and behavioral patterns. This study analyzed how need satisfaction and frustration relate to the severity of gambling and gaming problems.A survey study with 18-75-year-old Finnish participants (N = 1530; 50.33% male) was conducted in April 2021. Basic psychological needs were measured with the Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction and Frustration Scale, mental health issues with the five-item Mental Health Inventory, gambling problems with the Problem Gambling Severity Index, and gaming problems with the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> Gaming Disorder Test. Zero-inflated negative binomial analyses were conducted to examine how satisfaction and frustration of basic psychological needs, together with mental health issues, are associated with gaming and gambling problems.Mental health issues were associated with gambling and gaming problems, but this association became nonsignificant when basic psychological needs were added to the model. However, better mental health still was associated with the absence of gaming problems. While need satisfaction had no association with the absence of gaming or gambling problems, need frustration was associated with increases in the severity of both gaming and gambling problems.Frustration of basic psychological needs for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, relatedness, and competence is associated with both gambling and gaming problems and should be considered when developing treatment and support for those who experience such problems.</p>

<p>Online higher education teaching and learning has become a new normal in many countries due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, the support for online learning seems inadequate to address students’ diverse online learning needs and may impede the inclusiveness in higher education. Therefore, based on a questionnaire administered to higher education students in Sri Lanka, this paper examines the support or lack of support students have experienced during the university closure that may enable or hinder inclusive online learning. It draws on Self-Determination Theory (SDT) as a theoretical lens to analyse and make sense of these enablers for and barriers to inclusive online higher education. The key findings suggest that students first need <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support to access stable and affordable <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and devices, and quality online learning resources. They also need competence support for monitoring and managing their own learning through feedback and scaffolding as they engage in their learning online. Finally, they need relatedness support for reducing their anxiety and having a sense of connectedness by interacting and communicating with teachers and students.</p>

<p>Abstract How <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> impacts the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of its users is a topic of increasing focus. However, much of the literature that explores these impacts fails to engage in depth with the philosophical literature on <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. This has resulted in a failure to consider the full range of impacts that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> might have on <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. A deeper consideration of these impacts is thus needed, given the importance of both <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> as a moral concept and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> as a feature of contemporary life. By drawing on this philosophical literature, we argue that <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is broadly a matter of developing <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> competencies, having authentic ends and control over key aspects of your own life, and not being manipulated, coerced, and controlled by others. We show how the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of users of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> can be disrespected and harmed through the control that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> can have over its users’ data , attention , and behaviour .

<p>This study examines fitness app use patterns and their correlates among Chinese users from the perspectives of uses and gratification theory and self-determination theory. Our sample comprised 632 users of WeRun, the fitness plugin of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">WeChat</span>, the largest Chinese mobile social networking app; participants completed an online survey and provided self-tracked physical activity data, which were subjected to latent class analysis. Based on the four-class latent class model (which yielded the best model fit and the most interpretable results), 30.5%, 27.5%, 24.7%, and 17.3% of the users were categorized as light users, reward-oriented users, lifestyle-oriented users, and interaction-oriented users, respectively. Moreover, class membership was associated with gender, age, education, income, life satisfaction, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and platform-based motivations. There is a significant heterogeneity in fitness app use and exercise behaviors. Platform-based motivations and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> are important classification factors, as users are looking for specific kinds of gratification from their use of fitness apps. Demographics and individual characteristics are also explanatory factors for class membership. The study findings suggest that fitness app designers should segment users based on motivation and gratification.</p>

<p>Research has extensively studied the negative effects of digital communication on adolescents’ well-being. However, positive digital experiences and behavior in adolescence are still poorly understood. The recently developed Digital Flourishing Scale addresses this gap and focuses on the positive perceptions of a user’s experiences and behaviors in digital communication among adults. In this paper, we developed an adolescent version of this scale. Study 1 demonstrated the internal consistency of the scale and the same factor structure for adolescence as for adulthood: connectedness, civil participation, positive social comparison, authentic self-presentation, and self-control. Study 2 confirmed the identified factor structure with a second sample of adolescents and established measurement invariance across genders. The construct validity of the scale was confirmed by investigating associations with related constructs, including the basic psychological needs from self-determination theory (competence, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and relatedness), secure attachment to a close friend, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> aggression, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>-induced inspiration, authenticity of posted positive content, and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> self-control failure. The results indicated that not all adolescents flourish equally online. Differences occurred depending on the adolescents’ gender and socioeconomic status. The paper concludes that the newly developed scale is a valid and reliable measure for assessing adolescents’ perceptions of digital thriving and digital empowerment.</p>

<p>*Corresponding Author: Nele Jacobs; <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>: nele.jacobs @ uhasselt.be Abstract Health promotion is an important challenge for the health sector in the 21st century. Chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) can be avoided by, amongst other things, making prudent lifestyle changes. However, stimulating long-term behaviour change remains an important challenge for health promotion practitioners. SelfDetermination Theory (SDT) has been applied in various health care settings to facilitate long-term behaviour change with some evidence of positive outcomes. From the perspective of SDT the effectiveness of prevention programmes should not only be defined as the proportion of participants that comply with recommendations, but should also give information on the level of autonomous motivation of the compliers. SDT would suggest that to stimulate the development of autonomous motivation and long-term behaviour change, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supporting interventions should be developed. Health care professionals can enhance patient behaviour change outcomes through support of patients’ psychological needs for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness. However, the health promotion field, involving health practitioners with various professional backgrounds, requires a more practical and specific summary of recommendations to improve the quality of intervention design. The aim of this manuscript is to describe in detail how practical recommendations from SDT were applied to a cardiovascular prevention programme in Belgium.</p>
