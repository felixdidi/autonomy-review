<p>Technologic evolutions of the last two decades, such as the development of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>, had a strong disruptive effect to the society and the economy. However, because of the flexible concepts of the civil law codifications a disruptive effect in the private law until now did not exist. Especially the legal consequences of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> were integrated into the private law without bigger categorial or structural changes. This applies equally to most of the cases of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in recent times. With more advanced development of AI-systems, though, it may not be possible anymore to apply the traditional terms of the private law to the use of AI without leaving the constitutional law background of the private law. This article discusses the impact of the use of a future advanced independent AI on the concept of the private <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the contract law. Furthermore, it gives an overview on the new legislative approach of a human centric use of AI in the European Union.</p>

<p>Abstract This paper delves into the nuances of ‘fashion’ in recommender systems and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> analytics, which shape and define an individual’s perception and self-relationality. Its aim is twofold: first, it supports a different perspective on privacy that focuses on the individual’s process of identity construction considering the social and personal aspects of ‘fashion’. Second, it underlines the limitations of computational models in capturing the diverse meaning of ‘fashion’, whereby the algorithmic prediction of user preferences is based on individual conscious and unconscious associations with fashion identity. I test both of these claims in the context of current concerns over the impact of algorithmic personalisation systems on individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and privacy: creating ‘filter bubbles’, nudging the user beyond their conscious awareness, as well as the inherent bias in algorithmic decision-making. We need an understanding of privacy that sustains the inherent reduction of fashion identity to literal attributes and protects individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in shaping algorithmic approximations of the self.</p>

<p>The article deals with the current legal and organizational principles of the European Union`s <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security, the problems and prospects for the development of the relevant EU mechanism in the context of modern <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> threats. The evolution and qualitative dynamics of the EU <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> policy from the adoption of the first legal acts in the early 2000s to the publication of the second EU Security Strategy draft in December 2020 are analyzed. The study found that the European Union has the potential to achieve strategic <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>politics. However, it needs a more coherent policy of coordination, further increase of funding and building of institutional capacity of the EU, equalization of member states possibilities. The conclusions state that Europe is interested in the comprehensive development of EU <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security policy. The cross-border nature of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> threats means that the EU’s resilience in this matter directly affects its security. The current direction of the EU’s capacity building and especially close cooperation with NATO provide a chance to avoid difficult political dilemmas. Official data from the European Union’s <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span> Security Agency show that the number of violations of privacy is growing among the types of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> attacks. This puts on the agenda the activities of EU structures and Member States the need to develop a system of human rights protection in the field of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security. One of its basic elements should be updated legislation, in particular, the new EU <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span> Security Strategy. The European Union does not stop there and constantly strives to develop opportunities to counter and prevent <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> threats in order to achieve strategic <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the organization. The EU needs to overcome its excessive bureaucratization and imbalance in the funding of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> policy management programs and the practical development of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> attack protection, prevention and repulsion systems. The EU’s place in the future global <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security system will depend on the real strengthening of this second segment of programs.</p>

<p>Today, the digital transformation of the world economy has become an objective reality. The steady growth in the availability and, as a result, the prevalence of high-speed <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, the increasing level of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of production and logistics, and the development of digital infrastructure lead to a complex transformation of both markets and industries in general and consumer groups, manufacturers, and retailers in particular. The result of these processes is a radical transformation of the complex of demanded knowledge, skills, and abilities. However, the labor market is formed under the influence of both economic and social processes, which significantly increases its complexity as an object of analysis. The multidimensional impact of digital transformation on the labor market is ambiguous, and the potential synergistic effect of the impact of particular manifestations of digital transformation processes can be both positive and negative. The consequences of such a transformation can be revolutionary. Thus, the problem of effective assessment of the consequences of labor market transformation under the influence of digitalization is extremely relevant. The purpose of this work is to formalize the mathematical vectors of influence of digitalization factors on the development of the labor market. To achieve this goal, digitalization is presented in the form of quantified factors expressed using specific indicators, and the unemployment rate is used as an indicator of the labor market. The main research tool is the regression analysis. As a result, a regression model is obtained that expresses the dualistic nature of the impact of digitalization on the development of the labor market</p>

<p>The article reveals the evaluation of the activities carried out by scientific and pedagogical staff in domestic higher education institutions from a process point of view and the standpoint of the result. The main types of assessment used in higher education institutions are described. The results obtained during the analysis of scientific publications, normative documents and questionnaires of teachers and managers confirmed the massive rating of the activities of scientific and pedagogical workers, its superiority among other types of assessment.
 According to the materials available in the open <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> access, a comparative analysis of the rating policy of 20 higher education institutions, located in different regions of Ukraine, was carried out. It was found that in each university the determinant of the rating policy is Development Strategy, according to which the evaluation of research and teaching staff is positioned as an important procedure for internal quality assurance of higher education and a factor in stimulating professional development of teachers.
 Based on a comparative analysis of the regulatory framework, criteria, indicators and evaluation procedures inherent in different institutions of higher education, common features and characteristics of rating evaluation of research and teaching staff. The personal and institutional dimensions of the significance of various evaluation of the activity of scientific and pedagogical workers are revealed. Emphasis is placed on modern indicators and problematic evaluation issues identified in the process of studying domestic practices. Insufficient use of information collected through rating assessment for prognostic purposes is emphasized.
 The tendency of updating criteria and indicators of a rating estimation of activities carried out by scientific and pedagogical workers of universities is established. An objective relationship between the establishment of coefficients for the rating of the main types of professional activities of research and teaching staff (educational, scientific, methodological, organizational and educational) and the priority of the holding activities for the university at the time of the rating.</p>

<p>The role of the traditional labour market has been changed by globalisation and modern technology, particularly by the unprecedented and generalised use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s. The platform economy, also called “gig economy” is radically changing the rights and duties of service providers, as it is associated with a high degree of flexibility and profit maximisation, which suppresses or significantly limits traditional workers’ rights, such as the right to paid holiday, maternity license or unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>This paper focuses on Uber, the current international market leader on online ridesourcing platforms, and the impact they have on gig workers that chose to enter the platform. Online ridesourcing platforms assign private drivers to rides booked and paid for by passengers through an app. The platform’s drivers may vary from ‘genuine’ freelance business owners, ‘multiple jobholders’, “moonlight” workers to workers who opted for working full-time as gig workers.</p>
<p>Among the latter are former professional riders or amateur riders who were unable to cope with the tight restrictions of a heavily regulated professional passenger transportation sector, high-priced licenses, inefficient work-life balance policies and lack of safety guarantees. A sector of the scholarship argues that the conditions offered by platforms to drivers encourage entrepreneurship across all segments of society and foster the decentralization of economic growth. In fact, on-demand ridesharing platforms adapt the drivers’ income to the market, providing for primetime pricing to meet increased demand. Additionally, by allowing for a flexible work schedule, they are deemed to promote work-life balance. Finally, by integrating technology they ensure a more efficient provision of services and a safer one as well, with passenger registration, money-free rides and GPS location as integral part of the operation. The wider majority of the scholarship, however, has been heavily criticizing these platform services for infringing workers’ rights.</p>
<p>If there is an almost consensus in the scholarship that gig workers have been opting for entering a labour economy which will affect them, their families and other parts of the working population in the mid or long-run, the question is asked whether it is justified for regulators to nudge such workers into taking decisions (or imposing these upon them) which are better for their own welfare and the decent living standard of other workers. In other words, what should be the balance between respecting the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of ‘gig-workers’ in grasping their chances to access the ‘gig-labour market’ and taking paternalizing measures to protect ‘gig-workers’ against ‘self-exploitation’?</p>

<p><span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span>crime has been a contentious issue among security actors, vis-à-vis the extent to which international cooperation may be fostered to respond to the accelerating incidence of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-attacks. This paper contrasts between the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-governance approaches adopted by two non-Western regional organizations, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Gulf Cooperation Council, over the past decade. Considering their similar institutional origins, Most Similar Systems Design methodology was employed to assess how ASEAN and GCC have distinctly responded to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>crime. It considers the dynamics of the digital divide — a divide which is exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic — and in which ASEAN and the GCC are challenged to bolster their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-capabilities. Findings reveal that GCC increasingly diffuses norms of international cooperation to tackle <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>crime. By contrast, ASEAN embodies <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> norms which regulate behavior along the lines of intra-regional cooperation, wherein norms of international cooperation are rendered subsidiary to norms of regional <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.</p>

<p>Building off our prior work on the practical evaluation of autonomous robotic systems, this chapter discusses how an existing framework can be extended to apply to autonomous <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> systems. It is hoped that such a framework can inform pragmatic discussions of ethical and regulatory norms in a proactive way. Issues raised by autonomous systems in the physical and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> realms are distinct; however, discussions about the norms and laws governing these two related manifestations of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> can and should inform one another. Therefore, this paper emphasizes the factors that distinguish autonomous systems in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>space, labeled disembodied autonomous systems, from systems that physically exist in the form of embodied autonomous systems. By highlighting the distinguishing factors of these two forms of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, this paper informs the extension of our assessment tool to software systems, bringing us into the legal and ethical discussions of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>space.</p>

<p>The ethical issues raised by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security practices and technologies are of critical importance. However, there is disagreement about what is the best ethical framework for understanding those issues. In this paper we seek to address this shortcoming through the introduction of a principlist ethical framework for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security that builds on existing work in adjacent fields of applied ethics, bioethics, and AI ethics. By redeploying the AI4People framework, we develop a domain-relevant specification of five ethical principles in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security: beneficence, non-maleficence, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, justice, and explicability. We then illustrate the advantages of this principlist framework by examining the ethical issues raised by four common <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security contexts: penetration testing, distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS), ransomware, and system administration. These case analyses demonstrate the utility of this principlist framework as a basis for understanding <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security ethics and for cultivating the ethical expertise and ethical sensitivity of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security professionals and other stakeholders.</p>

<p>This paper attempts to analyse how important the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netic governance is to higher education institutions in Malaysia. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span>netic governance is a structure, process of a system to empower greater decision making, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, leadership, and greater accountability. Thus, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netic approach is heavily depending on information, utilise information for decision making, policy making and feedback to respond effectively. The concept also relevant with co-production strategy, whereby public services offered at the institution would focus on making use of resources through community building, collaboration, and resource sharing. In this context, “governance” refers to the role of multi-stakeholders involved in decision making, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, leadership, and accountability. The effectiveness and success of this <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netic governance depends on the institution community; the board, Vice-Chancellor, university management committee, Deans and Directors involved. The main idea is to analyse <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netic governance as a model for processing information and a platform for co-production on governance empowerment at higher education institutions in Malaysia. Hence literatures are reviewed to apply the concepts to this research. An expected outcome of this research would be the evidence to improve policy performance in governance arrangements. Therefore, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netic governance contribution is the practice of good governance for intelligent institutions.</p>

<p>The formation and development of the knowledge economy logically lead to the need for an indepth study of the nature and properties of information in economic systems. The priority value of the information resource and knowledge in the activities of industrial enterprises is determined both by the prospects for the development of science-intensive products and their competitiveness in the world and domestic markets, and by the desire to ensure the stable operation of the enterprise in a highly disturbed business environment. With the search and analysis of the dependences of the production, financial and economic processes taking place in them on the control information, the systemic interaction of the enterprise resources and the dynamics of key indicators of the activity of industrial enterprises are revealed.From the standpoint of thermodynamics, statistical physics and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netics, it is proposed to spread the information concept of V. Trapeznikov to substantiate and modelling the dependence of a number of economic and financial indicators on the amount of accumulated information in the controlled complex of an industrial enterprise.Modeling and interpretation of the relationship between the volume of control information with the uncertainty of the functioning of an industrial enterprise and the achieved level of knowledge about it is carried out. The condition for the stability of the indicator of the effect of activity and the financial stability of the enterprise (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> ratio) is formulated. The mathematical condition for the range of changes in the level of knowledge of industrial enterprises has been substantiated.</p>

<p>Background: Anxiety is common among youths in primary care. Face-to-face treatment has been the first choice for clinicians, but during the COVID-19 pandemic, digital psychological interventions have substantially increased. Few studies have examined young people’s interest in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> treatment or the attitudes they and their parents have toward it. Objective: This study aims to investigate adolescents’ and parents’ attitudes toward and experiences of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>-based cognitive behavioral anxiety treatment in primary care and its presumptive effects. Methods: The study used mixed methods, analyzing qualitative data thematically and quantitative data with nonparametric analysis. Participants were 14 adolescents and 14 parents recruited in adolescent primary health care clinics. The adolescents and their parents filled out mental health questionnaires before and after treatment, and were interviewed during ongoing treatment. Results: The quantitative data indicated that the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy program used in this study was successful in reducing symptoms (χ22=8.333; P=.02) and that adolescents’ motivation is essential to the treatment outcome (r=0.58; P=.03). The qualitative results show that youths highly value their independence and freedom to organize treatment work on their own terms. The parents expressed uncertainty about their role and how to support their child in treatment. It was important for parents to respect the youths’ need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> while also engaging with them in the treatment work. Conclusions: <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> treatment in primary care is accepted by both youths and their parents, who need clarification about the difference between their role and the therapist’s role. Patient motivation should be considered before treatment, and therapists need to continue to develop the virtual alliance. Finally, primary care should be clearer in informing adolescents and their parents about the possibility of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> treatment.</p>

<p>The learning processes of the academic year 2019/2020 were characterized by a great change: the general suspension of teaching in presence and the synchronous and asynchronous start of lessons due to the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus (Covid-19). This change required teachers of all types and institutional grades to re-design educational activities using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies. The International Conference on «Didactics and university didactics: Theories, cultures, practices» at the test of the Covid- 19 Lockdown, had as its objective the comparison between experts who have returned, on the basis of empirical evidences, a picture of the impact that the use of ICT has determined on the learning and socialization of pupils and on the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the various scholastic and university institutions.</p>

<p>Anticipating the ethical impact of emerging technologies is an essential part of responsible innovation. One such emergent technology is the digital twin which we define here as a living replica of a physical system (human or non-human). A digital twin combines various emerging technologies such as AI, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things, big data and robotics, each component bringing its own socio-ethical issues to the resulting artefacts. The question thus arises which of these socio-ethical themes surface in the process and how they are perceived by stakeholders in the field. In this report we present the results of a qualitative study into the socio-ethical benefits and socio-ethical risks of using digital twins in healthcare. Employing insights from ethics of technology and the Quadruple Helix theory of innovation, we conducted desk research of white literature and 23 interviews with representatives from the four helixes: industry, research, policy and civil society. The ethical scan revealed several important areas where the digital twin can produce socio-ethical value (e.g., prevention and treatment of disease, cost reduction, patient <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and freedom, equal treatment) but also several important areas of socio-ethical risks (e.g., privacy and property of data, disruption of existing societal structures, inequality and injustice). We conclude with a reflection on the employed analytical tool and suggestions for further research.</p>

Background
</h3>
Practicing family style meal service in early care and education (ECE) settings supports children’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and improves self-regulation of energy intake. However, during COVID-19, CDC passed a directive to ECE to pause family style meal service. Therefore, we conducted an ECE webinar focused on how to feed children responsively during plated meal service to help providers support children’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and self-regulation.
<h3 class="anchored">
Objective
</h3>
To evaluate changes in the level of understanding, behavioral intention to implement knowledge, and confidence about how to feed children (2-5 years) responsively during plated meal service. Also, to determine need for future training opportunities.
<h3 class="anchored">
Study Design, Setting, Participants
</h3>
Retrospective pretest-posttest study. The webinar was advertised through an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> newsletter disseminated by a national-level platform, Penn State Extension Better Kid Care. Participants attended the online webinar for 1 hour on August 11, 2020, had access to an Extension publication (http://bit.ly/3pnJ71X) and responded to a follow-up survey (Qualtrics Link: http://bit.ly/3jMWvvv). Participants identified themselves as either ECE providers (n = 77) or other stakeholders (n = 30), who can offer opportunities or guidance to providers.
<h3 class="anchored">
Measurable Outcome/Analysis
</h3>
Change in self-reported evaluation score (range 1=low to 7=high) for understanding, behavioral intention to implement knowledge, and confidence about how to feed children responsively during plated meal service. Paired sample <i>t</i> tests (alpha = 0.05) followed by Sidak-Bonferroni correction (adjusted <i>P</i> = 0.007).
<h3 class="anchored">
Results
</h3>
Both providers and stakeholders reported significantly higher (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) level of understanding, intention to implement knowledge obtained, and confidence regarding implementing responsive feeding during plated meal service after the webinar compared to before the webinar. Participants expressed need for online nutrition trainings with emerging themes such as feeding infants, safe food preparation and storage, flexibility of CACFP rules, and physical distance during meals.
<h3 class="anchored">
Conclusion
</h3>
<p>Intentional mealtime conversations, giving children small tasks supporting their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and setting clear expectations while adjusting mealtime routines can offer a promising avenue for implementing responsive feeding during plated meal service.</p>

<p>The article examines the content and application of the principle of inadmissibility of interference in family life. It is established that the principle of inadmissibility of interference in family life is one of the key in family law and contains signs of intersectoral. Proper guarantee of non-interference in family life is an integral part of a person’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and an indicator of the state’s fulfillment of the obligation to regulate family relations only to a minimum.
 She studied the provisions of international acts (the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms) and the national legislation of Ukraine. It was found that different terminology is used in international and national acts, but the fixed concepts are meaningful content of the principle of inadmissibility of interference in family life.
 An analysis of the case law of the European Court of Human Rights on the understanding of the concept of “family life”. It has been established that the ECtHR interprets the term “family life” quite broadly and is not limited to marital relations, but may cover other actual “family ties”.
 Attention is drawn to the problem of collecting private information about a person via the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. Analysis of human activity on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> in general, as well as on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networks should not be carried out without his consent. That is why it is proposed at the level of legislation to provide for the obligation of both developers of computer programs that analyze human actions and collect information about them, and owners of site</span>s on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> when visiting them to warn people that such actions can be traced.
 The positive responsibilities of the state to guarantee respect for family life, protection from others, as well as to establish legal certainty in family relations and protect the secrecy of family life were analyzed.
 It is substantiated that the principle of inadmissibility of interference in family life is a principle enshrined in written law, which provides for respect for family life, prohibition of any illegal, arbitrary interference in family life, as well as protection of the secrecy of family life.</p>

<p>The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things is emerging as a vast, inter-connected space of devices and things surrounding people, many of which are increasingly capable of autonomous action, from automatically sending data to cloud servers for analysis, changing the behaviour of smart objects, to changing the physical environment. A wide range of ethical concerns has arisen in their usage and development in recent years. Such concerns are exacerbated by the increasing <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> given to connected things. This paper reviews, via examples, the landscape of ethical issues, and some recent approaches to address these issues concerning connected things behaving autonomously as part of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things. We consider ethical issues in relation to device operations and accompanying algorithms. Examples of concerns include unsecured consumer devices, data collection with health-related <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things, hackable vehicles, behaviour of autonomous vehicles in dilemma situations, accountability with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things systems, algorithmic bias, uncontrolled cooperation among things, and automation affecting user choice and control. Current ideas towards addressing a range of ethical concerns are reviewed and compared, including programming ethical behaviour, white-box algorithms, black-box validation, algorithmic social contracts, enveloping IoT systems, and guidelines and code of ethics for IoT developers; a suggestion from the analysis is that a multi-pronged approach could be useful based on the context of operation and deployment.</p>

<p>Nowadays, the Portuguese population is aging at a fast pace. The situation is more severe in the interior regions of the country, where the rural areas have few people and have been constantly losing population; these are mostly elderly who, in some cases, live socially isolated. They are also often deprived of some types of social, health and technological services. One of the current challenges with respect to the elderly is that of improving the quality of life for those who still have some <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and live in their own residences so that they may continue living autonomously, while receiving the assistance of some exterior monitoring and supporting services. The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things (IoT) paradigm demonstrates great potential for creating technological solutions in this area as it aims to seamlessly integrate information technology with the daily lives of people. In this context, it is necessary to develop services that monitor the activity and health of the elderly in real time and alert caregivers or other family members in the case of an unusual event or behaviour. It is crucial that the technological system is able to collect data in a nonintrusive manner and without requiring much interaction with the elderly. Smartband devices are very good candidates for this purpose and, therefore, this work proposes assessing the level of acceptance of the usage of a smartbands by senior users in their daily activities. By using the definition of an architecture and the development of a prototype, it was possible to test the level of acceptance of smartbands by a sample of the elderly population—with surprising results from both the elderly and the caregivers—which constitutes an important contribution to the research field of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL). The evaluation showed that most users did not feel that the smartband was intrusive to their daily tasks and even considered using it in the future, while caregivers considered that the platform was very intuitive.</p>

Its strength is in helping students compose pragmatically appropriate texts which could substantially increase their confidence and the feeling of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. It accomplishes this by providing writers with tone indications of their text paired with emojis to help navigate the sometimes opaque waters of pragmatics. However, this tool does not provide indications of which words or phrases contribute to an indicated tone, nor does it offer suggestions for improvement. It is a perpetual beta tool in that it asks for user input to continually adapt and learn to the changing communicative situation. Although there are some areas for improvement, it is a useful tool that teachers could recommend to their students to support their ability to raise their confidence about the pragmatic appropriateness when writing <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s and other texts where pragmatics are important.</p>

<p>Introduction: Adolescence is a phase involving risk taking, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, adventure and efforts to fit into adulthood. Physical and emotional changes, peers, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, education, family expectations etc. make individuals vulnerable. Aims: To study the prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress in school going adolescents from 9th -12th standard from Bagdogra, to examine the association with family factors and Socio Economic Status and to identify the co-morbidities between Depression, Anxiety and Stress. Methods: A cross sectional study was carried out using DASS-21 scale on a total of 231 students. In addition, a self-structured questionnaire on family structure and socio economic status was administered and SPSS software was used for analysis. Result: Overall, 76.2% had at least one of the mental morbidities under study. Depression was significantly more common in class 12th, (28.4%), 9th (28.4%) &amp;10th (27.6%) and stress was significantly common in 12th(55.4%) &amp; 10th (55.2%). There was no significant difference in relation to age, sex, family structure and socioeconomic status. All mental morbidities more frequently occurred in combination with each other, rather than exclusively. Depression most frequently occurred with stress (8 times) followed by anxiety (4 times), whereas anxiety was 6 times more likely to occur with stress. Conclusions: Almost 3 out of 4 children had symptoms related to at least one of the mental morbidities discussed. Depression and stress was significantly more prevalent in students answering board exams (class 10th and 12th) than those not answering board exams. Depression, Anxiety and Stress were highly correlated with each other.</p>

<p>BackgroundSince 2014, many companies have followed the lead of Apple and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> and now offer financial support to female employees to access egg freezing. Australian companies may soon make similar offers. Employer-sponsored egg freezing (ESEF) has raised concerns and there is academic debate about whether ESEF promotes reproductive <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> or reinforces the ‘career vs.&nbsp;family’ dichotomy. Despite the growing availability of ESEF and significant academic debate, little is known about how ESEF is perceived by the public. The aim of this study was to explore women’s attitudes toward ESEF.MethodsWomen aged 18-60 years who resided in Victoria, Australia were invited to complete an online, cross-sectional survey investigating views toward egg freezing. Associations between participant demographics and their views about ESEF were assessed using multinominal logistic regression, adjusted for age and free text comments were analyzed using thematic analysis.ResultsThe survey was completed by 656 women, median age 28 years (range: 18-60 years). Opinions on the appropriateness of employers offering ESEF were divided (Appropriate: 278, 42%; Inappropriate: 177, 27%; Unsure: 201, 31%). There was significantly less support for ESEF among older participants and those employed part-time (p &lt; 0.05). While some participants saw the potential for ESEF to increase women’s reproductive and career options, others were concerned that ESEF could pressure women to delay childbearing and exacerbate existing inequities in access to ARTs.ConclusionsOur analysis revealed that while some women identified risks with ESEF, for many women ESEF is not viewed as theoretically wrong, but rather it may be acceptable under certain conditions; such as with protections around reproductive freedoms and assurances that ESEF is offered alongside other benefits that promote career building and family. We suggest that there may be a role for the State in ensuring that these conditions are met.</p>

<p>The Fundamental Reform Document of Education, IRI was approved by the Supreme Council of Cultural Revolution in 2011. Based on different reports and studies, however, it seems that a decade after approval, not only the majority of its operational strategies have not been implemented, but its setting and establishment is still in a state of ambiguity. As school’s educational staff are the most crucial element of implementing such a document, this survey measures school readiness and staff familiarity. In this case, the survey method was used comprises the number of 129 educational staff working in public and private schools at different levels elementary, middle, and high schools including girls and boys) was studied in Tehran and Kerman provinces. Results showed that educational staff is familiar with the Fundamental Reform Document of Education, its theoretical foundation, and subsequently with its six subsystems, respectively. The readiness of schools to implement the Fundamental Reform Document of Education is also as follows: 81% for the relationship between schools and institutions, 77% for educational staffs readiness, 76% fostering affairs, 73% for the preparedness of classrooms, workshops, and laboratories, 72% for teachers with professional experiences, 71% for access to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> infrastructure, 66% for sports space, facilities, and equipment, 65% for schools’ institutional <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for decision-making, and 56% for financial resources. At the final stage of this article, we submitted a model for utilizing the school’s capacity to implement the Fundamental Reform Document of Education. https://dorl.net/dor /20.1001.1.20088302.2021.19.2.11.9</p>

<p>The objectives of this study were to compare the impact of peer feedback implementation with teacher involvement through training in the classroom and asynchronous <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communication</span> on the quality of students’ writing revisions, as well as to investigate students’ perceptions of peer feedback activities. Twenty-five students participated in the experimental study. Eleven students were willingly to be interviewed. Inferential statistical analysis was used to interpret the quantitative data collected from students’ essay writing scores. Meanwhile, the data obtained through observations and interviews was interpreted using qualitative coding analysis. The results of the inferential statistical analysis revealed that peer feedback activities conducted through asynchronous online interactions had more significant effects compared to those conducted face to face on students’ writing revision. Further, after conducting a thematic analysis, six themes emerged: 1) peer feedback activities could increase students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in learning, 2) the teacher’s involvement in peer feedback activities was beneficial in terms of improving the consistency of feedback and revision, 3) peer feedback through asynchronous online interactions gave extra time to produce more beneficial comments, 4) peer feedback activities through asynchronous online interactions gave more chances to become a writing audience, 5) communicating via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> made the students feel awkward, and 6) recorded feedback via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> comments was more beneficial for students’ revision. The implication of the research is that teachers of English needs to consider asynchronous online interactions for students’ writing revision when teaching writing.</p>

<i> Asaf Harduf </i></p>
<p>Rape is the most severe sexual offense, involving one of the most feared and reviled acts a person can inflict on another. But what makes something rape? Initially, only penial-vagina forceful penetration; then, other forceful penial penetrations were added, oral and anal; and later the forceful insertion of inanimate objects as well. The requirement of using force lost its exclusiveness and much of its normative power, paving the way for other kinds of rape: sex by non-forceful coercion, sex by sedation, sex with incompetent victims, sex by fraud, and other forms of problematic sex. The normative debate about each form is ongoing, and in a manner of speaking, rape is a limitless idea. Where will the rape offense go next?</p>
<p><span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span>space, apparently. The Israeli Supreme Court has recently affirmed convictions of rape performed by distant words. The perpetrators conversed with children, teenagers and adult women online, using fraud and blackmail to manipulate them into masturbation and self-penetration. This groundbreaking judicial development is the inspiration to a normative analysis, revolving around Western notions of rape. Should such ill-intended communications constitute rape?</p>
<p>The article will normatively scrutinize the virtual rape thesis. It will analytically deconstruct the normative notion of rape into three facets, and examine each separately: the physics of the offensive scenario; the settings thereof, the manner in which sexual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is violated; and finally, the matter of proper criminal labeling. It will conclude that while sexual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is indeed under attack in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>space, the framework of rape is unsuitable to handle this form of offensiveness.</p>

<p>This study explored the impact of assistive technology on the well-being of legally blind adults.In this mixed-method study, a convenience sample of 86 legally blind adults took an electronic survey. The questionnaire was comprised of demographics, use patterns, and an instrument called TENS-Interface that measured the impact of technology on well-being categories of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness. Descriptive statistics, reliability, power analysis and bivariate correlations were calculated using SPSS statistical software. Three participants completed follow up semi-structured interviews, which were analysed for themes of technological mediation using NVivo 12 software.The TENS-Interface was validated for use with a legally blind population. Descriptive statistics showed a higher mean for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> than competence or relatedness. Braille was positively correlated to both <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and competence, while screen reader proficiency was related to competence. Daily use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">instant mess</span>aging, and video calls were correlated to relatedness. The technological devices used by interview participants were analysed for technological mediation. Training was identified as an additional theme.Recommendations for practice include providing training to legally blind adults in screen reader use and braille use to support well-being via competence and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Training is also recommended for this population in the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>, and video calls to promote well-being through opportunities for relatedness. Further research is recommended to explore instructional methods that are not only efficient, but also meaningful for older adults in the position of losing their vision.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONProviding access to braille instruction and braille assistive technology equipment can promote legally blind adults’ well-being by supporting their basic needs for both competence and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.Providing training in screen reader use can promote legally blind adults’ well-being by supporting their basic need for competence.Providing training in use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, video calls, and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">instant mess</span>aging can promote legally blind adults’ well-being by supporting their basic need for relatedness.A consideration of technological mediation can allow practitioners to make recommendations that take into account not only efficient task completion, but issues related to meaning and social context.Instruction for adults losing their vision adventitiously needs to address not only efficient task performance, but also meaning and social context.</p>

<p>In the COVID-19 pandemic, human solidarity plays a crucial role in meeting this maybe greatest modern societal challenge. Public health communication targets enhancing collective compliance with protective health and safety regulations. Here, we asked whether authoritarian/controlling message framing as compared to a neutral message framing may be more effective than moralizing/prosocial message framing and whether recipients’ self-rated trait <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> might lessen these effects. In a German sample (n = 708), we measured approval of seven regulations (e.g., reducing contact, wearing a mask) before and after presenting one of three <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span> messages (authoritarian, moralizing, neutral/control) presented by either a high-authority sender (state secretary) or a low-authority sender (social worker). We found that overall, the messages successfully increased participants’ endorsement of the regulations, but only weakly so because of ceiling effects. Highly autonomous participants showed more consistent responses across the two measurements, i.e., lower response shifting, in line with the concept of reactive <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Specifically, when the sender was a social worker, response shifting correlated negatively with trait <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. We suggest that a trusted sender encourages more variable responses to imposed societal regulations in individuals low in <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and we discuss several aspects that may improve health communication.</p>

<p>This is a review of the extant literature on inhibitors to the electronic teaching and learning of Library and Information Science (LIS) in Nigerian universities. The university-wide inhibitors as identified by the study are non-provision or inadequacy of: funding, administrative and infrastructural supports, functional ICT laboratories/tools, ICT-compliant teaching staff and standby and responsive technical support for both teachers and students. Library schools’ inhibitors include poor maintenance culture, lack of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> presence, dedicated bandwidth and active websites while the teaching and learning inhibitors highlighted by the study are (older) teachers’ poor attitude, concerns on how to retain the copyright of their lecture contents, plagiarism and the quality of students’ work; fear of additional workload which may result in stress and burnt-out; lack of freedom or teaching <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (as teaching may now take the collaborations of colleagues, computer experts and instructional/graphic designers); teachers’/students’ poor expertise and technology background and nature of course, among others. The author made suggestions on the way forward for an increased and a sustainable integration of ICTs in teaching and learning, especially in this Post-COVID-19 Pandemic Era where physical contact and interactions may need to be reduced to the barest minimum to contain contagious communication and consequent health hazards. This review has implications for library educators, students and educational managers in the universities of other developing countries.</p>

<p>The purpose of this study is to explore the mechanism and boundary condition of the relationship between enterprise <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use and job performance. This study used a two-wave design, with a final sample of 481 employees from an automobile company. The results indicate that enterprise <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use is positively related to both work overload and informational support. Work overload and informational support predicts job performance negatively and positively, respectively. Furthermore, work overload and informational support mediates the relationship between enterprise <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use and job performance. Job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> moderates the relationship between enterprise <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use and work overload and informational support. Therefore, this study provides a more balanced view of how enterprise <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use influences job performance by demonstrating the opposing mediating roles of work overload and informational support. Furthermore, this study fills the gap by taking job characteristics into more consideration when examining the boundary condition of enterprise <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use. Last, this study validates the generalization of job demands-resources model in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> research.</p>

<p>Scholarly attention to hashtagging on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> sites has focused on their catagorization affordances. Grounded in the literature on online identity, this article examines how Tumblr users tactically use hashtagging architecture for publicity and privacy in self-expression. The analysis is based on Tumblr posts and their corresponding hashtags, combined with text-based, synchronous interviews with users. We find that participants use hashtags as a form of intimate expression, offering “secret whisper” spaces. Participants acknowledged a distinction between these spaces of intimacy and the more conventional space of the post. Extending on Goffman’s dramaturgical approach, we argue that this intimacy practice is a form of stage whispering, which is neither front- nor backstage, but implies and assumes intimacy while on the stage, as an actor might imply and assume intimacy stage whispering to her audience.</p>

<p>Pervasive technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things, despite their great potential for improved workability and well-being of older workers, entail wide ethical concerns. Aligned with these considerations we emphasize the need to present from the viewpoint of ethics the risks of personalized ICT solutions that aim to remedy health and support the well-being of the ageing population at workplaces. The ethical boundaries of digital technologies are opaque. The main motivation is to cope with the uncertainties of workplaces’ digitization and develop an ethics framework, termed SmartFrameWorK, for personalized health support through ICT tools at workplace environments. SmartFrameWorK is built upon a five-dimensional approach of ethics norms: <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, privacy, transparency, trustworthiness and accountability to incite trust in digital workplace technologies. A typology underpins these principles and guides the ethical decision-making process with regard to older worker particular needs, context, data type-related risks and digital tools’ use throughout their lifecycle. Risk analysis of pervasive technology use and multimodal data collection, highlighted the imperative for ethically aware practices for older workers’ activity and behaviour monitoring. The SmartFrameWorK methodology has been applied in a case study to provide evidence that personalized digital services could elicit trust in users through a well-defined framework. Ethics compliance is a dynamic process from participants’ engagement to data management. Defining ethical determinants is pivotal towards building trust and reinforcing better workability and well-being in older workers.</p>

<p>Exercise is an effective intervention to prevent falls in older adults; however, long-term adherence is often poor. To increase adherence, additional support for behavior change has been advocated. However, consistency in the reporting of interventions using behavior change techniques is lacking. Recently, a classification system has been developed to increase consistency in studies using behavior change techniques within the self-determination theory.This study aimed to explore expressions of self-determination among community-dwelling older adults using a self-managed digital fall prevention exercise program comprising behavior change support (the Safe Step program), which was developed in co-creation with intended users.The qualitative study design was based on open-ended responses to questionnaires, and individual and focus group interviews. A deductive qualitative content analysis was applied using the classification system of motivation and behavior change techniques as an analytical matrix, followed by an inductive analysis. Twenty-five participants took part in a feasibility study and exercised in their homes with the Safe Step program for 4 months. The exercise program was available on computers, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s, and tablets, and was fully self-managed.In the deductive analysis, expressions of support were demonstrated for all three basic human psychological needs, namely, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness. These expressions were related to 11 of the 21 motivation and behavior change techniques in the classification system. The inductive analysis indicated that <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (to be in control) was valued and enabled individual adaptations according to different rationales for realizing exercise goals. However, the experience of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> was also two-sided and depended on the participants’ competence in exercise and the use of technology. The clarity of the program and exercise videos was seen as key for support in performance and competent choices. Although augmented techniques for social support were requested, support through relatedness was found within the program.In this study, the Safe Step program supported the establishment of new exercise routines, as well as the three basic human psychological needs, with <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and competence being expressed as central in this context. Based on the participants’ experiences, a proposed addition to the classification system used as an analytical matrix has been presented.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02916849; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02916849.</p>

Where global demand outweighs the supply of mental health services, established interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) have been adapted from traditional face-to-face interaction to technology-assisted formats. One such notable development is the emergence of Artificially Intelligent (AI) conversational agents for psychotherapy. Pre-pandemic, these adaptations had demonstrated some positive results; but they also generated debate due to a number of ethical and societal challenges. This article commences with a critical overview of both positive and negative aspects concerning the role of AI-CBT in its present form. Thereafter, an ethical framework is applied with reference to the themes of (1) beneficence, (2) non-maleficence, (3) <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, (4) justice, and (5) explicability. These themes are then discussed in terms of practical recommendations for future developments. Although automated versions of therapeutic support may be of appeal during times of global crises, ethical thinking should be at the core of AI-CBT design, in addition to guiding research, policy, and real-world implementation as the world considers post-COVID-19 society.</p>

<p>This study describes 26 English language teaching faculty members’ and 32 preservice English as a foreign language teachers’ emergency remote teaching experiences and emotions. Verbal data gathered through an online questionnaire with open questions were analyzed using semidirected content analysis. Most faculty and all students reported negative feelings, which were connected with some faculty members’ focus on delivering content without interaction and with insufficient <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> access. Some students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> allowed them to overcome the first of these challenges. Teachers with online education training reported better experiences. Thus, universities and the State must provide more training and equipment to close the digital gap and ensure effective emergency remote teaching.</p>

<p>This article outlines bioethical issues related to the application of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Body (IoB) technology in health care so-called medical IoB devices. Manufacturers of medical IoB devices promise to provide significant health benefits, improved treatment outcomes and other benefits, but such IoB also carry serious risks to health and life, including the risks of hacking (<span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>hacking), malfunctioning, receiving false positive measurements, breaching privacy, deliberate invasion of privacy. In addition, medical IoB products can directly cause physical harm to the human body. As human flesh is intertwined with hardware, software, and algorithms, the IoB will test our social values and ethics. In particular, IoB will challenge notions of human <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and self-government as they threaten to undermine the fundamental precondition of human <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Thus, the protection of human <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> should become the main ethical principle of the use of medical IoB devices.</p>

<p>Emergency remote teaching was regulated by the National Council of Education through Decision nº5/2020, approved on April 28th 2020, in Brazil, as an alternative to cover for the absence of face-to-face teaching. The Ordinance states that remote teaching activities must be applied to students of all education levels, steps, and modalities. As such, the main objective of this study was to investigate, through a bibliographic research, what are the skills that teachers of high ability/gifted students should have in the context of remote classes. We undertook a qualitative bibliographic research by surveying material readily available for consulting on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>, such as educational books, periodic publications, and laws pertaining to high ability/gifted students and their learning process. After sorting through this material, we conducted an analysis to discuss data and later compiled suggestions of potential methodologies that could be applied to online classrooms. Our findings emphasize that both teaching knowledge and practice must offer high ability/gifted students optimized challenges, which integrate provocative novelties and motivate the development of their abilities and the dynamicity in activities. Furthermore, they also foster the students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, making individual interests deeper, as well as their creative, critical and research abilities. Therefore, active learning methodologies are an asset to the teaching-learning process of students with specific educational needs.</p>

<p>The Proposal for an Artificial Intelligence Act, published by the European Commission in April 2021, marks a major step in the governance of artificial intelligence (AI). This paper examines the significance of this Act for the electricity sector, specifically investigating to what extent the current European Union Bill addresses the societal and governance challenges posed by the use of AI that affects the tasks of system operators. For this we identify various options for the use of AI by system operators, as well as associated risks. AI has the potential to facilitate grid management, flexibility asset management and electricity market activities. Associated risks include lack of transparency, decline of human <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security, market dominance, and price manipulation on the electricity market. We determine to what extent the current bill pays attention to these identified risks and how the European Union intends to govern these risks. The proposed AI Act addresses well the issue of transparency and clarifying responsibilities, but pays too little attention to risks related to human <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security, market dominance and price manipulation. We make some governance suggestions to address those gaps.</p>

<p>Introduction: Adolescents are vulnerable to addictions such as tobacco, alcohol, pornography, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> use etc. Due to high exposure to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and gadgets, the involvement of adolescents in digital gaming has increased significantly in recent years. Excessive digital gaming may affect the mental health status. Aim: To measure the prevalence of digital gaming and to assess the relationship between digital gaming and psychological well-being among college going adolescents. Materials and Methods: A college based cross-sectional study was conducted among 415 adolescents (≤19 years of age) studying in arts, engineering and medical colleges located in Puducherry. The study participants were recruited using stratified multistage sampling technique. After obtaining written informed consent, study participants were interviewed using a structured questionnaire consisting of variables such as socio-demography, usage and pattern of digital gaming. Gaming Addiction Scale was used to assess the level of addiction to digital gaming. Psychological well-being score was assessed using 42 items Ryff’s scale with six domains such as <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relations with others, purpose in life and self-acceptance. Data was analysed in IBM SPSS Statistics for windows, Version 21.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, New York). Chi-square test and one-way ANOVA tests were used to measure the p-value, p&lt;0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: Out of 415 study participants, 83.1% were current or past players of digital games. Females (93%) ever played more than males (74%) (p&lt;0.001). The proportion of current/past gamers was lowest in the participants aged 17 years (49.1%) (p&lt;0.001). All engineering and arts students (100%) played the digital games either currently or in past, however it was only 48.9% among medical students (p&lt;0.001). Majority (53.6%) played in both online and offline mode. About three-fourth (76.2%) of the study participants were playing digital games at their homes. The proportion of daily playing digital gamers was higher in females (28.6%) than males (23.4%) but statistically not significant (p=0.215). A 29% of the study participants felt bad when they were unable to play games. The prevalence of addictive and problematic users among those who were playing digital games was 4.3% and 33.6%, respectively. The mean score of self-acceptance dimension of psychological well-being was lowest among current users than past and never users with statistical significance (p=0.046). However, the dimension of personal growth was higher among current and never users than past users (p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: Most of the college going adolescents had ever played digital games. There was no significant relationship between psychological well-being and digital gaming except for personal growth and self-acceptance dimensions.</p>

<p>People increasingly provide feedback about healthcare services online. These practices have been lauded for enhancing patient power, choice and control, encouraging greater transparency and accountability, and contributing to healthcare service improvement. Online feedback has also been critiqued for being unrepresentative, spreading inaccurate information, undermining care relations, and jeopardising professional <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Through a thematic analysis of 37 qualitative interviews, this paper explores the relationship between online feedback and care improvement as articulated by healthcare service users (patients and family members) who provided feedback across different online platforms and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> in the UK. Online feedback was framed by interviewees as, ideally, a public and, in many cases, anonymous ‘conversation’ between service users and healthcare providers. These ‘conversations’ were thought of not merely as having the potential to bring about tangible improvements to healthcare, but as in themselves constituting an improvement in care. Vital to this was the premise that providing feedback was an enactment of care - care for other patients, certainly, but also care for healthcare as such and even for healthcare professionals. Ultimately, feedback was understood as an enactment of care for the National Health Service (NHS), as symbolically encompassing all of the above. Putting these findings in dialogue with STS scholarship on care, we argue that, in this context, the provision of online feedback can be understood as a form of care that is, simultaneously, both directed at healthcare (in the round, including patients, professionals, services, organisations, and, of course, health itself) and part of healthcare. We conceptualise this as ‘caring for care’. This conceptualization moves beyond dominant framings of online feedback in terms of ‘choice’ and ‘voice’. It embeds online feedback within pre-existing healthcare systems, relations and moral commitments, foregrounds the mutuality of care relations, and draws attention to the affective labour of feedback practices.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and communication technolog</span>ies, or ICTs, have gained importance in the globalized world. Meanwhile, they are also a challenge for teachers, who might be reflecting on their teaching practices. The following paper reports on a study developed with sixth graders at a public institution in Tunja, Colombia. The study was implemented during the first semester of 2016, and its goal was to develop speaking skills through workshops organized on a web page. Data was collected through field notes, students’ artifacts, recordings, and questionnaires. The results showed that the use of ICTs caught the students’ attention, encouraged them to speak English, and increased their vocabulary. Being able to speak and understand more vocabulary could help students use the language in real life situations, as well as reinforce their learning <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.</p>

<p>It is widely accepted that digital technologies (popularly known as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies or ICT) have the potential to strengthen and reform school education. However, in the absence of clear framework for program design, the impact on learning processes and outcomes from numerous attempts by different governments and other actors has not lived up to this potential. This note provides a holistic framework for such a design, covering infrastructure, teacher education, curriculum and content and education administration, aiming to support the creation of an ecosystem of ICT integration. The note assumes certain principles- firstly ICT program should aim to support the achievement of educational aims. A deep understanding of aims, philosophies, contexts, needs and priorities of education in India, is indispensable for meaningful and effective program design.</p>
<p>Secondly, ICT implementation must support the achievement of education policy. The thrust of these policies has been to support constructivist classroom pedagogies, make learning connected to local contexts and responsive to learner needs, make the school culture democratic and participatory, support decentralized school system administration by strengthening school <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, teacher agency and connecting the school to the local community, going beyond a narrow focus on learning outcomes. The ‘public’ nature of education aligns strongly with free and open ICT architectures. It is recommended by the National ICT policy that the ICT implementation in school education use free and open technologies, including FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) and OER (Open Educational Resources). The design of ICT programs must consciously aim for sustainability, where the schools and other institutions can continue the integration of ICT beyond the initial investment period. Developing in-house capacities of teachers and teacher educators to appropriate free and open ICTs for their work, can sustain the use of ICT, freed from vendor lock-ins. Using ICT to build peer networks of teachers can support continuing professional development and sustain ICT implementation in the school.</p>

<p>This study was an attempt to investigate whether using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Instagram</span> had any significant effects on Iranian intermediate autonomous/dependent EFL learners’ pictorial metaphors or not. In doing so, Oxford Placement Test was administered among100 EFL learners studying at Rooyesh language institute in Kelishad, Isfahan, Iran; and based on the results, 80 EFL learners were selected. Then, the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> test was conducted to divide them into autonomous and dependent groups. In the next step, they were divided into two equal experimental and control groups (N=40) that each group was subdivided to an autonomous and a dependent group (i.e., 20 autonomous and 20 dependent participants in each CG and EG). Their age ranged between 14 and 18 years old. Gender of participants was not considered as a variable in the study. Next, a metaphorical expression pretest was administered to all groups of the study and then the experimental group was given the metaphorical expressions via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Instagram</span> application, whereas the control group only followed conventional treatment. At the end, the posttest of L2 metaphorical expression was administered to both groups of the study and finally the data were analyzed.

<p>While the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> by local governments has gained relevance in recent years, crises are critical situations that reinforce the need to reach citizens to disclose information, demonstrate the government’s commitment, and increase the citizens’ level of preparedness and awareness of resources. This paper examines the factors that influenced local governments’ e-disclosure during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. To accomplish this objective, we systematically tracked every post published by the official <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> page of 304 Portuguese municipalities between March 2 and July 5, 2020. The findings show that financial <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is the main predictor of e-disclosure, factors varied on the different phases of the pandemic’s first wave, and sociodemographic factors became more prevalent as explanatory factors when the crisis worsened. Our study may help increase the level of preparedness during possible future crises. In particular, establishing communication strategies for prolonged public health crises, making financial resources available for the accomplishment of such strategies, and reducing the digital divide can contribute to more effective disclosure. Future research should explore the dynamics of disclosure during public health crises. This study also highlights the need to incorporate time in research that focuses on the determinants of e-disclosure that could also be tested in normal times.</p>

The main purpose of this research was to explore the effects of ICT engagement factors on science performance across Singapore and Turkey conditional to the sufficient degree of measurement invariance of ICT engagement scale. The multi-group confirmatory factor analysis results demonstrated strong factorial invariance of ICT engagement scale across Singapore and Turkey, so we were able to use ICT engagement scale to meaningful and valid comparisons between these countries. After obtaining measurement invariance, a multi-group structural equation modeling was used for the comparison of the effects of ICT engagement factors on student’s performance of science between these two countries. While interest in ICT, perceived ICT competence and perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in using ICT have significant positive direct effect on science performance in both countries, the direct effect of social relatedness in using ICT on science performance is negative in both Singapore and Turkey. Also, when compared with Singapore, the effects of all ICT engagement constructs on student’s performance are higher in Turkey.

<i> Philipp Reisner </i></p>
<p>In the recent rise of digital learning, “flipped classrooms” have become a controversial subject. This new form of learning inverts the traditional conception of the classroom: instruction is transferred from the classroom to out-of-class (online) tasks such as pre-recorded lectures on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, while class time is devoted to activities that put the knowledge into practice. These classrooms have been touted as learner-based and student-centered models of education. Yet there is still little evidence supporting the effectiveness of the flipped classroom at higher levels of education, especially in the humanities. Taking American studies as an example, I will examine some of the arguments in favor of this model, but also and most importantly some of the challenges facing the application of this new educational model in the humanities. In general, the main concern is that flipped classrooms may undermine student-teacher dialogue, viewing teachers as “moderators” who design learning environments geared to the students. At the same time, home-learning environments may compromise learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and limit learners’ opportunities for self-organized work and interaction with peers outside class. Ultimately, a critique of the concept of flipped classrooms is also a critique of the egalitarian aspirations of digital pedagogy in general.</p>

<p>This article examines the legal and normative foundations of media content regulation in the borderless networked society. We explore the extent to which <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> undertakings should be subject to state regulation, in light of Canada’s ongoing debates and legislative reform. We bring a cross-disciplinary perspective (from the subject fields of law; communications studies, in particular McLuhan’s now classic probes; international relations; and technology studies) to enable both policy and language analysis. We apply the concept of sovereignty to states (national cultural and digital sovereignty), media platforms (transnational sovereignty), and citizens (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and personal data sovereignty) to examine the competing dynamics and interests that need to be considered and mediated. While there is growing awareness of the tensions between state and transnational media platform powers, the relationship between media content regulation and the collection of viewers’ personal data is relatively less explored. We analyse how future media content regulation needs to fully account for personal data extraction practices by transnational platforms and other media content undertakings. We posit national cultural sovereignty—a constant unfinished process and framework connecting the local to the global—as the enduring force and justification of media content regulation in Canada. The exercise of state sovereignty may be applied not so much to secure strict territorial borders and centralized power over citizens but to act as a mediating power to promote and protect citizens’ individual and collective interests, locally and globally.</p>

<p>Abstract While life expectancy increases in developed countries and there is evidence that demonstrates the potential of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> to optimise or compensate for the losses associated with ageing, there is a high proportion of older people who continue to be disconnected from the digital world. In this scenario, the technological support offered by public institutions has the potential to be an accessible source for the digital literacy of older people. This study, using the model of digital inequality, had the aim of analysing the ability of these institutional supports to determine and predict the digital inclusion of older people. The sample was retired adults (over 54 years) residing in Spain who are users of technological support services in four organisational contexts: nursing homes, senior community centres, University Programs for Seniors and adult education programmes. Through binary logistic regression analysis, we found that the ability of the availability of literacy support to determine and predict access, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, skills and use of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> for social connectivity depends on the social and organisational context of the technology support service. These findings support empirically the situated nature of technological support for the digital inclusion of older people and provide a useful comparative vision for the design of accessible support services adapted to the needs of its users.</p>

<p>Organizations must adapt to the trend of digitalization. Nowadays, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> engagement editors play an increasingly crucial role for organizational growth and prosperity in the digital age. Engagement editors are usually tasked to perform the functions of marketing, content production, and data analysis. They have to manage <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>ies on behalf of the organization, and encounter online audiences’ frequent toxic and aggressive behaviors. Engagement editors thus are prone to emotional stress. Substantial literature has examined the influence of leadership style on employee performance. However, passive leadership is rarely studied. This research investigates (1) whether passive leadership would negatively affect engagement editors’ performance (i.e., online interaction with audiences); and (2) how the negativity would be ameliorated by certain organizational policies (i.e., job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>) and their individual attributes (i.e., employee resilience) from the conservation of resource perspective. We surveyed 122 engagement editors and used the smartPLS 3.2.9 to analyze the data. This research provides important theoretical and practical implications.</p>

<p>The data from world researches of gifted adolescents who are addicted from the virtual environment and their peers is presented in the article. The theoretical foundations of gifted adolescents’ addiction prevention from the virtual environment are presented. Various currents of researchers’ views on the adolescents’ giftedness factor and the associated addiction risks on the virtual environment are shown. Conclusions about the urgent need to prevent this phenomenon are drawn. The risk factors for the addiction emergence of gifted adolescents on the virtual environment have been identified. The model of addiction prevention on the virtual environment is described. Teenage age – transitional age which is characterized by all systems of an organism formation. During this period perhaps unstable condition of the teenager’s nervous system strengthened by daily stressor which accumulatingly can generate a stress. All these factors can provoke an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>-dependent behavior emergence among the presented and not gifted teenagers therefore prospect of further researches is gifted teenagers’ dependence on the virtual environment correction program creation. On the given results basis of the world researches on dependence on the virtual environment, namely <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> dependence, we had a vision of gifted teenagers’ dependence process which we presented in the form of dependence prevention theoretical model which we also use further in practice. According to our model of gifted teenagers’ dependence prevention on the virtual environment, personal labour is the component bringing out of dependence. The steady condition of a teenager’s nervous system is a basis of dependence prevention. The <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the teenager’s identity is an integrated basis of dependence prevention on the virtual environment. Facing considered by us researches’ results about increase in destructive use of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> by teenagers, further work on prevention and correction of gifted teenagers’ dependence on the virtual environment seems necessary to us</p>

<p>Recent advances in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things (IoT) technologies and the reduction in the cost of sensors have encouraged the development of smart environments, such as smart homes. Smart homes can offer home assistance services to improve the quality of life, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and health of their residents, especially for the elderly and dependent. To provide such services, a smart home must be able to understand the daily activities of its residents. Techniques for recognizing human activity in smart homes are advancing daily. But new challenges are emerging every day. In this paper, we present recent algorithms, works, challenges and taxonomy of the field of human activity recognition in a smart home through ambient sensors. Moreover, since activity recognition in smart homes is a young field, we raise specific problems, missing and needed contributions. But also propose directions, research opportunities and solutions to accelerate advances in this field.</p>

<p>Abstract Concertive control (CC) theory has primarily been applied to traditional offline, work-based, closed membership teams. New organizational forms such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>ies have opened up additional sites in which CC processes may operate. This article makes several contributions to CC theory and research. First, it increases the applicability of CC theory by extending it from offline to online, work to non-work, and closed to open membership contexts. Second, it increases our understanding of CC processes by elaborating on three mechanisms of CC (group <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, group identification, and generative discipline) and how they operate differently in online work/non-work and closed/open contexts. Third, it develops propositions about how these mechanisms interact with three prominent media affordances (visibility, persistence and editability) within those contexts. Extending CC theory to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>ies helps to explain individuals’ responses to normative group pressures online, which is highly relevant in our increasingly culturally and politically polarized society.</p>

<p>Abstract <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Smartphone</span> sensors allow measurement of phenomena that are difficult or impossible to capture via self-report (e.g., geographical movement, physical activity). Sensors can reduce respondent burden by eliminating survey questions and improve measurement accuracy by replacing/augmenting self-reports. However, if respondents who are not willing to collect sensor data differ on critical attributes from those who are, the results can be biased. Research on the mechanisms of willingness to collect sensor data mostly comes from (nonprobability) online panels and is hypothetical (i.e., asks participants about the likelihood of participation in a sensor-based study). In a cross-sectional general population randomized experiment, we investigate how features of the request and respondent characteristics influence willingness to share (WTS) and actually sharing <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>-sensor data. We manipulate the request to either mention or not mention (1) how participation will benefit the participant, (2) participants’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> over data collection, and (3) that data will be kept confidential. We assess nonparticipation bias using the administrative records. WTS and actually sharing varies by sensor task, participants’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> over data sharing, their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> skills, level of privacy concerns, and attitudes toward surveys. Fewer people agree to share photos and a video than geolocation, but all who agreed to share photos or a video actually did. Some nonresponse and nonparticipation biases are substantial and make each other worse, but others jointly reduce the overall bias. Our findings suggest that sensor-data-sharing decisions depend on sample members’ situation when asked to share and the nature of the sensor task rather than the sensor type.</p>

<p>Based on the characteristics of convenience, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and equality, online self-media has become an important way for contemporary migrant workers to observe the world, understand society, examine themselves and express their demands. On the basis of the analysis of the domestic migrant works’ concerns and their emotion analysis, we crawl data on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Weibo</span> about migrant works’ topics as the basic corpus of migrant works’ concerns, and then uses a combination of TF-IDF and Word2Vec methods to construct a recognition model of migrant workers’ concerns. We found that wages, children’s education, medical care and returning home are the main concerns of migrant workers. Meanwhile, further emotion analysis of the migrant works’ concerns of using a deep learning model fused with Bi-LSTM and CNN was conducted. The results show that the proportion of negative emotion such as worries, complaints and impetuosity was significantly higher than that of other positive and neutral emotion like encourage and comfort. And the time when the negative emotion are concentrated is significantly related to the social events that occur in the corresponding time period. On the one hand, it shows that the concerns and emotion of migrant workers can be effectively observed and predicted through web text data. On the other hand, it also shows that the core well-being issues of migrant workers in the process of urban integration have not been effectively solved, and the government and relevant departments need to take targeted measures and give priority attention.</p>

<p>The rapidly growing number of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things (IoT) devices poses new challenges for spectrum management in future wireless communication networks. It is critical to achieve efficient and dynamic spectrum management in the sixth-generation wireless communication networks (6G) era. To tackle the challenges of managing a large-scale IoT network with heterogeneous devices, we propose a directed acyclic graph (DAG) blockchain enhanced user-<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> spectrum sharing model. As the proposed consensus rule is closely related to system utility, the swarm intelligence of users gradually reaches the point of convergence in the process of blockchain consensus. We analyse the effect of the tip selection method of DAG blockchain on spectrum allocation utility. A dynamic tip selection method is proposed to enhance the global utility, which is related to the spectrum supply-demand. In addition, the ring signature technique is utilized to realize privacy protection during the sharing process. Simulation indicates that the proposed tip selection method achieves a 10% enhancement in terms of the global utility. Furthermore, significant reductions in administrative expense and reliability improvement are demonstrated by the simulation results. The stability of the tip number in the proposed model has been proved theoretically, which is also validated by simulation experiments.</p>

<p>The role of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s is vital in academia as interconnectivity in the classroom promotes learning <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, increases motivation, and enhances teaching and learning mobility. Using classroom research design, this study aimed to investigate the perspectives of Engineering students of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use in an academic writing course. The data were collected from students enrolled in a writing course in a top-ranked Science and Technology university in Thailand. Fifty students voluntarily submitted reflections towards the end of the semester. The study was qualitative, in which inductive coding was used. The findings elicited specific situations of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use in an academic writing course, for example, knowing and looking at the meaning of words, knowing the word form, finding information, taking notes, brainstorming with friends, using translation, and others. Two roles of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use were coded. The first role is facilitative, which has the following functions: resource-based, cognitive-based, memory-based, output-based, collaborative-based, entertainment-based, and communicative-based. Another is the debilitative role indicating two functions, such as sources of cognitive distraction and undesirable behaviors. Interestingly, self-regulation of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use in class was coded. Implications on how <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s can be used in teaching writing were also discussed.</p>

<p>&lt;p class=“0abstract”&gt;The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has brought the dependence on the online activities as new behaviors in various aspects of society including education. It defines the reliance upon <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> access for learning practices and the tendency toward learning <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Yet, the sudden emergence of the pandemic causes problematic circumstances for learners. Not all learners are ready to be autonomous and to have <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> infrastructure. Within this context, the current study addresses learners’ attitudes toward learning <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and examines what hinder them to be autonomous. As a descriptive research, this study involves 101 respondents living in Bitung city, a fast growing and harbor city in North Sulawesi, Eastern Indonesia. They are asked to fill the kind of Likert questionnaire which constitutes the source of data which are statistically analyzed. The results indicates that learners dominantly show positive attitude toward the idea of being autonomous in this pandemic era. In addition, several factors such as bad signal, distraction, self-discipline and lack of motivation occupy the dominant factors hinder learners to establish learning <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>Abstract Enterprise <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> (ESM) have largely gone ignored in discussions of the datafication practices of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms. This article presents an initial step towards filling this research gap. My research question in this article regards how employees of companies using the ESM Workplace from <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> feel that the implementation of this particular platform relates to their potential struggles for digital privacy and work–life segmentation. Methodologically, I explore this through a qualitative interview study of 21 Danish knowledge workers in different organisations using the ESM. The central analytical proposal of the article is that the interviewees express a “digital resignation” towards the implementation of the ESM. In contrast to previous discussions, this resignation cannot only be thought of as “corporately cultivated” by third parties, but must also be considered as “organisationally cultivated” by the organisations people work for. The study suggests that datafication-oriented media studies should consider organisational contexts.</p>

<p>The term ‘AI’ is not a new term but the actual meaning of ai is still hidden. Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines which are as intelligent as human beings. AI mainly focus on some questions like knowledge required while thinking, the way knowledge can be presented and the way knowledge can be used in other field’s viz.&nbsp;Robotics. Scope of AI is much wider than our thinking. It is not limited to only one or two areas rather in coming future everything will be directly or indirectly linked to AI. Much research has been done on artificial intelligence which has shown that by the end of 2020 many works which was not possible by human beings will be efficiently and accurately can be carried out by the help of robots. Robotics is a branch of engineering that deals with formation, designing, manufacturing, operation of robots. Artificial intelligence is being applied to many areas which are capable to solve many problems like in robotics, e-commerce, domestic chores, medical treatment, gaming, mathematics, military planning etc. The main idea behind the merging of artificial intelligence and robotics is to optimize the level of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> through learning. In the coming future we can surely overcome the disadvantages of robots like misuse of it with the help of facial recognition. Or we can use AI in other fields like in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> security to prevent the systems from being hacked. The applications of AI and how we can implement other applications in coming time are discussed adding to it how we can overcome the disadvantages of using robots in regular life are also discussed.</p>

<p>• An automated micro-investment service at a retail bank was modified during an RCT. • A weekly option to multiply automatic micro-investments increased them by 20-36%. • An option to make a freely chosen investment generated substantial contributions. • Treatment was similarly effective across most demographic and personality variables. Automated financial services remedy present biased financial behaviour by nudging users towards investing. Although these services increase investments, they deprive users of the experience of making prudent decisions that would satisfy their need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Assuming that freedom of choice facilitates <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, we hypothesized that the addition of an element of choice to an automated micro-investment service would increase the amounts invested. To test this idea, we randomised 825 volunteer users of a micro-investments service at an Estonian bank to receive different versions of weekly <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s offering a choice to double, quadruple, or keep the money they had accrued for investment through the service. We found that the treatment increased the average investment per participant by 20 to 36%. The effectiveness of the treatments was independent of a number of financial, socio-economic, or personality characteristics other than income. We conclude that the addition of elements of choice to automated investment services has a significant potential to increase investments and improve financial well-being.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 has put higher education institutions in a new situation and identified bottlenecks in the financial structure of institutions and education systems in general. However, for Ukrainian universities, this situation can be seen as an opportunity to achieve financial <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. This study is devoted to the consideration of a possible tool for the financial <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of Ukrainian classical universities, most of which are state-funded. The paper considers the methodology of a possible tool for the accumulation of external financing – the endowment fund. The case analysis and analytical consideration of world practice are applied. As a result, a model for financing the university in its transition to the innovation and entrepreneurship model is proposed as the chain “endowment fund – development of start-ups”. This example can become the basis of the road map for other national HEIs, as well as the practice of wider use in the field of higher education. However, despite most of the national classical universities have declared a course to an innovative development, which further raised the necessity of external funding, top management and general economic situation require more attention. As this transition to a new model of the university is taking place along with the financial stabilization and under economic and social upheavals, the formation of a new culture of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communication</span> is necessary. Thus, the proposed model is the practical guideline of possible decisions but mostly the start-point for further discussion and research. AcknowledgmentThis paper is done in the framework of the grant project “Financial stabilization of classical universities in the context of the global consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic” funded by the National Research Foundation of Ukraine “Science for Human Security and Society” (2020-2021).</p>

<p>“Digital sovereignty” is the idea that states should “reaffirm” their authority over the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and protect their citizens, institutions, and businesses from the multiple challenges to their nation’s self-determination in the digital sphere. According to this principle, sovereignty depends on more than supranational alliances or international legal instruments, military might or trade: it depends on locally-owned, controlled and operated innovation ecosystems, able to increase states’ technical and economic independence and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Presently, digital sovereignty is understood primarily as a legal concept and a set of political discourses. As a consequence, it is predominantly analysed by political science, international relations and international law. However, the study of digital sovereignty as a set of infrastructures and socio-material practices has been largely neglected. In this proposal, I argue that the concept of (digital) sovereignty should also be studied via the infrastructure-embedded “situated practices” of various political and economic projects which aim to establish autonomous digital infrastructures in a hyperconnected world. Although this contribution is also a call for a wider and comparative research programme, I will focus here on the “pilot case” of Russia, which is the subject of an ongoing research project. Ultimately, the analysis of infrastructure-embedded digital sovereignty practices in Russia shows how the Russian discourse on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> sovereignty as a centralized and top-down apparatus paradoxically open up technical and legal opportunities for mundane resistances and the existence of “parallel” Runets, where particular instantiations of informational freedom are still possible.</p>

<p>Smart technologies promise a future in which the care needed by vulnerable people can be delivered at a distance, informed by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things-enabled remote sensing and by artificial intelligence used to identify problematic patterns in physiological readings and behavioural data. In this context, surveillance is widely portrayed as a means to maintain the independence of those being monitored. This paper examines the promise of smart care through analysis of documentation from policy, from research and development settings and from marketing materials aimed at carers, people living with dementia and social care agencies in the UK. For informal carers, the monitoring carried out by smart care systems is predominantly framed as reassurance for the carer, while for the person living with dementia a reassurance is offered that there will be help at times of need. For healthcare professionals, lack of knowledge is positioned as a limiting factor on providing optimal care and hence the monitoring offered by smart care becomes an ethical responsibility in the search for improved care as well as a means to increased efficiency. While smart care aims to promote independence, this form of surveillance and the AI-generated predictions that are built upon it can offer imperatives to action that may act against <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. To evaluate ethical implications more fully we need to move beyond the promotional discourse to find out more about how people live with such systems and how these systems become a part of the relations of expertise and responsibility that pervade care.</p>

<p>In the 21st century, an era dominated by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and ever-expanding digitalization, it is difficult to hide electronic-footprints and information about ourselves from the world. In this regard, the emergence of a ‘new’ right to be forgotten (RTBF) in the EU, which protects the ‘personal data’ of individuals, has received critical acclaim. While tracing the origins, nature and scope of the RTBF in EU, this article shall attempt to best jurisprudentially locate RTBF as both an ‘independent right’ and a facet derived from values like ‘privacy’, ‘<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>’ and ‘dignity’. Subsequently, the problem of ‘theoretical indeterminacy’ arising from co-existence of RTBF and right to ‘privacy’ shall be addressed. Moving forward, the practical limitations of RTBF and its ‘balancing’ with competing rights/interests shall be delineated. Finally, a comparative analysis of the RTBF in the supra-national EU with the nascent development of RTBF and right to ‘informational privacy’ in India shall be undertaken.</p>

<p>Based on qualitative and quantitative analyses, activist work and HCI approaches, these papers show how organizations formed partnerships to curate information resources, and deploy community Wi-Fi and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> infrastructure across southwest US Indigenous communities during the most challenging months of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. For Native Americans this means ideating while navigating colonial inequality. Through an investigation of sociotechnical interdependencies across a broadband network cooperative, tribes, and university labs, an HCI team reflects on how relational stability sustains fragile <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> ecologies stretched to capacity by the needs of users deeply affected by COVID-19 in New Mexico and Arizona. Through an autoethnography of community-centered digital solutions for Navajo Nation, a member of the Nation considers how the role of K’é informs a system of infrastructural care in a nation struggling with high rates of infection and systemic lack of adequate infrastructure. Through an advocacy-oriented analysis of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> content, a Diné and Lakota <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> scholar discerns the relationship between community enforcement of social distancing, the loss of interpersonal interaction, mutual aid, and the impact of public health memes for the Navajo Nation. Through radical librarianship practices, a Tohono O’odham librarian and artist counteracts the values of ‘information neutrality’ shaping whiteness-centering American librarianship by generating a community-curated solution to actionable information about COVID-19 for Indigenous communities. This panel models decolonial liberation rooted in responsiveness across mediated layers of Indigenous belonging. The authors express Indigenous interpretations of collective <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> vis-a-vis strategic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> assemblages, and particularly, how an Indigenous ethics of care intersects with the dream of an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> for social good.

<p>The article provides an overview of the Croatian media landscape and its transformation that has been driven by the processes of democratization, commercialization and digitalization.The main media-related concerns from 1990 to 2000 were freedom of the press, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of journalism and censorship. The liberalization of the media market that started in 2000, led to proliferation of media outlets and galloping commercialization of media ownership and content. The next big change came with digitalization that fundamentally altered media habits of Croatian audiences. Television was preceded by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online media</span> as the main source of news while the press registers constant decline in readership, trust and advertising revenues. Radio remains the most trusted medium, as opposed to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> that are the least trusted source of information. Nevertheless, the level of trust in social networks in Croatia is considerably higher than the EU average.The data on media freedom and journalistic <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> indicate that Croatia has made significant progress in this respect in the past thirty years. Although problems related to freedom, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and political pressure persist, the biggest threat to journalism nowadays seems to come from within the profession. Commercialization, coupled with digitalization and merciless struggle for survival, eventually led news media to succumb to tabloid-style journalism and to radically downplay their professional standards. Although the role of the media as a social corrective remains undisputed, such media practices seem to cultivate ‘media fatigue’ and foster distrust in political institutions. In such an ethically challenging environment, the newsrooms and professional organizations remain for the most part silent about eroding professional standards.</p>

<p>This paper aims to examine brand-generated communities from the community managers’ point of view and investigate how <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> influences managerial perceptions, attitudes and practises around brand communities.,The literature review examines the most prominent constructs describing consumer groupings around brands. It then focuses on how the term “brand community” has evolved throughout the years and transformed in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> environment. Research involving one survey and one focus group among agency-employed brand community managers was conducted to explore and interpret their views and their work.,Brand community managers aim to increase platform metrics. They encourage interaction between each user and the brand, but not between users. While they execute pre-planned content calendars handling comments, they do not have the experience and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to foster a communal environment. Finally, managers rely on extrinsic incentives, and even antagonise users, regarding control over the community.,The sample covers the majority of agency-employed brand community managers in one country: Greece. The findings call for a re-examination of the construct of brand community, as well as for a new assessment of groupings consumers form around brands in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>.,For actual brand communities to emerge in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, community managers should have more training, experience and initiative to tailor content and metrics, use intrinsic incentives and propose engaging activities. The quest for platform-imposed measurements inhibits this opportunity, and so do centralised processes that define global brand management.,The managerial aspect of brand-generated communities is understudied, especially when management is outsourced. This paper provides insight on how platform priorities and managerial practises dilute expectations that consumer-generated communities have created.</p>

<p>Rivendell, a free and open source software suite for automated radio broadcasting, has brought several groups with clashing stances on technology, communication, and cultural politics into cooperation. This paper treats Rivendell as an opening onto the politics at play when the liberal ethos propelling free and open source software (Coleman, 2013) meets the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-prizing traditions of independent broadcasting within an automation system. Complicating this already tense juncture, Rivendell has drawn users and code contributors from drastically opposed political groups within American broadcastings—right-wing Christian talk radio networks and progressive community stations—and has sustained a difficult terrain of working compromise that the activist push for low-power FM broadcasting inaugurated (Dunbar-Hester, 2014). In this paper, analysis of Rivendell’s open source code base sheds light on its development and helps connect it to longer histories of media automation and its attendant social frictions. Interviews with lead Rivendell developers complete the picture of the project’s trajectory, of its relation to the religious right context where the project began, and of the negotiations that have played out among its developers and its community of users in terrestrial and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> radio. The ongoing compromises and tensions threaded through Rivendell can offer insight into an issue that becomes larger and more pressing as media become increasingly complex and networked: how artists, activists, and media technologists who prioritize independence have reckoned with their reliance on socio-technical infrastructures whose connections may strike them as far less than savory.</p>

<p>We develop a formal framework for automatic reasoning about the obligations of autonomous <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-physical systems, including their social and ethical obligations. Obligations, permissions and prohibitions are distinct from a system’s mission, and are a necessary part of specifying advanced, adaptive AI-equipped systems. They need a dedicated deontic logic of obligations to formalize them. Most existing deontic logics lack corresponding algorithms and system models that permit automatic verification. We demonstrate how a particular deontic logic, Dominance Act Utilitarianism (DAU), is a suitable starting point for formalizing the obligations of autonomous systems like self-driving cars. We demonstrate its usefulness by formalizing a subset of Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) in DAU; RSS is an industrial proposal for how self-driving cars should and should not behave in traffic. We show that certain logical consequences of RSS are undesirable, indicating a need to further refine the proposal. We also demonstrate how obligations can change over time, which is necessary for long-term <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. We then demonstrate a model-checking algorithm for DAU formulas on weighted transition systems, and illustrate it by model-checking obligations of a self-driving car controller from the literature.</p>

<p>Learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is the ability and responsibility of learners to take control of their learning. Motivation, the chance to work independently and/ or collaboratively, access to the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and library, and challenging tasks promote learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. This study explores English language teachers’ perceptions and practices on learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and finds the difference in the perceptions and practices by their sex, level, qualification, and type of school they teach. One hundred thirty-three (133) teachers teaching at Tulsipur Sub-metropolitan Dang, Nepal, were selected using the fishbowl technique. Data drawn with the questionnaire’s help were analysed via univariate (frequency, percentage, and median) and bivariate (t-test and Cohen’s d) analysis. From the analyses, it was found that English language teachers teaching at different levels are aware of the what, why, and how of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and they promote learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> by engaging and encouraging students to be involved in the tasks which promote learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Perceptions on learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> do not differ by their sex, level, qualification, and type of school they teach. Likewise, practices on learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> also do not differ by the sex and level of the teachers, but their practices differ by the type of school where they teach and their qualification.</p>

<p>Purpose The authors develop a conceptual model to examine how three basic psychological needs (i.e.&nbsp;needs for competence, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and relatedness) affect employee <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use (i.e.&nbsp;work- and social-related use). The authors propose that the need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> positively moderates the relationship between need for competence and work-related use, whereas it negatively moderates that between need for relatedness and social-related use. Design/methodology/approach To test the proposed model, 332 internal and 271 external <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> users in the workplace were recruited. Findings The results indicate that needs for competence and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and needs for relatedness and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> positively affect the work- and social-related use, respectively, of internal and external <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. Need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> positively moderates the relationship between need for competence and work-related use of internal <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, and it negatively moderates that between need for relatedness and the social-related use of internal <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. Need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> has no moderating effect on the relationship between need for competence and work-related use, whereas it negatively moderates the relationship between need for relatedness and the social-related use of external <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. Originality/value First, the authors’ findings offer significant empirical support for the different <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> uses, namely work and social related. Second, this study highlights the importance of psychological needs of employees in determining the form of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use. Third, this study empirically demonstrates the differences in psychological needs and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use between two different <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> contexts.</p>

<p>Several European Commission’s initiatives have been resorting to ethics in policy discourses as a way to govern and regulate <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies (ICT). The proliferation of invocations of ‘ethics’, especially concerning the recent debate on (the regulation of) Artificial Intelligence (AI), can be referred to as the ‘ethification’ phenomenon. This article aims to elucidate the benefits and drawbacks of the ethification of ICT governance, and its effects on the articulations of law, technology and politics in democratic constitutional states. First, the article will provide a mapping to locate where the ethics work is being produced in the EU. Second, the authors will distinguish different types of ethics based on the mapping. Third, the ethification phenomenon will be analyzed through the concepts of boundary and convergence work, where we will both see that it plays the role of ‘normative glue’ between interests of different practices to reach a common goal, but also tracing or obfuscating boundaries to claim <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> from the law and exclude forms of non-genuine ethics. Fourth, we inquire into the nature of ethics as a practice and the consequences of ethification for the law.</p>

<p>This paper explores the changing socio-cultural dynamic between local music entrepreneurs and journalists/critics on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> in Estonia. Through the analysis of 32 semi-structured interviews with music industry professionals and experts and observations of their activities on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>, the study identifies the decreasing distance between music criticism and music promotion. On the one hand, the music critics once envisioned as ‘autonomous gatekeepers’ (Hirsch, 1972) find it increasingly hard to transfer their musical authority, expertise and perceived independence to the commercially driven <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> environment. As a result, some of them have taken up entrepreneurship themselves, converged their various identities by mixing their critical/evaluative practices as critics and business-oriented practices as entrepreneurs. On the other hand, some niche music entrepreneurs are stepping into the role of cultural authorities by mobilizing and catering to specific taste cultures and genre communities by becoming expert gatekeepers in their own right, despite being compromised by their business interest. In this context, it is no more useful to talk about the ‘mutual dependency’ of the music press and industry PR (Forde, 2001; Negus, 1992). Rather, among the tightly interwoven music scenes like the ones in Estonia, where many players adopt a variety of different and often conflicting roles (especially on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>), we should recognize the complete convergence of music promotion and music criticism and the loss of critical distance and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> altogether.</p>

<p>The potential offered by the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, combined with the enormous number of connectable devices, offers benefits in many areas of our modern societies, both public and private. The possibility of making heterogeneous devices communicate with each other through the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> has given rise to a constantly growing scenario, which was unthinkable not long ago. This unstoppable growth takes place thanks to the continuous availability of increasingly sophisticated device features, an ever-increasing bandwidth and reliability of the connections, and the ever-lower consumption of the devices, which grants them long <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. This scenario of exponential growth also involves other sectors such as, for example, that of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which offers us increasingly sophisticated approaches that can be synergistically combined with wireless devices and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> in order to create powerful applications for everyday life. Precisely for the aforementioned reasons, the community of researchers, year by year, dedicates more time and resources in this direction. It should be observed that this happens in an atypical way concerning the other research fields, and this is because the achieved progress and the developed applications have practical applications in numerous and different domains.</p>

<p>Biohacking refers to optimizing one’s body through modifying biology. In the 20th century, do-it-yourself (DIY) biology emerged as a type of biohacking involving biotechnology. Current high- healthcare costs promote DIY -biology insulin and EpiPens as ways to challenge norms in healthcare, thus serving as forms of activism. Biohacked insulin is part of the #WeAreNotWaiting movement to support improved treatment of Type 1 diabetes, whereas biohacked EpiPens allow people to make lifesaving autoinjectors at low costs. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social media</span> acts as a catalyst and aids in the spread of insulin and EpiPen biohacking as activism. In 1979, Principles of Biomedical Ethics by Beauchamp and Childress proposed four principles that continue to guide decision-making in clinical medicine: beneficence, nonmaleficence, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and justice. This paper applies these principles to explore whether the benefits of performing DIY biology outweigh the potential health risks. Examining biohacking with a biomedical ethics frame, as outlined by Beauchamp and Childress, reveals that biohacking acts as a response to current issues but cannot serve as a solution in its current form. However, biohacking can grant patients more power in their relationship with the healthcare system, therefore lessening the dominance of formal institutions. Out of the four principles, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> applies most differently when regarding biohacking than traditional medicine. Accordingly, a model of ethics for biohacking, such as of Beauchamp and Childress’ with the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> altered to acknowledge the additional implications of biohacking, should be developed in the future.</p>

<p>“Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly being developed and various applications are already used in medical practice. This development promises improvements in prediction, diagnostics and treatment decisions. As one example, in the field of psychiatry, AI systems can already successfully detect markers of mental disorders such as depression. By using data from <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> (e.g.&nbsp;<span style="background-color:lightgreen">Instagram</span> or <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span>), users who are at risk of mental disorders can be identified. This potential of AI-based depression detectors (AIDD) opens chances, such as quick and inexpensive diagnoses, but also leads to ethical challenges especially regarding users’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The focus of the presentation is on <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-related ethical implications of AI systems using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> data to identify users with a high risk of suffering from depression. First, technical examples and potential usage scenarios of AIDD are introduced. Second, it is demonstrated that the traditional concept of patient <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> according to Beauchamp and Childress does not fully account for the ethical implications associated with AIDD. Third, an extended concept of “Health-Related Digital <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span>” (HRDA) is presented. Conceptual aspects and normative criteria of HRDA are discussed. As a result, HRDA covers the elusive area between <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> users and patients. ”</p>

<p>Applications using Artificial Intelligence (AI) have become commonplace and embedded in our daily lives. Much of our communication has transitioned from human-human interaction to human-technology or technology-mediated interaction. As technology is handed over control and streamlines choices and decision-making in different contexts, people are increasingly concerned about a potential threat to their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. In this paper, we explore <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> perception when interacting with AI-based applications in everyday contexts using a design fiction-based survey with 328 participants. We probed if providing users with explanations on “why” an application made certain choices or decisions influenced their perception of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> or reactance regarding the interaction with the applications. We also looked at changes in perception when users are aware of AI’s presence in an application. In the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> context, we found that people perceived a greater reactance and lower sense of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> perhaps owing to the personal and identity-sensitive nature of the application context. Providing explanations on “why” in the navigation context, contributed to enhancing their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> perception, and reducing reactance since it influenced the users’ subsequent actions based on the recommendation. We discuss our findings and the implications it has for the future development of everyday AI applications that respect human <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.</p>

<p>The aim of this study is to understand the changes within families during confinement motivated by the COVID-19 pandemic and to explore the psycho-emotional experiences of children and their parents in this new situation. Confinement necessarily induced significant changes in daily family routines, particularly for work, education, leisure and social activities. In the more vulnerable pediatric population, several authors have warned of the need to consider the impact of lockdown measures during COVID-19 on the psychological impact and well-being.This is an anonymous online survey with methodology combining quantitative and qualitative analyses. The questions targeted several themes such as life context, emotional experience and the impact on daily habits in children and adolescents, as perceived by parents. Participants are adults and parents of at least one child. They were recruited through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>.A total of 439 parents responded to the questionnaire. The families generally stayed in their usual place of residence and managed to adapt well. On average, the children’s level of worry (as estimated by parents) was lower than the level of worry parents attributed to themselves. For the majority, the parents did not observe any change, the psychological state of the children and adolescents was generally stable, but for those who experienced more negative emotions than usual, it was an increase in boredom, irritability and anger. A decrease in the quality of sleep was also observed by a third of the respondents. On the other hand, an increase in <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> was noted. Regarding the quality of family cohabitation, an important result showed that confinement had improved family relationships for 41% parents but at the expense of usual social ties inducing a feeling of deprivation. Indeed, the participants evoke a lack of “social link” and “social contact with friends”. Lack became synonymous with absence, a feeling of loneliness and separation.Our results confirm European and international data collected in children in countries where strict lockdown measures have been applied. Despite the negative emotions felt in some children, confinement has helped develop new resources in most families. Families seem to have been successful in maintaining a stable and secure routine which has certainly been a protective factor against anxiety. Some reported factors, such as bonding, could be protective factors and constitute good leads in interventions to be offered to children and their families.</p>

<p>Indigenous voices and outlooks are often overlooked within public discourses in Australia and throughout the world. Settler-colonialism has resulted in centuries of dispossession, manifesting in the denial of Indigenous citizenship, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and sovereignty. Throughout this article we discuss how Indigenous people are increasingly turning to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> to illuminate how colonialism continues to oppress Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and communities. In doing so, Indigenous people are disrupting what we call the ‘colonial algorithms’ that shape misguided perceptions of Indigenous people and identities. Analysing Indigenous use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and centring our discussion around several Indigenous-led online campaigns, we demonstrate how online platforms are bringing an array of social issues to light in ways that privilege Indigenous voices and perspectives, ultimately disrupting and shifting oppressive colonial algorithms.</p>

<p>The fast and global way which has characterized the presence of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s in society has sparked the interest of several sectors of activity, including journalism. From the early stages of production to distribution, and then through the characteristics of content and consumption patterns, numerous changes have been introduced by these mobile devices in an activity that has been undergoing one of the most uncertain moments in its long history. This uncertainty has stemmed from the decrease in income which was caused by the emergence of new competitors, such as the online press and social networks. This bibliographic review aims at identifying the changes caused by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s in the production distribution and consumption of news, analyzing its effect on the epistemology of journalism. We attempt to ascertain if the increasing influence of mobile technologies in the journalistic activity has changed its nature, improving the production of knowledge. Upon closer reading of the bibliography, it can be concluded that the versatility of mobile devices has facilitated a set of new possibilities not only for journalists, namely more <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and a reduction in the time spent between the event and the publication, but also for consumers, who can do a mobile and personalized consumption on their screens. Due to its ability to continuously adapt to the rhythm of contemporary society, mobile journalism has become more universal and has been confirmed as a form of knowledge insofar as it responds more effectively to consumers’ expectations, in particular young people’s, who are moving away from journalism and thus prevent the generational renewal of readers, something which is fundamental for the media business model.</p>

<p>The predominance of English in the media, particularly on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>, have been responsible for driving change in language education policy and there is a global trend towards introducing English language teaching into the system of education.The introduction of web 2.0 network services in language education is one of the promising areas of informatization of the educational process, which helps to foster a stable communication competence in the students and design formative assessment under the guidance of an experienced teacher. Modern digital technologies with the transition to a more communicative approach offer new forms of assessments that were not available to us even ten years ago. Students have the opportunity to record videos while interacting in groups or even working on a monologue or story. Students often practice uploading podcasts and audio files and creating diary and wiki entries.The article deals with the benefits of digital technology during teaching English, which opens new perspectives on the assessment. The research describes the stages of the organization of assessment in the classroom, emphasizes the importance of feedback on testing, examines some factors that affect the teaching of English in terms of its assessment, gives an overview of the benefits of using washback effect and lists the problems associated with the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies. The author explores the potential of using formative and summative assessments as well as the feedback to improve students’ academic achievement and progress. Digital technology and assessment help us to achieve some of our goals: improved motivation, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> or closer cooperation between students, and so on. In addition, feedback can even be provided by students themselves, which contributes to the formation of self-assessment. Consequently, it becomes obvious what should be changed in the course on the basis of the assessment of students’ progress during the learning cycle.There is a lack of professionalism in the use of some <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies, which negatively affects the effectiveness of assessment systems of English.

<p>Individuals with high self-concept will likely have high life satisfaction, they easily get adjusted to life, and they communicate their feeling more appropriately. However, it was not certain whether self-concept would decline or improve as individuals age, or whether self-concept would vary between genders and ethnic groups. To prove, a study was carried out to compare the self-concept of college students in an Asian context. The inquiry utilized the cross-sectional design in finding out significant differences in the self-concept of participants in terms of age, gender, and ethnicity. A 22-item questionnaire was adapted and administered to 222 Bachelor of Public Administration and Bachelor of Science in Business Administration students from the satellite campus of Bukidnon State University in the Philippines. Initially, a sample was randomly drawn from the population. During the actual data collection, the researchers had difficulty getting the responses from the randomly selected individuals due to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> connection and it was done amidst a pandemic. Instead, it took all responses from those who were available, have access to the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>, and could accomplish the google forms. The data were analyzed using Mean, Standard Deviation, T-test for independent sample, ANOVA and Post Hoc test. The results revealed that college students at the locale have a high level of self-concept in self-fulfilment, emotional adjustment, and honesty. Yet, they only had a moderate level of self-concept in <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Further, there were significant differences in college students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and honesty in terms of age and gender. Furthermore, there were significant differences in their emotional adjustment and self-fulfilment as to their ethnicity. The results have implications for instruction, administration, guidance services, and future research.</p>

<p>Last few years HR professionals, organizations, employers and other stake holders are taking initiatives to create work-life balance. But as the approach says to keep work and family domains separate, modern work culture and work demands goes in reverse direction. The remaining credit to overlapping of work and non-work activities goes to technology and gadgets like <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>, tablet, laptop etc. It is obvious that it is not possible to keep these domains isolated to each other and with the limited time and energy obligations of both sides cannot be fulfilled by keeping them separate. It is better to integrate both work and non-work activities so that one can manage his or her time and energy to do all activities in same time. To integrate the different domains, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is required for individuals to choose time, location and quantity of work. Selecting a write flexible work arrangement, will integrate work and life and give a balance between them.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> involves making independent decisions and creating lasting and equitable power relationships within families. Many factors, dependent on both the woman and her partner, can influence self-dependence, and subsequent decision-making, exerting a protective or triggering effect on its development. Therefore, the primary objective of the study was to assess <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in a sample of Lebanese women. The secondary objective was to evaluate the association between socioeconomic status, psychological factors, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.A web based cross-sectional online study was conducted between June 8 and August 1, 2020. The questionnaire developed on Google Forms was distributed through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and WhatsApp groups, using the snowball technique. The Women’s <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> Index (WAI) was created using three items adapted from a previous study. In addition, the Composite Abuse Scale Revised-Short Form (CASR-SF) was used to assess three domains of abuse: physical, sexual, and psychological. The Perceived stress scale short version to measure stress perception, the Lebanese Anxiety Scale to measure anxiety and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to assess depression. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 25 was used for data analysis. Linear regressions were performed, taking the Women’s <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> Index as the dependent variable.The sample consisted of 369 Lebanese women. University education level (beta = 1.263), alcohol consumption (beta = 0.586), intermediate income level (beta = 0.702), high income (beta = 0.911), employment (beta = 0.559), and older age (beta = 0.033) were significantly associated with higher WAI. Living in South Lebanon (beta = - 0.668) and being Druze (beta = - 323) were associated with lower WAI. Significantly higher mean scores of anxiety and perceived stress were found among women with low <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.In Lebanon, the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of women depends on several personal and partner-related characteristics (education, socioeconomic status, age), in addition to the cultural (geographic and religious) environment. Furthermore, low <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is associated with higher perceived stress and anxiety and probable depression and domestic abuse.</p>

<p>This study aimed to investigate the perception of on-site students of the Accounting Sciences Program of a public university that adopted emergency remote learning during the Covid-19 pandemic in Brazil, highlighting the aspects that favor or hinder learning. A qualitative and descriptive study was carried out, with data collected through 4 focus groups with the participation of 80 students from an on-site undergraduate program in Accounting Sciences. The results indicate that the students perceive the structural factors (flexibility in the deadlines for delivery of activities), personal and collective factors (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the learning process) and didactic-pedagogical factors (use of active methodologies by the professor) as facilitating aspects of the remote education. As for the aspects that hinder learning, we highlight external factors (lack of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> access), individual factors (not maintaining a study routine and increased stress levels) and traditional remote education (monotonous videoconference classes). Finally, an optimistic vision for future trends is observed, with changes in the human aspects (change of paradigm of the student’s role), institutional aspects (greater use of technology) and formative aspects (use of active methodologies). It is concluded that the use of active methodologies in the didactic and pedagogical aspect raises the participation of the number of students in remote classes and improves the quality of learning. This study can contribute to educational institutions that adopt emergency remote education for continuity of academic activities in periods of crisis, as well as to professors who plan their activities. It emphasizes the role of the professor and the importance of active methodologies in the development of knowledge.</p>

<p>Mobile learning (mLearning) has gained popularity in recent years, particularly in the clinical setting. mLearning reduces the theory-practice gap by providing relevant information to nurses and boosting clinical skills. Despite the vast majority of work in this area, few studies in nursing have investigated the correlation between motivation and mLearning for continuing practice development (CPD). Motivation is an essential theoretical concept used to explain human motive that is not new in nursing. Understanding the notion of motivation directed towards learning may clarify the role of technology within pedagogy. Additionally, associating motivation and self-determination may be crucial in understanding motivation in professional nursing practice and education. This study determines the effect of mLearning on motivation to enhance CPD in nursing professionals (NP) analysed critically through a Self-Determination Theory lens. Twenty-three qualified nurses working within the clinical area participated by using a specific mobile application on their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> to learn nursing related skills. Over three weeks, participants logged in their learning experience, providing an overview of the relationship between motivation and mLearning. The nurses participating in the study found mLearning motivational in the clinical setting and indicated ownership of their learning, suggesting perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Furthermore, the mobile application enhanced nursing practices through gaining competency and fostered team building through interactions with other health professionals in the clinical area, demonstrating relatedness. This work suggests that having ownership of the learning experience fosters motivation through intrinsic and external needs, supporting learning and gaining competency in the clinical area. Also, the need to become competent and share with others further nurtures motivation to learn in the clinical area. Additionally, these findings suggest mLearning features that motivate NP towards clinical development. This study concludes with implications for the scholarship on mLearning for the continual practice development of nurses.</p>

<p>The ethics of the comic is a relatively new interdisciplinary field of knowledge that is gaining new relevance with the development of a variety of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. The purpose of this article is to review the existing research and show by examples how ethics and values are closely related to the specific functions of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, such as distributing parody content and commenting on it. The main focus of our study is a parody which can be defined as communicative behavior in the form of a text, movement, or even a song, imitating the characteristics or behavior of the object being ridiculed. Unlike a literal quotation, a parody reproduces the original in a distorted form for the purpose of mockery. Within this article modern ethical approaches to the evaluation of parody as well as the main functions of parody in the digital environment are considered. Based on the examples of parody videos on TikTok the particular ways of expressing social problems and cultural traumas by using the comic strategies are identified. Furthermore, the issues of algorithmic censorship concerning such videos as well as the problem of the moral <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of users are discussed.</p>

<p>As a media learning platform, the “Learning Power” platform integrates the advantages of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>, big data, and new media. Through the supply of massive explicit and implicit learning resources as well as the construction of the interactive space of “Learning Power,” it fully embodies the education mechanism of moral education. Specifically, it is reflected in the distinctive political position and the education goal mechanism of “moral education,” the education operation mechanism of “explicit and implicit unity,” the learning mechanism of “<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and cooperation integration,” and the feedback incentive mechanism of “gamification.” The organic combination and interactive operation of these four mechanisms form a collaborative education mechanism system of goal orientation, education operation, learning process, and feedback incentive.</p>
