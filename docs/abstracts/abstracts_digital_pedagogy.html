<p>In the present study we investigate the advantages of using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s in an English as a foreign language EFL classroom. We compared two groups of Japanese university students who were either prohibited from using their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s in the classroom, or encouraged to use them for academic purposes, examining whether those using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s in their EFL lessons would show a tendency toward being autonomous. The results indicated that students who were encouraged to use their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s during class were inclined to study more in their free time as well as show signs of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> by taking charge of their learning and consider ways to improve their own study habits and English proficiency. Our conclusion is that language teachers and learners should be encouraged to use <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s in the classroom as a means of fueling the desire to learn.</p>

<p>Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) call for integrating knowledge and practice in learning experiences in K-12 science education. PlantingScience (PS), an ideal curriculum for use as an NGSS model, is a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">computer-mediated</span> collaborative learning environment intertwining scientific inquiry, classroom instruction, and online mentoring from scientists. With implementation in hundreds of classrooms across the United States, science teachers have noted PS as successful in motivating their students to engage in classroom inquiry investigations. To investigate the role of the online scientist-mentors in motivating students in the PS learning environment, we used self-determination theory (SDT) to guide a multiple case study of 10 student inquiry teams engaged in PS in a rural public school in a large Southwestern U.S. state. We used online dialogues between scientist-mentors and their assigned student inquiry teams to answer research questions about the motivational support provided by scientist-mentors and the association between this support and students’ engagement in scientific inquiry. Analyses revealed a general relationship between scientist-mentor motivational support and student inquiry engagement. Differences were observed in the specific ways in which scientists supported <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness. Student inquiry engagement corresponded to high support in relatedness, whereas correspondence with <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support was low.</p>

<p>The article discusses how the digital exclusion can harm users of the National Industrial Apprenticeship Service (SENAI/MG) of the city of Matozinhos library on your development process in information literacy. In order to discover, identify interests and know the habits of its users, the library of SENAI/MG Matozinhos, in partnership with the library of SENAI/ MG Pedro Leopoldo developed and applied a questionnaire to all students in order to improve the products and services offered. Among the various issues had applied some related knowledge about the information technology area, which were essential to establish the relationship between the digital exclusion and information literacy. Through the analysis of the results identified that the asker has doubts, difficulties and lack sufficient for the use of computer software and found it basic knowledge. These factors inhibit its initiative to uncover the workings of this tool and keep you from having enough time to conduct research on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, develop their homework and know the appropriate information sources <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.</p>

<p>The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> has the potential to provide language learners with vast resources of authentic written, audio, and video materials to supplement lessons. Educators can find a wide assortment of materials for learners to study in class or after class for independent learning and to encourage learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. More recently, however, the immense popularity of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking website</span>s has created new opportunities for language learners to interact in authentic ways that were previously difficult to achieve. Advances in technology mean that today, learners of a language can easily interact with their peers in meaningful practice that helps foster language acquisition and motivation. That is, tasks that make use of Web 2.0 interactivity can significantly raise students’ potential to generate meaningful output and stimulate their interest in language learning.</p>

<p>The paper describes how telecollaboration is implemented at the University of Salento (Italy) and how the experience of peer language exchange with foreign partners via VOIP (Voice Over <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> Protocol) technology has become the nucleus for developing a socially situated learning scenario, designed to promote basically oral interactional skills and learning in <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The instructional program is based on different forms of web 2.0 technology mediated interactions with foreigner partners and on workshops during which students are asked to analyse their video-recorded interactions, completing usage based tasks. The learning scenario is a part of the language teaching curriculum of foreign language university degree courses for which credits are awarded.</p>

<p>This article examines the relevance of modern technology for the development of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the process of learning English as a foreign language. Computer-assisted language learning and computer mediated communication (CMC) appear to be particularly conducive to fostering autonomous learning, as they naturally incorporate many elements of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> that give learners control over and responsibility for their own learning, such as choosing the materials used, managing their contact with various genres and types of interaction, often in authentic contexts, and evaluating their own progress, measured through their success in understanding and conveying meanings. However, providing access to language resources does not automatically lead to the development of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, as much depends on other factors, such as the learners’ level or previous experience in learner training. The present study investigated whether advanced learners of English made use of out-of-class CMC engagement for the purpose of learning English autonomously. The results indicate that most of the participants were eager to use CMC opportunities to deliberately practice their English, although, quite naturally, leisure and social reasons for using CMC predominated. The expressed willingness to deliberately focus on practicing English during beyond-theclassroom meaning-oriented online interactions confirms the great potential of CMC as an <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> enhancement tool.</p>

<p>This case study explains varied perspectives on a difficult dialogue. It provides recommendations for student affairs professionals and faculty members who work with students and teach courses in content areas that are related to diversity, social justice, and privilege. Educators who prepare multiculturally competent students use a variety of methods to accomplish this task. Regardless of the method, however, achieving multicultural competence inevitably involves difficult dialogues regarding race, religion, and sexual orientation. This article presents an actual case describing what happened when a difficult dialogue about race took place in a classroom setting. Student development theory including Helm’s (1990) White Identity Development model, Perry’s (1970) Scheme and Watt’s (2007) Privileged Identity Exploration (PIE) model are used to provide a theoretical framework in case analysis to discuss the involved parties’ behavior. Helms (1990) contends that Whites are innately benefactors of racism. Thus, she proposed a White racial identity development model designed to assist Whites in the process of adopting a nonracist White identity; for this to happen, Whites must abandon personal racism as well as recognize and actively renounce institutional and cultural racism. Phase I of the model Abandonment of Racism has three statuses: (1) Contact, (2) Disintegration and (3) Reintegration. Phase II - Defining a Nonracist White Identity also has three statuses: (1) Pseudo-Independence (2) Immersion-Emersion and (3) <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> (see Helms, 1990). Perry’s (1970) Scheme of Cognitive and Ethical Development consists of nine positions which students move through with respect to intellectual and moral development. These stages are characterized in terms of the student’s attitude towards knowledge and are grouped into four categories: Dualism, Multiplicity, Relativism and Commitment (see Perry, 1970). Watt’s Privileged Identity Exploration (PIE) Model consists of eight defensive reactions, motivated by fear and entidement, when one encounters difficult dialogue. These defensive reactions are grouped under three categories: Category I -Recognizing Privilege Identity has three defense modes (1) denial, (2) deflection, and (3) rationalisation. Category II Contemplating privileged Identity consists of (1) intellectualisation, (2) principium and (3) false envy. Category III-Addressing Privileged Identity includes (1) Benevolence and (2) Minimisation (Watt, 2007). Collectively, these theories focus on cognitive and affective as well as behavioral changes in college students (and others), and encourage student affairs practitioners and faculty members to explore creative and collaborative methods for reducing oppressive actions in the classroom and on campus. Below the case will be presented and then analyzed using the aforementioned developmental theories. The article will conclude with practical applications for student affairs professionals and faculty members. The Case (The names in the following case are pseudonyms) Dominique Stephens is an African American associate professor who has taught diversity related graduate courses in a predominately White institution for nearly a decade. She is keenly aware of how racism shapes students’, particularly White students’, reactions and responses to her as a teacher and to her as an expert on how race informs college student affairs practice. Yet, she was surprised and frustrated by the events she endured one semester while teaching the Diversity in Education course. After attending a few classes, a White male student, Kent Peterson, contacted Professor Stephens via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>, indicating his discomfort with her course and the comments she and his fellow students made about race and racism. She invited Mr.&nbsp;Peterson to meet with her to discuss his concerns. Instead, Mr.&nbsp;Peterson sent another <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>, which he copied to her department chair, stating that the classroom environment was hostile to White males and that he was uncertain about returning to class. …</p>

<p>Access to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social network site</span>s (SNS) in the workplace has been much debated. While some consider SNS a distraction, others consider them a tool for professional socialisation and that recreational access positively impacts satisfaction. This exploratory study reports results from an online survey of employees from one faculty of an Australian university, exploring how they used <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> at work and how they would react to a hypothetical <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> ban. Three-quarters of respondents used <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> at work, primarily for personal socialisation during breaks. Many self-imposed a strict personal/professional separation, but opposed a hypothetical SNS ban, perceiving it as an infringement on their workplace <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. It is argued that university employees - academic and professional - can be trusted to self-regulate access.</p>

<p>I. Introduction Faculty members have been described as purveyors of culture, engines of economic development, and generators of scientific, medical, and technological discoveries that transform human society (Schuster &amp; Finkelstein, 2006). They have been characterized as institutional agents who can foster the development of social and cultural capital, particularly within and among historically disadvantaged communities (Stanton-Salazar, 1997). Faculty have been at the forefront of social change movements, and have been viewed as teachers and mentors who can empower students to achieve their highest potential (Kingston-Mann &amp; Sieber, 2001). But faculty have also been described, by critics, as scam artists who focus on self-interested agendas at the expense of the education of tuition-paying students (Sykes, 1988). Collectively, faculties and their academic disciplines have been defined by some postmodernists as closed communities that endorse only certain forms of knowledge generation, primarily those forms that reinforce the power positions of well-established interests within those disciplines (Foucault, 1986). Recently, faculty have been characterized as managed professionals, whose <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> has been eroded by extensive accountability-oriented measurement systems (Rhoades, 1998) and by a rising managerialism among college and university administrators, who now are more likely to make major decisions without faculty input (Bess, 2006). These various images and metaphors suggest that expectations for the academic profession have become highly differentiated and fragmented. No longer does a quick reference to teaching, research, and service suffice to explain the work of the faculty member. Faculty roles have become increasingly complex and challenging, both for individuals to carry out and for institutions to support. Despite the multitude of images and descriptors associated with academic work, one commonality is that faculty members are people who have human needs for growth, achievement, satisfaction, and connection with others (Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000). Faculty development programs can play an important role on college and university campuses by acknowledging the human needs of faculty members, and by providing the resources, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networks, and innovative ideas that can foster the fulfillment of those needs. This paper reports on an innovative faculty development program that focused its energies on the idea that fulfilling the human needs of faculty members is an essential prerequisite</span> for ongoing growth and success within the academic profession. Many faculty development programs are organized around meeting functional needs, rather than human needs. These programs, many based in centers for teaching and learning, focus on the functional roles that faculty perform, and attempt to identify key areas within those functions that present unique challenges for faculty (e.g., teaching with technology or assessing students’ writing). These functional needs are sometimes identified systematically through a survey of faculty members, but more often the needs are identified by a faculty committee, or by an academic administrator charged with responsibilities for faculty development (Sorcinelli, Austin, Eddy, &amp; Beach, 2006). Once the functional needs have been identified, programs and services are designed to identify and convey a set of skills that can be used to improve performance within a given function (Akerlind, 2005). The programs may be tailored to fit the needs of particular faculty groups, such as junior faculty or discipline-specific issues (e.g., teaching large lecture courses in the sciences). Although these programs may acknowledge different needs by career stage and by academic discipline, they typically are not organized around foundational human needs. The goal of many of these faculty development programs is to teach faculty, for example, how to use technology or how to assess students’ writing, rather than to fulfill faculty members’ needs for growth, achievement, and collegial connection. …</p>

<p>e-Portfolios are a form of authentic assessment with formative functions that include showcasing and sharing learning artifacts, documenting reflective learning processes, connecting learning across various stages and enabling frequent feedback for improvements. This paper examines how e-portfolios take up these formative roles to support productive learning. Qualitative findings from interviews with selected first-year undergraduate students at a higher education institution in Hong Kong are reported concerning students’ experiences of constructing e-portfolios as assessment tasks. As part of an institutional teaching and learning initiative, e-portfolios were incorporated into three core courses for first-year students. The findings reveal that several conditions necessary to foster productive learning were missing in students’ experiences: strengthened formative role of e-portfolios through coherent assessment design; encouragement for students’ pursuit of authentic tasks to develop learning interests; engagement of students in reflective and self-regulative learning as an essential learning process; provision of constructive feedback for sustained learning support; and support for students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> through facilitation of collaborative knowledge building. By explicating how the lack of these conditions impeded students’ active involvement in e-portfolio tasks and suggesting relevant strategies for teachers at the institution in question, this paper offers implications for harnessing <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y ( ICT) to support students’ productive learning.

<p>As LIBRARIANS ADDED AUDIOVISUAL MATERIALS to their collections and then electronic materials, they moved from selection as an individual activity to selection as a group activity. Librarians made every effort to mainstream the resulting selection process and incorporate it into the existing library organization. However, with the advent of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and the ability to simultaneously share virtual resources, cooperative collection development, through consortial arrangements, became popular once again. The ability of consortia to purchase products at a better price than individual libraries can has made them very popular with funding agencies. However, the result is that the role of the selector has been diminished. As the purchase of virtual resources accelerates, particularly through consortial agreements, the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the local library will fade and the roles of librarians will change drastically. This rapid transformation is illustrated by a discussion of OhioLINK and its effects, both positive and negative, on one member library.</p>

<p>Several researchers have emphasized the significant role of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>y (ICT) in advancing the process of teaching and learning at schools. Therefore, a number of countries started to introduce ICT resources in all levels. Similarly, the Kuwaiti Ministry of Education (MoE) has recently mandated that all school staff meet certain standards to ensure that they have the ability to use ICT resources in their schools. However, the literature indicates that the integration of ICT in the classroom does not only rest in the hands of teachers; school principals also play a vital role in determining the success or failure of ICT use in the teaching process. This study sought to document the impact of Kuwaiti secondary school principals on their teachers’ attitude toward ICT embedding in classroom teaching. The multiple case studies approach was employed to access data from three secondary schools in Kuwait. Both open ended questionnaires and focus group interviews with 15 teachers were used to collect the data. The data analysis showed that all participating teachers recognized the impact that their principals’ leadership practices had on ICT embedding. They highlighted the effectiveness of the principals’ stimulation and encouragement of ICT embedding, which resulted in a change to the teaching practices, making them more ICT related. The study revealed that school principals in Kuwait had less <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, authority, and opportunity to adopt unique practices and behaviours in leading their schools. Therefore, the study recommends that the MoE revisit its regulations, specifically, those related to the school principals’ roles and responsibilities.

<p>Higher education teachers are steadily challenged to adopt and use <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICT) during their everyday tasks. Moreover, interplay between teaching and research demands creation and configuration of new learning environments to overcome a technology-focused approach and provide a more significant, enhanced teaching experience. Therefore it is reasonable for them to include collaborative and autonomous components as a learning strategy to simplify the acquisition of knowledge from a hands-on experience based on students’ interests. The methodology used in this work involved a literature review with a focus on analyzing the interpretation of several basic texts, the categorization and analysis of the teaching skills from a constructivist perspective within the ICT framework, allowing for a development of autonomous and collaborative education. Thus, the conclusions of this analysis point to a regular teachers’ training as one of the most important components of an action plan toward the successful implementation of teaching strategies that encourage an active involvement of students under teacher`s guide, whose main role is to stimulate the activation of the students’ metacognitive abilities and attitudes.</p>

<p>The paper presents the findings of a quasi-experimental study which sought to explore the effectiveness of online resources on the development of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and to determine whether increased <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> results in greater pronunciation gains as well as to compare it with the effects of traditional instruction when it comes to individual students. What is more, the study sets out to determine whether the gains in the two areas are maintained over time with respect to individual learners. The subjects were 45 Polish senior high school learners. The targeted structure was the final -ed sound of the simple past tense of regular English verbs. Three groups, two experimental and one control group, participated in the study. The intervention spanned the period of two weeks. The learners in Experimental Group 1 were provided with access to the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and were thus allowed to exercise more freedom in learning English pronunciation. The students in Experimental Group 2 were taught in a traditional way (i.e.&nbsp;controlled by the teacher) and the learners in the control group did not receive any instruction. The data were collected by means of a pronunciation <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> questionnaire, as well as pronunciation tests administered before and after the study was concluded. The results reveal that the majority of individual students in Experimental Group 1 showed more <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and they outperformed their counterparts on the tests, which provides a justification for using digital technology as a tool for promoting <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and teaching pronunciation.</p>

<p>Higher Education is not stranger to the changes produced on contemporary societies by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies, because its dimensions of research and teaching have seen modified some of its essential practices. However, if such dimensions aspire to become renovator and not to injure the ultimate sense of the university, they could not undermine the aim of development of the person as person. In this article, we propose a theoretical reflection that considers several key aspects related to the conditions of fostering virtues on virtual higher education: the appropriate conception of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of university students as members of an academic community, the relationships with peers and professors on virtual learning environments, the specificity of academic content, and the formal and relational criteria that support the aesthetic workmanship of higher education.</p>

<p>This article discusses the possibility to include innovation into basic education and to explore within this education, a compatible methodology known as “independent learning”. An additional requirement to contemporary educational processes is to prepare future professionals and the general public to a world where innovation is of great importance. Therefore, it is crucial the role that new technologies, especially digital technologies including the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, can play on the educational experiences of students and teachers throughout their school lives. The main feature of the independent learning approach is to explore the learner’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and it is of key importance to adopt the student as the center of the learning process and, the stimulus to “learn to learn” as the main reference. Although the general definition includes self-learning stricto sensu, in fact, for most cases, within the regular school, in this methodology the protagonists are the integration with the curriculum and the teacher. Likewise, even though the potential use of this approach is, in general, associated with adults, it is at the young age that the habit of learn to learn better develops, more naturally and relevant. We will also present essential issues associated to the third great educational revolution, symbolized by the digital technologies and the innovation’s central role in the contemporary world, which are deeply affecting two key items of the teaching-learning process: the way we produce new knowledge, and the way we construct it pedagogically. So, we quickly evolve to a scenario where the complex digital competence and the vocation for innovation will match, in level of importance, the traditional knowledge and to the typical skills taught in today’s schools, demanding “independent learning” as the appropriate methodology for elementary and intermediate schools.</p>

<p>To the Editor: I read with interest the excellent report by S<span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>te et al.&nbsp;<a href="#aff-1">1</a> on the reflective writing of medical students during the psychiatry clerkship experience. I strongly agree that narrative reflection can greatly help students process complex and challenging experiences during training, and I think it is particularly useful for us educators to understand and respond to the most important themes that emerge from such reflection. At our institution, we have required students to write a 500word reflective essay at some point during their clerkship, with the general prompt of picking a patient they worked with that stood out for them, writing about what made them stand out. This essay counts for 10 % of their final grade, with student papers assessed for empathy, ability to reflect on meaning, and presentation of broader issues beyond the case. An informal look at the past year of essays shows very similar themes to the ones reported by S<span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>te et al.&nbsp;Out of 159 essays, 18 % emphasized themes of context (that patients do not exist in a vacuum, that family and social forces matter, etc.). Another 17 % addressed the struggle of patients with mental illness, particularly recognizing the severity of illness and functional effects. The third most common theme (16 %) related to challenges in the doctor-patient relationship, particularly countertransference, provider limitations, and resistance. To our surprise, only 5 % of essays addressed issues of patient <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> or paternalism (e.g., coercion, capacity, etc.). We were particularly interested in examining if there were any differences in themes between essays written at the very start of the students’ clerkship year, compared to the writing of students at the very end. Although the combined sample is small (n=38), it does appear that students just starting clerkships were more likely than their veteran peers to write about issues of context and the doctor-patient relationship (50 vs.&nbsp;25 % for both) and less likely to address issues of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, severity, or patient-centered care. When we sit down with students to discuss the clerkship experience, these are the issues we now highlight, both at the outset and during the clerkship, in an effort to help students more productively and safely grow into their professional identity and role. Using reflective writing as a prompt for group discussion can further deepen the value of such writing [2]. Finally, it also seems important that such a process takes place throughout the medical curriculum, not just on psychiatry. Although the psychiatry clerkship certainly raises unique and powerful issues related to patient care, the most common themes raised by students certainly occur in many clinical contexts, and students are likely to benefit from reflection on all clerkships. At our institution, we have successfully encouraged other clerkships to add a writing component to the requirements, and other medical schools do reflective writing throughout the curriculum, which seems to be a particularly useful way to help students with their professional development.</p>

<p>New model of teaching and learning was introduced in our school to meet the needs of our students who seek greater <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, connectivity as well as opportunities for socio-experiential learning. The Connected Learning Pedagogy (CLP) was designed to mine the learning potential of the new social and digital media domain to create a community of ownership of learning, promoting collaboration and connectedness among students, lecturers and parents. To support the implementation of CLP, laboratories were equipped with computers and tablet PCs. Through them, students were connected to various social and digital media such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>, Moodle, YouTube and iDeâ€™Lite (ITE video portal) to conduct their required research and learning. The tablet PCs provided lecturers with the added advantage of mobility during lessons, allowing them to facilitate the learning process with ease. Students were engaged in many exciting ways through Apps in the tablet PCs. In addition, parents were connected to students learning through PRISM (ITE Parentsâ€™ Real-time Information System on Mobile). With the mobile apps, PRISM, parents are connected to realtime data on their childâ€™s learning.</p>

<p>There is currently an increased interest in the effect of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use in the college student population, a group that may be particularly susceptible to problems related to online use because of the accessibility afforded them on campuses and due to their developmental stage of identity formation. The current study examined the relationship between quan- tity of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use and the common concerns of college students. An online student survey of behavior and concerns was administered to 182 college freshmen. The survey included demographic variables, ratings of satisfaction with various campus experiences, and ratings of level of concerns for 78 problems or issues that are often faced by college students. Freshman students who use the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> for less than 10 hours per week were at least twice as likely as those who do not to report concern over feeling sad or depressed, not knowing how to study effectively, feeling lonely, jug- gling too many roles, and not living up to people’s expectations. Results showed that male students who were online more than 10 hours per week expressed significantly less concern about their emerging role definitions and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Female students who used the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> for more than 10 hours per week reported significantly less concern about being sad or depressed. These results support the hypothesis that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use in college freshmen may represent a successful coping mechanism. This finding is discussed in relation to recent research reports on both detriments and benefits of online use by college students.</p>

<p>Digital equity and intercultural education continue to be areas of concern in the emerging knowledge-based society. The digital divide is present across the globe as the result of a complex of factors such as the inequality in: access to hardware and connectivity; <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of use; digital and literacy skills; availability of technical and social support; and access to educators skilled in the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICTs). Although there is rapid progress in the growth of mobile subscriptions across the globe, there remain groups of digitally excluded peoples within and across countries. Moreover, although progress has been made in addressing connectivity issues and challenges in learning about digital technology, teachers and learners continue to face issues and challenges related to teaching-and-learning with digital technologies and resources within local contexts and beyond. For instance, in an era of rapid global cultural, political, economic and social changes, the need for intercultural education has never been greater. Not only does digital exclusion contribute to a knowledge divide but it also limits opportunities for intercultural connections, communications and understandings. Building on the work of previous EDUsummITs, the EDUsumIT 2013 participants focused on exploring how digital equity and intercultural education are intertwined. This paper describes current needs and challenges as well as opportunities related to digital equity and intercultural education, as well as the increasingly important role technology plays in helping to foster intercultural understanding and education. These are illustrated by examples of how access to digital resources may help bridge both the digital and cultural divides and relate them to some of the recommendations for policy and practice made by the EduSummit 2013 Digital Equity and Intercultural Education Workgroup to help address these needs.</p>

<p>Within the integration of technology into language education, special attention needs to be paid to languages for specific purposes (LSP), drawing on developments in computer-assisted language learning and applied linguistics, on the one hand, and on the pervasive use of technology in academic and professional communication, on the other. From a definition of LSP centered on learner need, specificity of activities and materials, and teacher and learner profiles, this article examines how technology has transformed LSP teaching and learning. Through technology, LSP teachers and researchers can access discipline-specific materials and situations and compile corpora of specialized texts. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Computer-mediated</span> communication provides learning tools and a gateway to the discourse community. Technology also provides opportunities for collaborating, creating virtual environments and online courses, and fostering learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. These applications are examined within the current LSP scenario, paying attention to conditions and challenges for implementation, as well as to the roles of teachers and learners. This article also points to areas that merit further analysis from an LSP perspective, such as the use of different technologies and modes for effective learning, the analysis of specialized texts, and the integration into LSP of emerging technologies that have made their way into social uses.

<p>Abstract Students of today are digital natives. They acquire their digital literacy autonomously and are adept at using various <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>y (ICT) tools to enrich their daily leisure life. Although prior research has addressed such phenomenon and its relation to school learning, the focus was mostly on students’ adoption of ICT tools to facilitate their learning. This study takes a further step by relating students’ digital literacy to their school curriculum and using the pedagogy of negotiated learning to improve their learning <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The proposed negotiated learning design is to scaffold students along the authenticity–generalizability continuum; from operation-oriented knowledge and experience of ICT tools to the theory and technique of tools development and operation. It is expected that, by relating the school learning to students’ digital literacy, the way of students’ autonomously acquiring their digital literacy outside school may help them develop <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in school learning. For validating the proposal, an experiment with 36 university students studying the engineering course of multimedia technology has been implemented and evaluated. The qualitative results showed that participants developed their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to exercise their digital literacy to resolve the difficulties they faced during Web exploration and data collection for their school learning. The quantitative data also evidenced their improvement of learning <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The findings and the way how the learning practice is designed and implemented should offer teachers a different perspective of connecting school learning with students’ digital literacy acquired outside schools. Moreover, under the trend of youngsters’ digital literacy development, the findings provide a positive perspective on students’ digital literacy.</p>

<p>No longer are students’ experiences with new languages limited to their textbooks or immediate environment. With the pervasiveness of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and the increased awareness of the importance of having technology in a classroom, both teachers and students all over the world are being provided with technological tools that will further accelerate their ability to acquire or teach a second or foreign language. Technology integration in the classroom has become an important aspect of successful teaching. It has triggered many researchers to investigate different aspects of such integration. In addition, it could be an effective teaching tool when used to engage all students in the learning process. The results of the study show that teachers have positive attitudes toward the use of technology, particularly computer. The focal point of the project was to promote students’ communicative competence and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> via the implementation of technological tools. This study aimed at investigating the perceptions of EFL teachers about the use of technology in their classes and factors affecting technology implementation in Iranian Language Institutes. Descriptive statistics and sample t-test were used to analyze the questionnaire data. Results obtained from both the quantitative and qualitative data revealed teachers’ perceptions about integrating technology in their classes, incentives for teachers who use technology, types of technology used, facilitating and inhibiting factors affecting technology implementation, and the different attitudes of male and female teachers toward using technology. According to the results, teachers had positive attitudes regarding the use of technology, in particular computer, in their classrooms.</p>

<p>As a knowledge generator, the university has always worked towards the internationalization of its research function, based on the researchers’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. As from the 1990’s, as a consequence of the globalization process, this assertion is no longer restricted to the research function, but also includes the teaching function. Nowadays, the university should work to produce pluriversity knowledge, that is, contextual knowledge to the extent that the principle organizing its production is its possible application. As the knowledge is applied beyond the university walls, the initiative to formulate the problems one intends to solve and to determine criteria for their relevance is the result of sharing between researchers and users. In pluriversity knowledge production, unilaterality is replaced by interactivity, which has gained enormous power by the revolution in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies. Technological development is considered one of the most important tools for internationalization and for the use of the web to strengthen distance education and build collaborative research networks. As a result of globalization, the university increasingly needs to find regional synergies and intensify networks so as to stimulate and expand existing forms of transnational cooperation and multiply them in the framework of bilateral or multilateral agreements, in line with principles of mutual benefit. In this sense, Latin American Nursing has made efforts to transnationalize teaching and research institutions and establish regional collaborative networks. Initiatives in this sense include welcoming foreign students, mainly in graduate programs; international associations involving consulting services to foreign universities; collaborative research projects, distance education, virtual learning, faculty mobility, on-line libraries, research funding for students and faculty, among others. Some regional actions are just beginning, such as student exchange at undergraduate level and curriculum adaptations, while others are flourishing, such as the Collaborative Networks coordinated by the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (nursing in patient safety, mental health nursing, child health nursing, nursing researchers and HIV, care management, nurse migration, nurses in elderly health, nursing journal editors etc.); the offering of distance education, such as the courses offered to health professionals from Latin American countries with a view to skills development in drugs abuse control and the Electronic journal portal in the Virtual Health Library-Nursing, currently joining 18 Nursing journals published in Brazil, Colombia, Chile and Spain. Thus, transnational research centers need to be created, addressing themes and problems of specific interest to this region, and the dissemination of their research results needs to expand.

<p>This study it to verify the validity of Korean version of DELES (distance education learning environment survey) and analyze its relationship with learning achievement and distance education satisfaction. The target population of this study is students of K <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> university and a total of 254 cases are used for the analysis. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis is applied to verify 6 factors of DELES and structural equation analysis is applied to examine the relationship between distance education learning environment and learning achievement and distance education satisfaction. The study result shows that DELES is composed of six factors such as instructor support, student interaction &amp; collaboration, personal relevance, authentic learning, active learning and student <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and its model fits are appropriate. The result of structural equation analysis shows distance education learning environment significantly influences distance education satisfaction directly as well as indirectly mediated by learning achievement. Learning achievement also significantly influences distance education satisfaction. Conclusions and implications are followed.</p>

<p>Besides the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and the various opportunities it provides for language learning, the multimedia CD-ROM, with its potential for integrating and offering different media in one storage medium, has created quite a stir amongst language teaching professionals in the 90s. The benefits of multiple modalities, online support tools, and instant feedback are believed to have the potential of increasing learner control, motivation, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. However, a closer look at what is actually available on the market, in this instance the sub-market of Business English multimedia programmes, reveals that many such learning tools fall short of the claims that have been made for them, at least in the eyes of pedagogues. As teachers and students do not always see eye-to-eye as far as the usefulness of particular learning tools and activities is concerned, it seems paramount to let the final user and ultimate target group have their say, as well. The present study focuses on the reactions and comments of 30 students of …</p>

<p>The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and World Wide Web have provided opportunities of developing e-learning systems. The development of e-learning systems has started a revolution for instructional content delivering, learning activities, and social communication. Based on activity theory, the purpose of this research is to investigate learners’ attitude factors toward e-learning systems. A total 168 participants were asked to answer a questionnaire. After factor analysis, learners’ attitudes can be grouped four different factors - e-learning as a learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> environment, e-learning as a problem-solving environment, e-learning as a multimedia learning environment, and teachers as assisted tutors in e-learning. In addition, this research approves that activity theory is an appropriate theory for understanding e-learning systems. Furthermore, this study also provides evidence that e-learning as a problem-solving environment can be positively influenced by three other factors.</p>

<p>This paper examined the effects of a blogging centered curriculum on the development of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> self-efficacy of students taking a general education class. The class used a hybrid model (in class and online) that both integrated and strongly encouraged blogging on a community style, open source blog. The curriculum was designed to both create a more distributed educational structure and to develop greater <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and participation in student activity. It was hypothesized that as students engaged in increasingly complex <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> activities they would develop greater strength in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> self-efficacy in organization and differentiation of information and reaction to and generation of information. 367 undergraduate students participated in the current study. A pre-, post-test format was used to measure whether there were significant changes in strength of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> self-efficacy, with the inclusion of a control group of a more traditionally-structured class. The results showed that a blogcentric course has impacts on the increases in students’ <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> self-efficacy, particularly for reactive/generative self-efficacy. The findings are discussed in light of potential implications on the future direction of education.</p>

The context is one that acknowledges that learning increasingly dissipates out into <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>space.Inspired by Gilles Deleuze and Michel Foucault, the article explores preconditions for professionalizing the teacher using project work as a generalized case. Project work claims to anticipate initiation into <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and reflects new power relations between professionals and clients as well. It is assumed that project work illustrates the transition from traditional school forms to a more individualized society where <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies media (ICT) are increasingly integrated in learning.

<p>This paper argues that if used correctly, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">computer-mediated</span> courseware (CMC), in the form of an online Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) such as Blackboard or Moodle, has the potential to offer adult learners in university settings an optimal <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive environment for learning English as a second language at a distance. The paper firstly considers how to promote learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> through offering participants choices during the initial stages of a course through a negotiated syllabus. It then divides the language learning process into metacognitive and cognitive linguistic capacities and provides examples of strategies to increase <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in these spheres. <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> with regard to metacognitive linguistic capacities can be developed first by the multimodal aspect of CMC, in particular, the unprecedented access to resources, second, through the array of mediums to select in the creation and submission of assignments and third, through the notion of ‘dissemination’ (Mayes, 2002), which allows for ‘vicarious learning’ (Bandura, 1986). <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> with regard to cognitive linguistic capacities can be promoted through goal-oriented participant interaction on spoken and written forums on the platform, followed by consciousness-raising language activities guiding students to notice patterns in the language. In conclusion, it is suggested that a VLE might lead to optimum learning through the facilitation of a state of ‘flow’ or ‘autotelic’ activity, a concept closely related to <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and intrinsic motivation.</p>

<p>This article presents a survey of computer-based tracking in CALL and the uses to which the analysis of tracking data can be put to address questions in CALL in particular and second language acquisition (SLA) in general. Adopting both quantitative and qualitative methods, researchers have found that students often use software in unexpected ways, a finding which has consequences for the notion of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and underscores the need for learner training. In addition, researchers, especially those in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">computer-mediated</span> communication (CMC), have demonstrated the operation of fundamental SLA principles and also extended our understanding of those principles. Finally, comparison of students’ actual use of software and their self-reported use of software reveals the danger of over reliance on self-report data. Although logistically challenging and potentially time-consuming, analysis of tracking data goes a long way in putting CALL on solid empirical footing.</p>

<p>Abstract The concepts of teacher and learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> have played an important role in the context of language teaching and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> over the past few years. The full potential of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> resources, even authentic information resources, has largely remained unused for language learning and teaching. Organisational and affective factors have discouraged many teachers from using the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> for language teaching. The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>-enhanced object-oriented multiple-user domain(MOO) can serve as a tool to select and enhance <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> resources, while at the same time expanding the possibilities of the traditional classroom. Its text-based, synchronous and asynchronous communications resources are integrated within a common interface. Its support mechanisms are good for language teachers, who are only too often left alone with the new technology. The author argues for an intricate interdependence of pedagogy and technology, and sees teacher <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and the MOO as a promising combination for language teaching …</p>

<p>Abstract As we delve deeper into the world of online learning in our attempts to evaluate our Computer-Aided Self-Access Language Learning (CASA-LL) framework ( Adnan &amp; Zamari, 2011 ), we began working closely with e-course developers and online learning managers in different countries and educational institutions to elicit their personal experiences regarding e-learning as a whole. Moving from a macro to micro point-of-view, we noticed three components in our framework that were very relevant to course instructors and classroom tutors namely needs, design and learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> - as they move their teaching from real life to the virtual universe. More interestingly, we also noticed that these three components are not just relevant to language instructors but they are relevant to all educators who wish to embrace e-learning wholeheartedly. On the downside, given that many educational institutions (in Malaysia at least) are not yet ready for e-learning or are just beginning to develop an e-learning infrastructure without clear directions, very few Malaysian academics can be seen as “true” e-learning developers and/or instructors. To collect empirical data on this critical phenomenon, we identified and personally approached two highly experienced Malaysian academics who have attempted to embrace e-learning as part of their academic existence. This research paper shares their personal drive, feelings, failures and successes given the fact that both of them had chosen to work outside of the system as it were - to prove to their peers the virtues of e-driven learning and to show others that e- learning is the path to the future. Using excerpts from unstructured narrative interviews and snippets of informal <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communication</span> with our two participants, we found that although they come from different academic backgrounds, they somehow shared common goals and faced nearly the same challenges and difficulties in their ongoing efforts to encourage, promote and support e-learning deployment.</p>

<p>Problem statement: Bullying is a serious problem in American schools a nd is characterized by aggressive behavior distinguished by unequal power and the intention to cause physical, social, or emotional harm to others Bullying is evolving from the classic image of a big schoolyard bully picking on smaller kids to a more technologically, sophisti cated model of kids using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> technology to electronically tease, bully and harass their peers with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">texting</span>, voic<span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s and posts on publi c websites, like <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>, that are popular with youn g students. While parents are and should be encouraged and trained to recognize understand the insidious nature of techno bullying, it is not enou gh. The schools should take an active stance against bu llying and this includes training teachers and othe r personnel to be trained to recognize the signs and to intervene in bullying. Approach: This article discussed a research project undertaken to get asse ss the following: how educators recognize bullying, what they can do and actually do to intervene as we ll as their need for more training and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to intervene.

<p>The digitalization of academic interactions and collaborations in this present technologically conscious world is making collaborations between technology and pedagogy in the teaching and learning processes to display logical and systematic reasoning rather than the usual stereotyped informed decisions. This simply means, pedagogically, learning is being revolutionized with visible transformation from quantity to higher quality. Through independent, self-paced learning; students interact with technologies to review, construct, analyze, and make submissions. It is to be noted that the inclusion of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) into Language education gives vent to new learning paradigms in language education and this in a way concomitantly redefines the role of the teacher as well as repositions the cognition level of the learners. This paper therefore intents to beam searchlight on possible strategy for achieving <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in second language learning through digitalization. It is to be noted that the challenges of second language learners may not be resolved totally in the language classroom, hence there is the need for the teacher to become a facilitator thereby paving way for students’ self- discovery through different <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-tasks and navigating system inherent in this computer infested world. This paper therefore displays a phase of digitalized pedagogy in the language classroom.</p>

The primary aim of the project was to promote the autonomous practice of literacy in L2, while reflecting upon the linguistic codes and pragmatics of L1 and L2 through the correction of errors. Alongside previous work ( Appel, 1999 , Appel and Mullen, 2000 &amp; 2002; Appel and Gilabert, 2002 , Braun, 2006 , Munoz Vicente, 2013 , Schenker, 2012 , Ushioda, 2000 ), the present study is based on the axiomatic principles of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and reciprocity in order to detect weak points in the project. The varying levels of motivation within the tandem pairs and an insufficient command of the native language are identified as the main pitfalls.</p>

This article looks at the possibility of developing EFL learner’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> through application of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> as an electronic portfolio. For this purpose, an experiment was set up with two randomly selected groups. The experimental group (N=42) was instructed through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> portfolio process and the control group (N=42) was taught by typical ways of teaching English. The data were collected using observation and questionnaire. Comparing and analysing the outcomes showed a significant improvement in the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the first group of learners. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Email</span> portfolio had positive influence on the encouragement of learner’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and their classroom interaction. This research provides enhance for the role of electronic portfolio as a way of on-going assessment of one’s own work and the role of technology as a useful tool for give the conventional methods of language teaching to a new way.</p>

<p>How can educators empower and encourage their students to be more proactive, and give them the tools necessary to learn on their own, utilizing digital language learning resources in a culturally sensitive way? Described below is a project that introduced students to how technology and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> can empower the independent language learner. The goal was for the students to develop knowledge of and confidence in self-instruction and learn how to use technology and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> to further their language education independently. This article first outlines research into autonomous language learning with computers, offers a list of key elements for autonomous language learning, gives a description of how an independent language learning project was implemented and reports on results of student surveys that measured student response to the project. These students lacked the skills, knowledge and confidence to study on their own. However, by learning autonomous language learning concepts, and with instruction on how technology and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> can support a digital language learner, they gained the understanding and confidence to set and accomplish language learning goals on their own.</p>

<p>Introduction Dream job: Working where valued as a professional art educator; teaching professionally committed students; working with quality school personnel; having time and support to continue active research and writing interests; working in a supportive and collegial atmosphere. (Professor) There is a developing consensus that the preparation of teachers should become central to art education research (Davis, 1990; Day, 1997; Galbraith, 1995; Zimmerman, 1994; 1997). Research exists on specific art teacher preparation programs (Carroll, Jones, &amp; Sandell, 1995; Day, 1997; Galbraith, 1997; Sevigny, 1987; Thompson &amp; Hardiman, 1991; Willis-Fisher, 1993; Zimmerman, 1997), and there is a growing interest in examining art preservice teachers’ beliefs about teaching art (Grauer 1998; Kowalchuk, 1999; Short, 1995). Yet there is a lack of research on college level faculty-the teachers of teachers-whose qualifications, expertise, beliefs, and practices, shape and define art education within over 600 diverse institutions that have some association with preparing art teachers today (Galbraith, 1997; Hutchens, 1997). This lack of attention to faculty issues is not surprising, given that the data on faculty members associated with teacher education, in general, is sparse (Ducharme &amp; Ducharme, 1996; Howey &amp; Zimpher, 1989; Murray, 1995). Ducharme (1993) suggested that faculty members who prepare teachers are formerly public school teachers who enter higher education to seek better rewards and to have more <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in their professional lives. Faculty work involves paying attention to issues affecting conditions of employment and institutional expectations (Boyer, 1990; Fullan, 1996). It also involves paying attention to decisions that affect job satisfaction, career patterns, as well as professional and personal happiness (Ducharme, 1993). As with teachers teaching in school settings (Goodson, 1992; Huberman, 1993), faculty work is intimately affected by daily interactions with students, colleagues, and administrators (Jordan, 1994). Who then are the art education college-level faculty members that prepare future art teachers? Where do they teach? What are their jobs like? What are their roles, responsibilities, and beliefs in relation to art teacher education? This article reports on data taken from an ongoing research project that aims to identify faculty who teach art education within the U.S., the institutions in which they teach, their specific faculty roles and responsibilities, and their practices and beliefs about art teacher education. Given the broad context of this research and its overall qualitative nature, my intention is to provide the reader with a sense of the issuesthe flavor-that part of this research has uncovered. To this end, I will report on where education faculty members teach, their qualifications, and what they teach, and on specific aspects of their job descriptions, especially those related to teaching and research. I will briefly discuss how selected faculty members view their jobs currently and in the best possible worlds. I will conclude with implications for developing a research agenda that studies art teacher education faculty. Data Sources The data for this article are taken from two sources: First, I sent an open-ended questionnaire to 500 faculty members who worked at a variety of institutions (e.g.; research, teaching, liberal arts, religious, professional art school, private, public, large, small, and so forth) within the U.S. Faculty names, addresses, and institutions were gathered from the NASA Higher Education Division membership list, intensive searches of institutional homepages on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, annual NAEA Convention programs, and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> listserv associated with the NAEA Research Task Force on Teacher Education. Of the 500 questionnaires mailed, 167 were returned from 44 states, with a return rate of 33 percent. Of these, 19 questionnaires were unusable, because, for example, art education was no longer taught at that institution. …</p>

<p>This study examined the curricula of well-known fashion schools and educational programs through personal interviews with industry professionals. The purpose of this study was to identify the characteristics of fashion programs that are designed to improve the creativity of students. Six fashion schools in Western Europe and the United States were selected based on the number of graduates included in the Designer Handbook published by Fairchild Books. Two Korean professionals from each school were interviewed either by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> or in person, resulting in a total of 12 interviews. The data were analyzed qualitatively. The results indicated that the management styles as well as the curricula of these schools include features that enhanced student creativity. The schools are located in major fashion cities and have a close relationship with industry that is maintained to provide hands-on opportunities to students. The schools have clear and solid educational goals with instructional styles that provide students significant <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and responsibility. The instructors work closely with individual students to guide them through their projects and help develop students` unique styles. The schools utilized the instructions and studios as well as the social and cultural environments to help students acquire creative thinking and creative behavioral patterns. The findings of this study have implications for educators who wish to develop effective educational programs that enhance student creativity.</p>

<p>This paper reports on the task-based interaction of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners in the 3D multiuser virtual environment (MUVE) Second Life. The discussion first explores research on the precursors of MUVEs, text-based 2D virtual worlds known as MOOs. This is followed by an examination of studies on the use of MUVEs in Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL). The discussion then focuses on an investigation of the Second Life-based text <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> of learners located at a university in Japan. Data analysis reveals that the environment, and tasks, elicited types of collaborative interaction hypothesized as beneficial in the sociocultural account of language development. Collaborative interaction identified in the data involved peer-scaffolding focusing on lexis, and correction. The data further showed that the participants actively maintained a supportive atmosphere through the provision of utterances designed to signal interest, and the extensive use of positive politeness. These factors facilitated social cohesion, intersubjectivity, and the consistent production of coherent target language output focused on the tasks. Participant feedback was broadly positive, and indicates that specific features of Second Life such as individual avatars, coupled to the computer-based nature of the interaction, appeared to enhance discourse management, engagement, and participation. The findings suggest that Second Life provides an arena for learner centered social interaction that offers valuable opportunities for target language practice, and the development of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Areas of potential for future research are identified.</p>

<p>Abstract This paper focuses on a most significant domain of inner power of teachers’ lives—their leadership of student learning. Traditional conceptions of teacher leadership owe much to the presumption of a classroom, or a formally designated site, where teacher instructed learning takes place. However, the rise of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, with its ready availability of information has resulted in a shift towards much greater <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in student learning. The study reported here explores the perceptions of students, teachers, and parents about this shift to teacher-less learning, and the consequences it has for how we are to understand teacher leadership, especially where it concerns student engagement and participation in school. It also explores the efforts teachers themselves have made to understand their role amid these new realities.</p>

<p>Abstract The teaching of accounting sciences requires innovative alternative methodologies that allow a greater dynamism in students’ learning processes, encouraging their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in order to foster greater understanding and ownership of accounting topics covered in class. In that sense, the use of ICT for educational purposes has been positioned as a dynamic and interactive alternative that allows the application of knowledge and encourages the feedback in the learning process. This paper aims to reflect on the use of ICT in accounting education as a strategy to improve teaching and learning processes in students of the Department of Finance of Metropolitan Institute of Technology of Medellin. It is proposed a teaching method with a learning virtual object through a virtual mediator of accounting formulations. It has a pedagogical purpose of providing students with a conceptual and practical tool to interpret and analyze accounting and financial topics at the enterprise level. It is observed that the interaction between accounting graph logic and logic of dynamic perception facilitates the processes of teaching and learning in the disciplines of accounting and finance. It is reflected in greater motivation and understanding of mathematical equations in financial area that will carry out to experimentation of knowledge learned in the classroom.</p>

<p>Exponential growing of scientific and technological knowledge of nowadays society demands new abilities and competences of theirs citizens. In the other hand, the development of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies (ICTs) and the low cost of equipments provide a new teaching strategy, namely distance education, through intranet or <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>. The familiarity with of scientific method stimulates <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in obtaining information, critical thinking and logical analysis of data. These are useful abilities for science students as well as for common citizens. Aiming the development of such abilities a distance course was developed in 45 hours, using mainly forum and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> in the Claroline platform with technical support of the Centro Nacional de Supercomputacao da UFRGS. All the students attending the course were from Fundacao Faculdade Federal de Ciencias Medicas de Porto Alegre. In this course the following topics were explored: (1) scientific knowledge x common sense, (2) different conceptions of science, (3) scientific method, (4) different categories of science publications, (5) principles of Logic, (6) deduction x induction (7) paper analysis simulation. Scientific project writing was taught/learned through the following items: (1) choice of a problem, (2) bibliography revision, (3) agencies for funding, (4) project presentation by videoconference and (5) analysis of results. The course was evaluated by Likert-type questionnaire and the results from students and teachers indicate a very successful outcome.</p>

<p>: This article presents a two-semester study that examines the effectiveness of threaded discussions for foreign language teaching methods courses. In particular, this study focuses on how students view the role of asynchronous <span style="background-color:lightgreen">computer-mediated</span> communication in the development of language pedagogy through an exchange with expert teachers from secondary schools. The author gathered data from 32 students who participated in weekly discussion boards, wrote monthly reflective logs, filled out surveys, and joined group interviews. The findings demonstrated that online discussions promoted scaffolding by which expert teachers assisted students in creating reflective messages. In addition, threaded discussions fostered learners’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and accountability while supporting collaborative learning through social interaction. The study suggests three essential ingredients to maximize the potential benefits of discussion board for language teacher training: (1) use of carefully designed tasks that engage critical thinking, (2) scaffolding strategies for monitoring group discussions, and (3) inclusion of online etiquette to avoid confusion and reduce personal conflicts.</p>

<p>This paper presents research on participant learning processes in challenge course workshops using the framework known as Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (<span style="background-color:lightgreen">CHAT</span>). <span style="background-color:lightgreen">CHAT</span> views learning as a shared, social process rather than as an individual event. Participants’ experiencing and learning was mediated by the physical and social conditions of the experience and by the contributions of other participants. The concept of mediation suggests that the meaning participants make of experience is not an individual event, but instead is enacted as a creative, collaborative process using cultural and institutional tools. The recognition that people’s physical, social and reflective learning processes are mediated, challenges longstanding assumptions about the radical <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of learners, about ‘direct experience,’ and about the centrality of independent, cognitive reflection in experiential learning. Empirical data showing processes of mediation are presented, and the implications for research and theory are discussed.</p>

<p>The project we intend to present arises from the need of enhancing the process of teaching and learning academic disciplines through and with an additional language. In this paper we shall describe some online modules of a CLIL course in Linguistics dedicated to foreign students of L2 Italian. The modules are part of a course delivered both in presence and at a distance with a dual focus: learning a content - Linguistics - through a foreign language - Italian - in an integrated dimension. The online course, inspired by constructivist and learner-centred approaches, presents a series of collaborative and communicative technology-based activities developed in a virtual classroom and structured around three main sections: thematic, social and linguistic. The first presents the contents of the course (Morphology) through a video lesson with a series of interactive multimedia activities, the second promotes interaction between teachers and students through forums and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>s, the third offers a virtual self-access centre with pathways and resources that students can choose, according to their levels and needs, to learn the Italian language.</p>

<p>Online supervision mainly focuses on written communication and electronic drafts, while offline supervision comprises physical and social clues, verbal communication, and drafts of texts. This article focuses on supervisors’ written <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communication</span> about drafts of undergraduate student dissertations. Theoretically, these utterances form part of the communicative exchanges performed in the practice of supervision. This means that supervision is an emergent phenomenon that relates to its past, current, and future states. The setting was a dissertation course within a bachelor programme in behavioural science. The data consists of 423 utterances from four supervisors. The utterances were analysed and categorised, and the results show different qualities and degrees of identifications in the supervisors’ communicated utterances. The study shows that the quality of supervisors’ utterances embraces the difference between the application of comments, points of view, instructions, and questions. This implicates the importance of supervisors’ awareness of the nature and the combination of their utterances if they want to increase the student <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> when supervising online.</p>

<p>Web-based translation memory (TM) is a recent and little-studied development that is changing the way localisation projects are conducted. This article looks at the technology that allows for the sharing of TM databases over the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> to find out how it shapes the translator’s working environment. It shows that so-called pre-translation–until now the standard way for clients to manage translation tasks with freelancers–is giving way to web-interactive translation. Thus, rather than interacting with their own desktop databases as before, translators now interface with each other through server-based translation memories, so that a newly entered term or segment can be retrieved moments later by another translator working at a remote site. The study finds that, while the interests of most stakeholders in the localisation process are well served by this web-based arrangement, it can involve drawbacks for freelancers. Once an added value, technical expertise becomes less of a determining factor in employability, while translators lose <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> through an inability to retain the linguistic assets they generate. Web-based TM is, therefore, seen to risk disempowering and de-skilling freelancers, relegating them from valued localisation partners to mere servants of the new technology.</p>

<p>A weblog (blog or Web log) has recently become one of the most widely used <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> applications. The current study concerns developing a blog specifically designed for learners learning English as a foreign language. The study investigated the effects of extensive writing by comparing the writing performance in the first three and the last three blog entries written by the participants. The study also conducted a survey to examine participants’ blogging process and their perception of blogging. The results of the study show that writing on blogs could enhance participants’ overall writing performance, promote participants’ autonomous monitoring of their own writing, and promote positive attitudes toward foreign‐language writing. From its findings, the study concluded that writing weblogs in an online environment could be beneficial in improving learners’ writing skills, enhance learners’ motivation to write, and foster both learners’ monitoring strategies and learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.</p>

<p>Nearly 6,000 science questions collected from five different web-based, TV-based and school-based sources were rigorously analyzed in order to identify profiles of K-12 students’ interest in science, and how these profiles change with age. The questions were analyzed according to their topic, thinking level, motivation for and level of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in raising the question, the object of interest and its magnitude, and psychological distance of the object in question from the asker. Characteristics of the asker, such as gender, grade level, and country of origin were also considered, alongside characteristics of the data source, such as language, setting (<span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, school, TV), and the potential science-attentiveness of the users. Six meta-clusters of children’s and adolescents’ interest in science were identified using cluster analysis of their self-generated science questions. A developmental shift in interest from non-classical to classical school science subjects was noted. Other age-related developments, such as an increase in thinking level as reflected by the questions, a decrease in organization level and the psychological distance of the object in question with age were also explored. Advantages and shortcomings of web-based data collection for educational research are discussed, as are the implications of the results obtained using this methodology for formal science education. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.&nbsp;J Res Sci Teach 46: 999–1022, 2009</p>

<p>A 5-year primarily qualitative study of a major effort to bring the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> to a large urban school district in the United States suggests that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use brought about unplanned as well as planned change in classroom roles and relationships.

<p>The main title of the recent UNTELE conference refers to the question whether CALL development is technology- or pedagogy-based. In this paper, I will argue, not surprisingly, that it is both. Our own research at the Centre for Language and Communication Studies at Trinity College Dublin over the past 4 years has provided us with valuable insights on the relationship between pedagogy and technology. On the one hand, our centre has for years been actively involved in shaping the concept of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, not least through the writings of the centre’s founder, David Little. On the other hand, our involvement in the tandem network and tandem learning as an implementation of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> principles has given us first-hand experience in various <span style="background-color:lightgreen">computer-mediated</span> forms of language learning, especially e-mail and object-oriented multi-user domains (MOOs).

<p>The flexible use of digital recordings from EFL classrooms as well as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communication</span> with teaching experts are two promising ways of implementing e-learning in the context of initial teacher training. Our research focuses on how to blend these elements efficiently with the different theoretical and practical content layers of an introductory course “Teaching English as a Foreign Language” to foster the development of critical, reflective thinking of prospective teachers of English and to empower the learners. In this paper we discuss the concept of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> as a course strategy and argue that enabling a student to take responsibility and to make informed choices is the main route to an autonomous learner. We introduce and analyze learning activities such as working with multimedia-based case stories that include video episodes as situational anchors and conducting an einterview. These learning activities are two formats that integrate elearning and contact learning in a directed, interactive way to foster the learner’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The study is a follow-up of a pilot study on blended learning in a teacher training course and was conducted as action research in the 2004/05 winter semester. It combines qualitative and quantitative research methods and integrates multiple perspectives on the teaching and learning scenarios.</p>

With the variety of environment and method of English learning, independent English Learning through the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> is playing a more and more important role in modern English learning. It challenges the traditional learning approach, and also is forwardness.

<p><span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) has been used in language classrooms for more than two decades. Over this time, classroom use has moved from drill, text manipulation, and word processing to more interactive and communicative applications such as e-mail, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>, and web-based programs, requiring learners to acquire computer literacies. This chapter will begin by discussing both the parameters of ICT and the scope of literacies. It is then organized around discussion of the two types of literacies at the intersection of ICT and L2 learning: how new technologies facilitate acquisition of L2 literacies and what L2 literacies are needed for learners to participate in an increasingly digital world. Although research has mostly been limited to small-scale context-dependent case studies of individual classrooms, it has identified a number of issues that need to be considered as teachers (and learners) use ICT for language learning. Although ICT provides a natural context for learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, that <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> needs to be developed systematically. In addition, ICT provides a context for learner identity formation through hybrid uses of language(s), in ways unexpected by teachers and learners. These new ways of using language may empower and motivate learners. Similarly, whereas ICT provides opportunities for collaboration and interaction, they are not automatic, and instruction needs to be skillfully scaffolded for learners to benefit from such opportunities.</p>

<p>With the advent of the information age, multimedia and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> technology have been high on the agenda of college English teaching reform. Much research shows great progress has been made in the multimedia environment. However, it does not necessarily follow that there exist no problems in multimedia-based teaching. In order to further improve teaching, the application of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> technology has begun to gain more and more attention in recent years.This paper probes into the application of web in teaching. A 16-week experiment between the experimental group and the control group is conducted. Based on the comparison of the two tests that the two groups had before and after the experiment and an face-to-face interview, the author finds out that the web-based model can not only help the learners perform better but also enhance their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and independent thinking in learning, and so is their learning interest.</p>

<p>Students from the People’s Republic of China enrolled in an ‘English for academic purposes’ (EAP) programme at the National Institute of Education (NIE), Singapore is strongly encouraged to take an active role and be independent to some extent in its learning. For this purpose a self‐access centre (SAC) was set up where students themselves decide on the kinds of learning activities they wish to participate in at the centre. This weekly 1 hour session is built into the curriculum so that all students, regardless of their English proficiency, have the opportunity to develop <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in their learning. Unlike traditional self‐access centres, where worksheets usually form the core resource, the SAC at NIE taps resources from the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. Students can access these resources even when they are off campus. In addition, other resources, such as CDs, VCDs and reading materials, are available at the centre for students to use in order to improve their English.

<p>Abstract Globalization and the information-technology revolution demand that Japanese citizens develop a working knowledge of English to participate in the global communication process. This requires a radical departure from traditional language teaching practices. Japanese students need to develop learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and the skills to use authentic language texts in a cooperative learning context so that they can develop the intellectual and social skills to use English as an authentic global language among Japanese language speakers. Students at a women’s college in western Japan used an Australian junior high school social science text and personal and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> resources to put these principles into practice. Small permanent groups of students chose their own areas of study in designated topic areas, engaged in collaborative research, and presented their group findings in posters supported by oral and written reports. Diaries provided students with an effective means of reporting their understanding of the learning strategies employed to the teacher. The group discussions of the collected strategies helped students expand their working knowledge of English.</p>

<p>A public librarian is an occupation, which requires long-term. continuous training and difficult study to acquire and cultivate professional knowledge and skills. It is a necessity to achieve new knowledge, information and skills via appropriate retraining. A training system is the method which gives chances of retraining to public librarians. After examining some of the problems with the existing training system, it is apparent that the direction of training system needs to be decentralized. That is each local branch should be autonomous in terms of new training for librarians. For the method of training system, each autonomous unit would integrate the different theories to apply to the community-at-large and invite practical specialists from the local community to lecture. The training classes would be elective in that the each librarian could choose the classes he/she wants to take and give them credits for that, but the certificate for the class would also go towards completion for the required technical training. Finally, the utilization of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-education should be introduced, and the library association`s role strengthened, to help public librarians cultivate their specialties.</p>

The book begins with a lengthy introduction by Clark Kerr that not only provides an overview of change since time he coined phrase the city of intellect but also discusses major changes that will affect American universities over next thirty years. Part One examines demographic and economic changes, such as rise of nearly universal higher education, private gift and corporate sponsorship of research, new labor market opportunities, and increasing inequality among institutions and disciplines. Part Two assesses profound influence of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and other technologies on teaching and learning. Part Three describes how various forces of change affect nature of academic research and organization of disciplines and curriculum. Part Four analyzes consequences of change for university governance and means by which universities in future can maintain high levels of achievement while maintaining high levels of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.

<p>This paper reports on a study of environments in emerging <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> classrooms. At issue for this study is to what extent these ‘technological classrooms’ are providing a positive learning environment for students. To investigate this issue, this study involved an evaluation of the physical and psychosocial environments in computerized school settings through a combination of questionnaires and inventories that were later cross-referenced to case studies on a subset of these classrooms. Data were obtained from a series of physical evaluations of 43 settings in 24 school locations in British Columbia, Canada and Western Australia. Evaluations consisted of detailed inventories of the physical environment using the Computerised Classroom Environment Inventory (CCEI): an instrument developed specifically for this study. Data on psychosocial aspects of the environment were obtained with the What is Happening in this Class? (WIHIC) questionnaire administered to 1404 high school students making routine use of these computerized classrooms. Potential deficiencies in the physical environment of these locations included problems with individual workspaces, lighting and air quality, whereas deficiencies in the psychosocial environment were confined to the dimension of <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span>. Further analysis of these classroom environment data indicated that student <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> and Task orientation were independently associated with students’ Satisfaction with learning and that many physical (e.g.&nbsp;lighting and workspace dimensions) and psychosocial factors (e.g.&nbsp;students’ perceptions of Co-operation and Collaboration) were also associated. The results provide a descriptive account of the learning environment in ‘technology-rich’ classrooms and, further, indicate that ergonomic guidelines used in the implementation of IT in classrooms may have a positive influence on the learning environment.</p>

<p>CSCL (Computer Supported Co‐operative Learning), better called TSCL, Telematic (and IT) Supported Co‐operative Learning, seems to be driven by both social dynamics (like the tendency to reduce the formal training component in industrial settings, and have it replaced by training on the job, handling EPSS, etc) and technological facilities like <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>‐based communication tools. This paper reports a recent research plan that anticipates the situation where individual learners, all having their individual learning agendas, look for partners in their learning process. TSCL, then, can assist those learners to announce them to the learning community, and also find appropriate partners to co‐operate with. As far as educational institutes are concerned, we expect them to increase the level of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for the learner. Teaching in this case becomes ‘facilitating the information access to the learner’ and ‘facilitating the communication between actors in the learning process’.</p>

<p>As web technologies gradually become versatile and more powerful, more flexible paths and opportunities are revealed for self-directed learning and online assessment. It is hoped officials and advocates recognize IT related certification programs (NSSB Recognizes First IT Certification Program 2002). The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and Computing Core Certification (IC3®) certification program is designed for individuals to develop digital literacy skills, including fundamental computer and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use. The particular interest of the study is to explore the relative contributions of the Certification Recognition Program (CRP) and associated <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of participation and achieved literacy for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> computing &amp; technology (ICT), as well as the interactive influences of the degree programs and grade levels. Five hundred and ninety six male undergraduates majoring in IT were invited to participate in the Certification Recognition Program for a calendar year. The certification recognition program covers a set of three standardized tests based on the IC3® by CertiportTM. The study found ICT literacy is predicated by the students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of participation (AP) in the Certification Recognition Program (CRP), and SP was related to the grade level (GL) and the enrolled degree program (DP), indirectly affecting ICT literacy as a result of the transiting effect of AP.</p>

<p>This documental study has the qualitative approach of a case study. It analyzes how <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> has been developed in nursing students process of knowledge construction, in a context mediated by the use of educational <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> in Learning Management Systems (LMS). The analyzed materials were eight discussions promoted by students, professors, and monitors in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> session of TelEduc LMS. The software NVivo was used to categorize data and Content Analysis for the analysis of information. Data analysis used Freire as a reference point, revealing that nursing students need to develop their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> by acknowledging their incompleteness. Professors can aid this process by problematizing and developing critical dialogical relations. The potential of the educational <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> as a pedagogical tool is highlighted because it encourages students to autonomously seek knowledge.</p>

<p>In the age of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, students are clamoring for immersive and participatory learning experiences, but how can teachers share <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> without losing control of their classrooms? In an effort to address this important question, this article suggests three mentorship modes that educators can employ in order to effectively engage with today’s interactive learners. Lecture-based instruction is a single mode form of teaching in which information is disseminated by a lone authority-figure. In contrast, learning-centered mentorship is a three-mode process in which <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is shared and authority flows in multiple directions at once: bottom-up (modeling), laterally (collaborating), and topdown (organizing and supervising). This work draws on research and theories related to student-centered pedagogy, as well as the trial and error experimentation of the author and interviews with successful participatory educators working at Tribeca Flashpoint Media Arts Academy in Chicago, a school devoted almost exclusively to problem-based and project-based learning.</p>

<p>Paulo Freire’s classical book Pedagogy of the Oppressed (1968), written in Portuguese, calls for a pedagogy that would assume a new relationship between student, teacher and society. Freire christens traditional peda- gogy a banking system, for it considers the student an empty shell waiting to be filled with knowledge, like a piggy bank. He argues strongly for education to treat the student a co-creator of knowledge. The younger generation need not meekly accept society’s status quo and education should help them to deal with reality critically and creatively so that they can transform their worlds. This paper explores how a tech savvy student can learn a new language, based on the dictum of Friere, using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> apps such as Mango and Mosalingua. It explains how a gadget like <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> can offer learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> which guarantees vocabulary enrichment, pronunciation models, visualization, and comprehension of cultural complexities in respect of a new language. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Smartphone</span>s and Tablets have revolutionized our way of living. Initially, we were only aware of such applications as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s and search engines. But with the advent of new breeds of smart- phones, thousands of new applications are being uploaded into the Android and the iOS markets. Only the creme de la creme of the population knows about the benefits and the usage of these applications. A majority of students are unaware of the existence of these applications, which can be used as part of cus- tomized learning pedagogy where the learner can learn at his/ her own pace and convenience. In this context, the relationship between the power of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> applications and a theory of pedagogy meant for the support of the oppressed needs our keen attention. Pedagogy of the Oppressed Paulo Freire’s Pedagogy of the Oppressed was written at the time of decolonization when former colonies like Africa, Asia, and Latin America became autonomous countries. Decoloniza- tion is an important subject of the book. This book is not about nation’s transformation but about individual and collective hu- man development. The discussion is about the internal colo- nization which is nothing but being oppressed even after the colonial forces and the military forces have left the state. The colonization discourses still remain. Still there are such ques- tions around as, which culture, caste, or language is superior to other? Freire’s book is about healing the self. The important issue in it is how the pedagogy of the oppressed helps people to coun- ter the internal oppression. It tells us about a pedagogy which can help people, especially students, from oppression. There are two propositions. The first one is to identify the subject dis- courses like the economic and social ties that keep people down. The second proposition is that transformation of the oppressed is possible when such people can liberate themselves from op- pression.</p>

<p>Taught Master’s students have been largely overlooked in research into learners’ engagement with digital technologies. This article reports work to redress this imbalance, in which an extended <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> correspondence was conducted with 23 Master’s students. Specifically, it investigates (1) the extent to which these students start their courses both functionally competent in the use of IT and digitally literate, and (2) the relationship between students’ engagement with digital technologies and their experience of transition to postgraduate study in five areas: knowledge and skills, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, ‘deeper’ learning, enculturation into an academic community, and self-concept. Findings suggest that students may initially be less functionally competent in IT than might be expected, but use these tools in an informed manner. Engagement with a wider range of digital technologies parallels their shift from novice to expert practice and their developing self-concept as researchers; however, non-digital means also remain…</p>

<p>There is a need to evaluate the benefits to children of integrated classroom and field-based learning. In this article, we describe a case study that involves children in the production of a field guide: an authentic task which integrates learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and open enquiry with field work, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICT) and classroom-based activities. We consider the impact that this task has had upon aspects of the children’s factual writing. Although we found no improvement in the ability of the children to write sentences and only a marginal improvement in their ability to write for composition and effect, we did find a significant improvement in their ability to write about the ecology of an animal that they had encountered firsthand when compared to an animal that they had not encountered in life.</p>

<p>Abstract Online teacher education is of growing interest and so is the study of motivation as a key factor in technology-mediated learning environments. This study is based on a pre-service language teacher education programme in Patagonia, a southern Argentinian region with no face-to-face training offers, limited <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> access and a large number of unqualified teachers. Our goal is to broaden the understanding of online teacher education programmes at undergraduate level in contexts where most trainees are practicing teachers and where online education is the only possibility for holding a teaching qualification. We focused on the motivating factors that led 71 trainees to enrol and to remain in this online teacher training course. Through a mixed methods approach, the trainees completed an online survey ( n &nbsp;=&nbsp;71) and participated in a follow-up interview ( n &nbsp;=&nbsp;24). Results showed that obtaining a teaching degree, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and individual activities were key factors in initial and sustaining motivation. Participants’ experiences challenged collaborative learning in an online environment.</p>

<p>Abstract A French blended course called Parle avec Moi was developed at the University of Padua. Parle avec Moi was based on a wiki platform (PBworks). The aims of the course were manifold: linguistic, metalinguistic (since conversational analysis was the main theoretical topic of the course), and methodological. The virtual context created using Web 2.0 tools helped the students consolidate and widen their active role and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, fostering many of the key competences for lifelong learning outlined by the European Parliament and the Council framework (European Union, 2008), and above all, to develop their digital competence (2006/962/EC). In particular, students experimented with the three dimensions of the concept of digital competence outlined by Calvani et al . (2009) in their research project for assessing digital competence. Besides these introductory materials, which led to a certain savoir faire, to a sound understanding of the opportunities and potential risks of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>-based communication, students were successfully instructed in becoming ( savoir etre ) good builders of common knowledge in a wiki community.</p>

<p>Distance learning programs in social work education have been growing exponentially throughout the United States. This study interviewed Master of Social Work (MSW) students enrolled in two synchronous distance-learning courses that employed a blended pedagogy, and evaluates their insights about the learning experience. For these two courses, material was presented via video conferencing and supplemented with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online media</span> at two campuses at a large school of social work. In order to give students a voice about their experiences, data were collected using semi-structured face-to-face interviews. Common themes included: <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, emotional connectedness, technological challenges, and knowledge acquisition. Both the strengths and challenges related to distance learning are discussed.</p>

<p>This study was conducted to extend our understanding of the impacts on instruction when asynchronous text-based <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> communication technology is integrated into distance courses. The researchers interviewed twelve university instructors to examine Berge’s (1995) four roles of the use of technologies as an interview guide. Moore’s (1972) theory of transactional distance was used to interpret the data. The results revealed that as university instructors in distance education programs gain experience, they find it is possible to translate many face-to-face instructional strategies to the online classroom and learn the technical aspects necessary for effective use of asynchronous text-based <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> communication tools.

<p>Abstract People are looking for flexible learning to accommodate their needs for improvements. One option is through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> based learning or online learning. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> has provided people with unlimited access to information. Online learning enables lifelong learning become more accessible. The development of online learning offer opportunities for teachers to create mentor online as to support student engagement in learning. Online learning provides multimedia and instructional information. Therefore e-mentoring becomes a viable tool to help student engage in online learning. By using electronic communications, e-mentoring intends to develop and grow the skills, knowledge, confidence, and cultural understanding of the lesser skilled individual. E-mentoring enables teachers interacting with students through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>, online <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> and online bulletin board regardless of geographic location. Consequently, learners are capable to build their own knowledge when they feel connected by the activity in which their engage. The purpose of this research is to investigate learner’s factor toward e mentoring. The study aims to identify learner’s attitudes toward e- mentoring. In fact understanding learner’s attitude toward e-mentoring is essential to ensure learners can reap the benefits of mentoring. A survey analysis was carried out. A total of 205 participants were asked to answer a questionnaire. A factor analysis and multiple regression technique were carried out. Factor analysis result indicated there are two groups of learner’s attitude that is learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and teacher as assisted tutors. Finding shows that learner’s attitudes play a role in predicting e-mentoring. To ascertain the successful of e-mentoring program, this research provide evidence learner’s attitude are critical factors to ensure students would stay involve with their mentor.</p>

<p>The foundation of the Theological College in Belgrade is viewed in the context of complex political circumstances which followed the restoration of the Serbian state and the efforts of the Serbian church to gain <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and the right to elect bishops independently from the Universal Patriar<span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>e. Once having achieved these goals, and with a conviction that the achieved must be defended and maintained by knowledge and education, the state authorities founded a seminary for education of priests and teachers capable to carry out national and spiritual reformation. The accord between the state and the Church regarding the strategic aims enabled the very first vocational school in Serbia to develop continuously its curricula and hire better and better teaching staff each year. However, due to the change of circumstances, the state passed the laws by which it enforced its dominance and showed a clear intent to subordinate theological education to its control. Yet, by its continuous activity during two crucial centuries, the Seminary became a part of collective consciousness, and its cadres contributed actively to the creation of original cultural and value patterns and preservation of national identity of the Serbian nation. The brilliant history of this school and its precious experience can be of great encouragement not only to the researchers of our pedagogical inheritance but also to all those who are engaged in reforming and adjusting education in Serbia to the European standards. .</p>

<p>The theme of this special edition is ‘Governing and Governance in Education’. The way the education system is governed is important for society. However, despite its importance, educational governance is substantially underresearched in comparison with other aspects of the management in educational settings. Furthermore, governing does not have the same profile as other aspects of management in education, such as the work of the headteacher or leadership in educational settings. Policy changes in train in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, such as the increased <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of educational institutions, reduced funding for schools and colleges, the continual emphasis on enhancing student attainment and achievement, and the emphasis on inter-organisational collaboration are likely to enhance the importance of governing and governance. In addition, new approaches to governing and governance are needed in order to engage with diversity and to encompass a range of styles from different societies and contexts. This issue is of particular importance to me and my own research interests (Showunmi, 2012). Equality and diversity inhabit difficult and sometimes sensitive territory, reflecting the difficulties and sensitivities inherent in society. In that sense they are an inevitable – and welcome – part of the wider education landscape. Surely a 21st century school, college or university, with values of collaboration, free speech and the expression of all views, is exactly the place to embrace these issues through good governing and appropriate governance. This special edition includes a range of very varied perspectives on aspects of governing and governance. Each of the author’s articles has significant things to say. The James, et al.&nbsp;article identifies features of the context for school governance generally in England and within each aspect reviews the constellation of current challenges confronting school governing bodies. This article is followed by a fascinating contribution from Poultney that is seeking to investigate how a small independent girls school has, over the last four years, shaped and defined its governing body to support a new headteacher and uphold its Moravian roots through a Board of Trustees who oversee and delegate governor responsibilities to the governing committee. The next article, written by Fitzgerald and Drake, draws on a study that investigated the responsibility of primary school governors in the financial management of schools in the UK and the way these responsibilities are discharged. Baxter and Wise, the authors of the next article, examine the ways in which being a member of a federation governing body impacts upon the governor identities. Using a case study based upon a single academy federation, the investigation employs a framework for identity analysis to analyse qualitative in-depth interviews with members within governing organizations in the federation. In the following paper, Hill and James report on the findings from a research study that sought to gain a greater understanding of the ways in which senior staff contribute to further education college governance. They analyse how senior staff experience their role and how they contribute to college governance. The final paper by Cutajar, et al.&nbsp;focuses on the history and background of the reforms to the Maltese education system and the way that governing has developed as part of those reforms. It argues that the reforms, which were intended to promote collaboration between schools, have missed an opportunity to bring about distributed governance. This special edition has come about through the BELMAS Governing and Governance Research Interest Group. If you have an interest in governing and governance in education and would like to find out more about the Group, please contact the convenor, Dr Ron Hill (ronandjennyhill@ bt<span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>.com). Finally, I would like to thank all the authors for their excellent contributions to what I consider to be an important and timely edition of the journal.</p>

The main features of the original site geared towards the language learner were the creation of a virtual environment for tandem language learning and the provision of tools and data intended to help foster the development of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The new teacher interface supports the integration of tandem language learning activities in the foreign language classroom and addresses the difficult issue of performance assessment and task evaluation. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Computer-mediated</span> communication activities between students in different countries are notoriously difficult for teachers to monitor. Nevertheless, there is evidence that in certain situations it is beneficial for the teacher to be able to monitor these activities. The teacher interface of the ETR site offers a user-friendly interface which requires only basic computer skills, and gives teachers access to data such as the date of the most recently sent messages, the number of words sent by students and the percentages of text written by each student in their respective L1 and L2, without giving teachers access to the content of the messages, thus preserving students’ privacy. Furthermore, a slightly different version has also been designed for evaluation of the learning by the researcher investigating second language learning in an electronic tandem environment. This interface has been designed for setting up experiments and some of its features allow for control over variables related to the experiment. The interface records time stamps for sent and received messages.</p>

<p>Abstract This article discusses the informal learning of English by non-native speakers with particular reference to the role of virtual communities. The concept of informal learning is presented and related to current areas of interest in the literature such as incidental learning, and dynamic systems theory. Our research investigates how non-specialist language learners use the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> in their spare time to read and listen to English, and also communicate in English, notably in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>ies through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking website</span>s. The study looks particularly at the dynamics of these phenomena by studying a small number of non-native users of English over a period of two months. The results of this research will be used to question the relevance of the learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> paradigm, which has been a cornerstone of language learning policy in Europe for the past thirty years.</p>

<p>While the concepts and principles associated with learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> underpin a broad range of CALL applications and research projects, current debates and research paradigms in CALL do not provide adequate tools and models to investigate in depth the relationship between CALL and the development of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. This paper explores the potential of cultural-historical activity theory to study this relationship. Starting from the complex and multidimensional nature of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, it highlights some of the weaknesses in the CALL literature addressing some aspects of this relationship. Following a presentation of the main tenets of cultural-historical activity theory (<span style="background-color:lightgreen">CHAT</span>), including the notion of contradiction which is at the core of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">CHAT</span>, it then seeks to demonstrate how activity theory can assist us in rethinking our understanding of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the context of technology-rich language learning environments and in formulating suitable criteria and questions, which can guide judgemental and empirical analyses. The paper concludes by illustrating some of the principles explored through examples drawn from an activity-theoretical judgemental analysis of a French module delivered to first year students in Dublin City University.</p>

<p>The purpose of this study was to explore the Iranian EFL teachers’ familiarity, attitudes and willingness toward applying different <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> tools in their classrooms. It also investigated the platform problems and teachers’ main concerns towards integrating these tools. Accordingly, 263 EFL teachers who were randomly selected from different institutes in three Iranian provinces were asked to answer the researchers-made questionnaire. The results revealed that EFL teachers 1) are highly familiar with most of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> tools; 2) have highly positive attitudes towards using and integrating <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> tools in their classrooms; 3) are willing to use these technologies for developing certain language skills competency; and 4) are highly concerned about culturally inappropriate materials and students’ <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> dependability and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Furthermore, it was found that the results were affected by variables such as teachers’ age and educational degree. Finally, it was concluded that in spite of the EFL teachers’ positive attitudes and willingness towards these tools, still they are facing some challenging concerns about the application of the given tools due to some cultural and platform problems.

<p>The demand of responsibilities among teachers has evolved not only in classroom management but also to the extent of promoting communication and interpersonal skills. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social media</span> is integrated in schools and higher learning institutions for communication and reflection of learning which enhance teachers’ performance in leadership quality and effective teaching. This study was designed in a qualitative approach mainly to explore the extent of interest and enjoyment students experienced during an intensive ICT course. Blog was used as a medium for reflection during the class where students posted their creations of videos, posters and other ICT materials. The three needs investigated were namely <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness support. The researcher further examined on students’ awareness of the usefulness of the ICT skill they learned and how much they can use the blog for teaching and learning. Based on the Basic Psychological Needs Theory framework (BPNT), this study has adopted the direct observation, journal entry, and interviews as a triangulation approach.</p>

<p>This paper aims to outline a theory-based Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) course and to establish the rationale for adopting a holistic approach to the teaching of languages in tertiary education. Our work focuses on the interdependence between Content and Language Integrated Learning, and the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies (ICT), in particular regarding the learning of English within the framework of Telecommunications Engineering. The study first analyses the diverse components of the instructional approach and the extent to which this approach interrelates with technologies within the context of what we have defined as a holistic experience, since it also aims to develop a set of generic competences or transferable skills. Second, an example of a course project framed in this holistic approach is described in order to exemplify the specific actions suggested for learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and CLIL. The approach provides both an adequate framework as well as the conditions needed to carry out a lifelong learning experience within our context, a Spanish School of Engineering. In addition to specialized language and content, the approach integrates the learning of skills and capacities required by the new plans that have been established following the Bologna Declaration in 1999.</p>

<i> Patient Rambe </i></p>
<p>Introduction As university student interaction and sharing of electronic resources in Web-enabled environments are becoming an embedded practice (Ng’ambi &amp; Rambe, 2008), educators are under pressure to evolve pedagogical approaches (Salmon, 2007) that could support and leverage these forms of interactions. However, educators’ implementation of Web-enabled courses for first year university students is often constrained by varying student academic underpreparedness, large classes, and inadequate curriculum design (Jaffer, Ng’ambi, &amp; Czerniewicz, 2007) and student incapacity to learn when confronted with a learning environment that requires an unfamiliar degree of initiative and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (Tan &amp; Chan, 1997). The latter is the case for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social Media</span>-enhanced learning environments that often put additional cognitive demands on learners to generate, share, and meaningfully engage with Web content, notwithstanding their underdeveloped self-regulation and learning abilities. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social Media</span> denotes an aggregate of Web 2.0 based tools, applications, business models, and social networking that allows people to collaborate in novel ways at a large scale (Leadbeater, 2007). Instances of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social Media</span> encapsulate <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s, blogs, podcasts, multimedia sharing sites, and aggregation tools. Pargetter et al.&nbsp;(1998) suggest that students consistently identify independent learning and self-iscipline as basic goals of their university education, although many are unsure about how to achieve those goals. In <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social Media</span> where there is limited lecturer-student direct interaction, not only are students challenged by using social networking applications for meaningful learning, but rather how self-directed learning can be fostered in these quasi-formal learning spaces. As Dabbagh and Kitsantas (2005) suggest, in Web-based learning environments, the physical absence of the instructor and the increased responsibility demanded of learners to effectively engage with learning tasks may present difficulties for learners, particularly those with low self-regulatory skills. The challenge, therefore, is grasping how <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social Media</span> like <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> could impact student conceptual and practical understanding of Information Systems (IS) if it was appropriated for teaching and learning. Mindful of the uptake of these technologies in South African universities for sharing academic information, responding to student queries and building trust among academic communities (Moore, 2010), exploring the implications of implementing them in university is essential to effective pedagogical delivery. The South African government expects Information Systems (IS) education to produce technically competent graduates who not only know how to effectively apply Web-based technology for their lifelong learning, but also understand how to appropriate it to solve complex work-elated problems. Emphasising the social relevance of higher education training to nation development, the South African White Paper on Higher Education (Republic of South Africa, 1997) reiterates the need to develop professionals and knowledge workers with globally equivalent skills and who are conscious of their role in contributing to national development. As Shen, Lee, and Tsai (2007) comment, a vocational education system constantly involves meeting the needs and the new demand for highly skilled manpower, the continued progress of modern technology, the worldwide economic development, and the changing industrial structure. The above points out the central role that technological skills play in the structural dynamics of national development in addition to psychological development. The challenge however for IS practitioners is designing learning environments that afford the acquisition and development of sophisticated IS skills and respond to the learning needs of university learners. Graetz (2006) argues that the migration of content which lecturers traditionally delivered in lecture format to the Web is helping shift the function served by brick and mortar classrooms from information delivery to collaboration and discussion. …</p>

<p>Lina Lee University of New Hampshire The current study explores closely how using a combined modalities of asynchronous <span style="background-color:lightgreen">computer-mediated</span> communication (CMC) via blogs and face-to-face (FTF) interaction through ethnographic interviews with native speakers (L1s) supports autonomous learning as the result of reflective and social processes. The study involves 16 American undergraduate students who participated in blogs to develop their intercultural competence over the course of one-semester study abroad. The results show that blogs afforded students the opportunity to work independently (e.g., content creation) and reflect upon cross-cultural issues. Critical reflection, however, relied on the teacher’s guidance and feedback, as most of the students were cognitively challenged by not being able to clearly articulate different points of view. It is likely that students were not accustomed to reflecting. The findings also indicate that task type fostered <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in different ways. While free topics gave students more control of their own learning, teacher-assigned topics required them to critically think about the readings. Lack of access to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> at the host institution and family also contributed to a limited level of social interaction. The study concludes that well-designed tasks, effective metacognitive and cognitive skills, and the accessibility to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> are essential to maximize the potentials of blogs for learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and intercultural communication.</p>

<p>Seeing beyond corporate cultural boundaries is a necessary first step toward effective process integration and corporate transformation. But to ignore national culture is to invite failure. OVERVIEW: Culture creates barriers to business process reengineering. Three distinctive levels of culture must be recognized in process redesign-national, corporate and work group culture. American national culture has the most profound influence. Individualism and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> are key features of American culture that work against the logic of process integration and commonization by rewarding individuals for pursuing their own self-interests. This tendency also generates a lack of trust, which in turn creates barriers to sharing electronic data. Reengineering difficulties are exacerbated by an American fascination with technological solutions, and a view of new technology as a silver bullet that yields benefits automatically. Often, process redesign cannot be implemented without culture change. Culture can be influenced by exposing internal groups to external pressures, ensuring employee participation in reengineering, recognizing that training alone does not achieve culture change, redefining group boundaries, managing anti-champions, building trust, and leveraging the strengths of national and corporate culture. To compete effectively in world markets, many American corporations are attempting to redesign basic processes in ways that enable closer collaboration or integration of Marietta Baba is professor and chair of the Department of Anthropology at Wayne State University, in Detroit, Michigan.

Integration of business processes often is equated with the introduction of new information technology (IT). Investing in IT, however, does not guarantee benefits. In a review of several recent studies, Majchrzak reported failure rates for the implementation of computer-automated technology in American industry that ranged from 30 to 75 percent (1). One explanation for these difficulties is that IT is only an enabler of better business processes; as an enabler, it cannot of itself achieve process improvement. Adler and others have reviewed in detail changes in workforce skills, work procedures, organizational structure, strategy, and culture that must accompany the introduction of advanced computer-automation if corporations are to realize the full benefits of IT (2). Culture in particular is mentioned frequently as an important factor affecting redesign efforts, but its nature and implications typically are not understood sufficiently to provide a base of knowledge for planned culture change. In this article, we address this need by exploring the role of culture in business process-redesign, and by providing suggestions for managers who are engaged in implementing new information technology aimed at process change.

<p>With laptops, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s, tablets and broadband wireless access becoming more widely available, Web 2.0 is now entering schools. This changes the way students work and communicate, altering their relationship with knowledge, and generating new objectives for media literacy in the digital society. Thus, schools face new challenges and this paper aims at highlighting four of them. A first challenge relates to trust. Web 2.0 opens the classroom to the world and educators have to face new dangers and irrelevant uses, while bringing their students to gain better access to information and culture. The second challenge relates to teachers’ professional identities. The role of teachers is changing as Web 2.0 tools are being used by students, and policymakers should take this into account. A third challenge relates to a growing need to control working time, timetable organization and rhythm in schools. The fourth challenge that we underline is the need for common rules that allow students to benefit from the opportunities offered by Web 2.0 to develop their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and to foster ethical practices.</p>

<p>Because the new processes of domination to which people react are embedded in information flows, the building of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> has to rely on reverse information flows. –Manuel Castells, The Power of Identity Introduction In recent decades, advances in information technology have vastly increased the channels by which librarians and educators can connect patrons or students with relevant resources. Certainly, it is difficult for librarians today–whether in reference or technical services–to imagine doing their jobs without access to online databases, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> resources, cataloging or circulation software, and the many other tools we now take for granted. Similarly, it is difficult to imagine contemporary patrons voluntarily relinquishing the ability to search OPACs, export bibliographic citations, retrieve full-text articles from thousands of journals, or contact a librarian at all hours via e-mail, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>, or text messaging. These new information-seeking habits of patrons drive libraries–and librarians–to keep up with new applications of technology, whether by using blogs and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s to help promote the services we offer or by ensuring remote access to library resources on mobile devices. Given this centrality of technology to the evolving practice of contemporary librarianship–especially academic librarianship–it is difficult to remember that not all librarians welcomed the appearance of computers in libraries during the transformative era of the 1990s. Yet if we agree with Ranganathan’s most basic principles that books are for use and that librarians should save the time of the reader, why would any librarian object to new tools that help connect more users with more resources, more quickly than ever (Ranganathan, 1963)? Some, perhaps, felt threatened by the new skill sets required or the uncertainty of a transitional period. However, this paper will argue that the deeper answer points to a fundamental question of how librarians view our profession, its mission, and its role in fostering the values essential to liberal education and democracy. The technology that has enabled libraries to expand their roles has also led them to depend increasingly upon powerful commercial publishers, even as governments surrender more and more oversight to these corporate interests. Increasing consolidation of major media channels–including sources of scholarly communication–has allowed a shrinking number of corporations to control distribution and access to the materials libraries offer, through licensing fees, copyright restrictions, and digital rights management. If left unchecked, this trend threatens to stifle access to the information students need to construct knowledge, thereby undermining information literacy, critical pedagogy, and the development of those critical thinking skills so crucial to the mission of liberal education. I. Critical Pedagogy and the Threat to Liberal Education In order to understand how libraries arrived at this crossroads, it is instructive to assess the traditionally agreed upon values of libraries and liberal education, and to examine why some librarians felt those values to be under attack when technology took a larger role in libraries. Within the larger world of higher education, advocates for liberal education in the humanities argue that the critical thinking skills engendered in these fields can fortify an open society against domination by corporate or political elites. In her recently released book Why Democracy Needs the Humanities, the philosopher Martha Nussbaum argues that [a]s the critical thinking taught by the humanities is replaced by the unexamined life of the job-seekers, our ability to argue rights and wrongs is silenced. In a society of unreflective, undiscerning yes-men and yes-women, politics becomes meaner and business can invite disasters such as the economic meltdown or the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico (Allemang, 2010, p.&nbsp;…</p>

<p>Today, we observe widespread application of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>, both synchronous and asynchronous communication, by educators in many worldwide classes. Weblog (blog or web log) can be one of the instructional and integral components for ESL instructors. By applying interview and observation, this study reports on ESL students’ experience and perceptions in applying weblog throughout a semester in a writing class in Malaysia. Besides, this study examined the effect of using Weblog on students’ writing <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The findings revealed that students enjoyed the process of publishing their writings, and exchanging their experience in the weblog. Students also acknowledged weblog as a tool which provides more opportunities to publish their writing freely, extend their interaction with their peers outside the class setting, be able to publish and share interesting videos, have the chance to look for the appropriate materials in the World Wide Web (WWW) and check their sentences in the Google simultaneously. Students enjoyed some features in weblog which cannot be found in conventional modes of teaching and learning, such as experiencing unlimited time and place, more independency and freedom in publishing and exchanging comments. With the empirical data presented in this study, weblog can be applied as a suitable instructional tool to promote <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> among language learners.</p>

<p>Higher Education is the climax of the process of providing knowledge, changing learners attitude and inculcating specialized skills in individuals preparatory to taking a life-long employment with intent to earning a living and equally contributing to national economic growth and development. The Teaching and learning process is cardinal to the realization of the educational objectives of any nation. The advent of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y has made teaching and learning easier and beyond the traditional face to face interaction between the teacher and the learner. E-learning basically involving the transfer of skills and knowledge through an electronic device aims at improving the teaching/learning process. In spite of the benefits of e-learning to both regular students and distance learners, e-learning has been fraught with some challenges in Africa. Therefore, this paper discusses some of the challenges facing e-learning in Africa particularly in the Nigerian higher education system. These among others are epileptic power supply, high cost of procurement of computer hardware, inadequate infrastructure, and resistance to change on the part of the instructors, inability of learners to make use of ICT infrastructure, inadequate skilled manpower ICT, and corruption of computer storage device through viruses. Effectively managing the identified challenges means that the government would have to ensure regular power supply, lecturers and learners should be trained in the use of ICT infrastructure, and the government should evolve viable ICT policy as well as control or subsidise the price of the s of ICT infrastructure to make it affordable for both lecturers and learners.

<p>This study analyses the educational support offered through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y during formative assessment in two different cases in higher education. We analysed one blended and one virtual case from two different universities. The study aimed at identifying specific patterns of educational support intended to foster two interaction processes: (1) the promotion of greater <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the students and (2) the construction of more appropriate meanings by them. The analysis showed that these two processes were achieved with different attainment levels in each of the two study cases. Specific patterns of support mediated by technology were found underlying these different results. This led us to identify ‘suitable’ and ‘undesirable’ patterns of support in e-assessment practices.</p>

<p>Over the past years, the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> has developed communication tools as well as information resources. Text-based tools have been established as valuable modular environments for education. One of them, the MOO virtual environment, has maintained its appeal, not least through initiatives such as the CALLMOO project, which developed an educational database with a Java-based interface and undertook systematic research on educational uses of MOOs (Aarseth &amp; Jopp, 1998). In this paper, we will give a short overview of the concepts of learners <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and tandem learning.

<p>TED (Technology Entertainment Design), a collection of regularly updated talks, offers a web-based platform that is easily accessible. This platform affords language learners across multiple proficiency levels an opportunity to develop <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and critical thinking skills alongside their second language (L2) development. With an international community of TED presenters proffering diverse and progressive ideas, learners gain access to authentic language settings and valuable exposure to World Englishes. This will serve learners as they become members of an increasingly global community. By adapting literature circles into the context of blended learning, this article illustrates how such a learning platform can offer students a meaningful and interactive (language) learning experience. This article also contributes to ongoing discussions regarding technology and second language acquisition, and how these intersect to provide effective and relevant <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>–based lessons that serve the demands of L2 learners in the digital age.</p>

<p>This article explores whether the perception of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> that is promoted in language pedagogy is suitable for preparing students to perform successfully in the changed circumstances of the use of English. Recent developments, which include the growing role of English as a lingua franca and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">computer-mediated</span> communication (CMC), give rise to fluid and emergent contexts in which speakers from a variety of language and cultural backgrounds interact. It is argued that the current training-oriented view of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in ELT, with its focus on learning processes, should be amended to enable learners to cope with the challenges of communication in the twenty-first century. In this article, an approach that shifts the attention to language use is suggested, where <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is developed through tasks and activities that engage learners on their own terms and allow them to effectively exploit their linguistic resources in online negotiation of meaning.</p>

<p>This research aims to answer the question, what ways do mediated learning environments support or hinder learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>? Learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> has been identified as one important factor in the success of mediated learning environments. The central aspect of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is the control that the learner exercises over the various aspects of learning, beginning with the decision to learn or not to learn. But as Candy (1995) points out, there are several areas where learner-control can be exercised. The first are the motivational-intentional forces that drive the learner to apply some determination (or vigour) to the act of learning. They are the conative functions of learning and include learner intiative, motivation and personal involvement. They are often associated with life goals that are independent of the actual learning goals pursued within the strict confines of the learning environment (Long, 1994). The second area of learner-control is the one comprising the nuts-and-bolts of the act of learning, such as defining learning goals, deciding on a learning sequence, choosing a workable pacing of learning activities, and selecting learning resources (Hrimech &amp; Bouchard, 1998). These are the algorithmic aspects of learning, and in traditional schooling, they are the sole responsibility of the teacher. In mediated learning environments, it can be shared between the platform and the actual learner. Just a few years ago, learner control was necessarily limited to these two sets of features, conative and algorithmic. Today however, with the proliferation of educational offerings in both the private and public sector, as well as the developments in educational technology, two other aspects of the learning environment emerge as important areas where learner-control can be exercised. The semiotic dimension of learner-control includes the symbolic platforms used to convey information and meaning, for example web pages, hypertext, video/audio multimedia, animation, each of these bringing with them their own specific set of possibilities and limitations for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in learning. And then again, all learning environments exist in their own distinct economic sphere where decisions about whether, what and how to learn are made on the basis of cost-benefit, opportunity cost, and extrinsic market value. We will examine the implications of each of these areas of learner-control, and share our analysis of a series of interviews with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-learners, based on this framework of conative, algorithmic, semiotic and economic factors.</p>

<p>Rising tuition costs have forced university students to become creative in finding ways to fund their education. Some female university students have decided that ova donation may be an acceptable alternative in which to pay for their tuition. This alternative presents itself because of the insufficient number of ova available for assisted reproduction and emerging stem cell technologies. Young female university students are encouraged by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> sources and respectable electronic and print media to donate their ova in the cause of assisted reproduction for monetary compensation. While university students generally exhibit <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, the constraining influence of their financial predicament compromises the elements of informed consent (voluntariness, competence, capacity, understanding, and disclosure) as to their making an autonomous decision in regard to egg donation. Thus, any moral possibility of giving informed consent is negated. Informed consent can only occur through <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. A female university student in need of financial resources to pay for her education cannot make an autonomous choice to trade her genes for tuition. Donated ova are not only needed for assisted reproduction, but for stem cell technologies. While the long-term health of women who donate their ova is of concern (a potential risk of cancer after long term use of ovulation induction), of equal concern is the possibility of a growth in the trade of ova targeting third world and Eastern European women where the precedence for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and informed consent is not well established.</p>

<p>This study investigates the noncompulsory language learning activities performed by a group of distance EFL learners in the Turkish Open Education System. Performance of these activities has been considered as an indicator of their learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The data were collected through an online questionnaire and interviews. The study shows that in general learners do not demonstrate autonomous language learning behaviour. They prefer learning English in a relaxed environment particularly by engaging in entertaining activities, and through note-taking. However, they do not have sufficient interaction with their facilitator, other learners or speakers. Although the participants are distance learners, they do not prefer <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>-based activities. Conditions stemming from adulthood, lack of skills necessary to perform an activity, lack of awareness of some activities and learners’ experiences in their previous years of education are some of the reasons for their unautonomous behaviour. The article also includes suggestions for teaching and future research.</p>

<p>The integration of interactive <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communication</span> into different educational settings has been widely researched since the emergence of Web 2.0 technology. It has been particularly identified to give EFL students more opportunities to express ideas, enhance their engagement in learning activities and promote their confidence during virtual interactions. These benefits coincide with attributes of a learning environment that can foster learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Therefore, this paper reports on an investigation into the impacts of the employment of a web 2.0 Learning Management System (LMS) in an EFL course. Data extracted from individual interviews with four undergraduate students in a Vietnamese university was analyzed to illustrate possible effects of LMS in students’ ability to initiate, monitor and evaluate their learning process. The presentation continues with a discussion on the cyclic relationship among these three capabilities. It also addresses the local students’ perspective on socializing and academic activities as well as the relationship between them in the socio-cultural context of Vietnam. It then concludes with implications for EFL teaching practices with the adoption of LMS and puts forward suggestions for further research.</p>

This qualitative study of high school students at the conclusion of their four-play series suggests that cell phones shape the youth audience experience, that etiquette regarding the use of these powerful devices remains sharply contested, and that students apply a range of strategies to dealing with issues of power and agency around their use.</p>

<p>Research studies conducted in the area of e-learning and blended learning lead to the emergence of new concepts, which directly influence quality. Among these concepts, the ones taken into consideration for this research study are as follows: communication and collaboration, satisfaction, equity, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The perceptions of students taking blended ICT courses in a private university in Turkey were gathered through an Online Learning Environment Survey (OLES). Additionally, the suggestions of instructors for improving the quality of blended learning were obtained through a focus group interview. The findings of this study show that the perceived communication, collaboration, and satisfaction levels of students vary according to their levels of computer and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> literacy. Also, there are differences in the students’ satisfaction levels based on gender. The majority of students revealed that they considered themselves to be autonomous and equal in the blended learning environment. The findings of this research study, together with our review of recent literature, lead us to conclude that there are four major areas (containing several factors) that must be considered when developing a high-quality blended learning environment: technology, instructors, students, and pedagogy. Based on the findings, some practical suggestions for transforming traditional courses into blended ones are also offered at the end of the research study. Finally, suggestions for the future are provided.</p>

<p>This study aims to find out to what extent university students are able to develop learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> through an EAP course delivered through the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. The course, oriented to the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> resources for language learning, was designed specifically to foster learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Based on a previous exploratory study (Arno et al.&nbsp;2003), this research seeks to refine the profile of the autonomous learner initially developed and to discover which specific actions and attitudes related to learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> are found in students’ behaviour. Thus, combining qualitative and quantitative methods, we carried out an analysis of the autonomous behaviour displayed by students when using different <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> resources through activities designed to foster learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. This study has allowed us to outline the profile of autonomous learners in a virtual classroom, with students who are able to take the initiative and make decisions on the organization and management of their learning process. Focusing on the connection between making the most of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and developing students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, our ultimate aim is to point to ways in which students may be encouraged to become more autonomous and explore the role that the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> may play in helping us attain this objective.</p>

<p>Japanese distance education has been slow to utilize the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, and mainly depends on the mail system and to a lesser extent TV broadcasting as its mode of delivery. However, since 2001 regulations have been relaxed to allow students to complete all course requirements for a university degree via online distance learning. This paper reports the results of a questionnaire study administered to the students (N=424) enrolled in one of Japan’s few online distance universities. Satisfaction with learning was explored by examining student opinions and learning preferences in regard to five aspects of distance learning identified as important: 1) teacher interaction, 2) content interaction, 3) student interaction, 4) computer interaction and 5) student <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. In addition, student responses to three open-ended questions were included in the analysis. The results indicated students were generally satisfied with their learning, and that specifically, learning satisfaction was higher for students who: 1) could persevere in the face of distance learning challenges, 2) found computers easy to use, 3) found it easy to interact with instructors, and 4) did not prefer social interaction with others when learning.</p>

<p>Learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> has been a recent trend in education which highlights the students’ engagement in their own learning. Although over the past 30 years, a large body of research has been carried on learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, limited attention has been paid to the sense teachers in comparison to learners would make of this concept. The present study is an attempt to shed light on the general existing pattern of the way teachers and learners view learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. To do so, applying the convenience method of sampling, a structured questionnaire consisting of five sections was <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>ed to most of the teachers teaching English as a foreign language in Isfahan, Iran. In order to have a more precise analysis, an interview was carried out to see what reasons are behind the participants’ answers. Employing the referential statistics, the results indicated that nearly all the teachers and learners agreed on the fact that learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> allows language learners to learn more efficiently than they otherwise would. Furthermore, in relation to desirability and feasibility of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, almost all the participants agreed that it is more desirable than feasible. The findings of this study might benefit those teachers and institution officials interested in enhancing learning <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> among their students and even educating themselves or the other teachers to make use of it practically in classrooms.</p>

<p>This article reports on an action research project that took place as part of two regular and compulsory courses in the 3 rd year of English Studies at Alcala University, developed in the Blackboard learning system, that is, a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">computer-mediated</span> format. The steps of the project were the following: Firstly, the integration of computerized tools in the curriculum of the two university subjects. Secondly, the implementation of this learning experience was based on a corpus of selected texts which were annotated to help and guide students in their work (the World of Texts); and a database used by students to deal with lexical analysis and to record their findings and their knowledge about lexical items from the texts compiled (the Web of Words). By integrating ICT in the teaching process, we expected to foster students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and motivation as well as to improve their lexical and semantic competence. The research results suggest that, in the first place, the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">computer-mediated</span> format increased students’ motivation and encouraged <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the learning process; in addition, it contributed to a better understanding of both subjects.</p>

<p>This paper discusses the findings of two case studies (two primary schools in Singapore), which are part of a larger research study, that aims to examine and analyze where and how <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICTs) are integrated in Singapore schools to engage students in higher order thinking activities. For students to engage in higher order thinking, they first need to have <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> over their learning processes. The focus of the paper is on how orienting activities support learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the ICT-based learning environment. Taking the activity system as a unit of analysis, the study documents the actual processes by which orienting activities are planned and organized to support learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in their contexts.</p>
<p>By employing methods such as observations, focus group discussions with students, and face-to-face interviews with teachers, an account of how the activity systems within and between classrooms, and the schools are generated. The account identifies and describes five categories of orienting activities: introductory sessions to ICT tools, advance organizers and instructional objectives, worksheets and checklists, dialogues among participants, and tools for post-instructional reflection. It also highlights the constraints of time and lack of knowledge and experience in the contexts that the teachers are working under, and how these constraints are addressed.</p>

<p>In this paper, E. Esch and C. Zahner argue that the learners themselves are the key agents in the construction of new language learning environments. Learners differ in their ability to import new elements – such as ICTs – into their model of what constitutes an appropriate language learning environment. It is argued that accessibility, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, ‘reflectivity’ and interactivity are conditions which must be met if ICTs are to become truly relevant to language learners. The way these principles have been guiding the development of the network-based language learning environment installed by the Language Centre of the University of Cambridge is described.</p>

<p>The integration of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICT) in course offerings in institutions of higher learning (IHLs) is the catalyst towards empowering learners to become autonomous lifelong learners. In an effort to produce quality and independent learners, Learning Management Systems (LMS) are seen as a means to assist educators in developing quality online <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> based courses and websites as well as to fulfil students’ needs in acquiring information anywhere and anytime. This paper explores the Malaysian perspective in addressing issues and challenges faced by adult learners in IHLs to keep abreast with this latest trend. This research paper is based on a pilot study that investigated learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> via a distance learning programme in a local university in Malaysia. Initial findings indicated that first-year students lacked the confidence needed to learn autonomously. Even though they showed some confidence in planning, results indicated they needed help in organising, monitoring and evaluating their learning. If students are required to participate in asynchronous online learning, necessary steps have to be taken to ensure they are empowered with the necessary skills and tools to help them manage their own learning for their journey to become lifelong autonomous learners.</p>

<p>Kony 2012, a film released by the nonprofit Invisible Children in the spring of 2012, drew a flurry of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> “shares” and “likes.” However, critics expressed a concern that the film offered a distorted portrayal of Africans and African politics. In this article, we test these criticisms by asking what effects the film had on college students’ perceptions of Africa and Africans. To address this question, we draw on a survey and an experiment conducted at a small liberal arts college where Kony 2012 enjoyed popularity. The results show that the film did affect students’ perceptions of Africa; specifically, it led many to perceive Africans as lacking agency and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. We argue that whereas the film did have initial negative effects on students’ perceptions of Africa, these effects seem to fade over time. Future research should explore the compounding effects of exposure to images that misrepresent the African continent.</p>

<p>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s iLab project has developed a distributed software toolkit and middleware service infrastructure to support <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>-accessible laboratories and promote their sharing among schools and universities on a worldwide scale. The project starts with the assumption that the faculty teaching with online labs and the faculty or academic departments that provide those labs are acting in two roles with different goals and concerns. The iLab architecture focuses on fast platform-independent lab development, scalable access for students, and efficient management for lab providers while preserving the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the faculty actually teaching the students. Over the past two years, the iLab architecture has been adopted by an increasing number of partner universities in Europe, Australia, Africa, Asia, and the United States. The iLab project has demonstrated that online laboratory use can scale to thousands of students dispersed on several continents.</p>

<p>Abstract This study examined the factors affecting the sexual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of female university students to provide thebasic data for developing an intervention program for sex education. The data was collected from 322 female collegestudents and analyzed with a t-test and multiple regression using the SPSS 21.0 program. The significant factors of sexual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> were intercourse experience (β=0.115, p=.040), sex knowledge (β=0.118, p=.028), permissiveness ofsexual violence (β=-0.290, p&lt;.001), and the perception of unwed pregnancy (β=-0.104, p=.048). These factors explained 21.7% of the variance in sexual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. In conclusion, there is a need to develop a sex education program to increase sexual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> considering the factors affecting sexual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.

<p>The demand of responsibilities among teachers has evolved not only in classroom management but also to the extent of promoting communication and interpersonal skills. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social media</span> is integrated in schools and higher learning institutions for communication and reflection of learning which enhance teachers’ performance in leadership quality and effective teaching. This study was designed in a qualitative approach mainly to explore the extent of interest and enjoyment students experienced during an intensive ICT course. Blog was used as a medium for reflection during the class where students posted their creations of videos, posters and other ICT materials. The three needs investigated were namely <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness support. The researcher further examined on students’ awareness of the usefulness of the ICT skill they learned and how much they can use the blog for teaching and learning. Based on the Basic Psychological Needs Theory framework (BPNT), this study has adopted the direct observation, journal entry, and interviews as a triangulation approach.</p>

<p>The purpose of this study was to identify the effects of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> filtering and restricted <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> access in a school system and its effects on teaching and learning. A total of 120 middle and high school teachers and support and administrative staff completed a questionnaire with 14 Likert-type items and one openended response question about their perceptions of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> filtering in their school. A chi-square test between middle and high school respondents revealed no significant differences. The majority (N=87) reported they accessed the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> on a daily basis. Nearly all agreed that technology support was available (N=118), but 117 respondents felt legitimate sites had been blocked. Although user agreements were in place, results indicated that some felt students were not always punished for downloading offensive material. Some admitted they themselves used techniques to get around the filter or block to complete their tasks. A majority of the respondents reported e-mail as a critical function. Most felt the restrictions imposed in this county school system were designed to be more of a ban on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> access. Teachers who used the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> to develop lesson plans must show how the web sites will be used to support the lesson, and get approval to access the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. Sites must be bookmarked for the students’ use, and teachers are responsible for students accessing only those pre-approved sites. Frequent comments regarded the “filtering” system as essentially a block that: hampered their duties, created an inconvenience, reduced student <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, lowered morale, and decreased the likelihood they would create lessons integrating</p>

<p>This research includes both a descriptive and an exploratory study of seventeen library and information science (LIS) education academic units or programs that have been involved in mergers or administrative realignments that have positioned them in new organizational homes between the years 1982-2001. These LIS schools have been subject to a process that has moved them, willingly or not, from a status of relative independence and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (and in many cases, cultural isolation), to that of partners in new alliances, or protected adoptees in new administrative and organizational homes. The authors wished to discover what took place, and learn of the conditions surrounding the merger or repositioning of the schools. We also wished to explore why these changes were implemented and to learn as much as possible about the outcomes of these developments. For the descriptive part of the study we relied on available documentation, often online, and telephone interviews with key participants in the mergers. Deans, directors, and senior faculty members were selected as a purposive sample for the exploratory, qualitative part of this study. A questionnaire consisting of twenty-three, mostly open-ended, questions was administered in telephone interviews. A follow-up brief questionnaire on specific outcomes was administered by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> to the participants in the study. What we learned about the rationales, responses to, and outcomes of these mergers and realignments is reported here. While such mergers and relocations have been successful so far as survival strategies, many of the anticipated benefits have yet to be realized.</p>

<p>The aim of this paper, is to give a overview of the real situation of the use of new technologies in teaching process of Italian language in the southern region of Albania. The development of information technologies is already influencing all spheres of human life. Nowadays, computers are used in learning and teaching foreign languages, as well as the education of other disciplines. The new technologies help students go into an active learning process. When it is thought in terms of the learner, it provides learning <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for the person. The learner can reach a linguistic competence in a shorter time by reaching several visual and auditory texts in foreign language, increasing his/her vocabulary knowledge, doing very productive grammar exercises in an interactively way, seeing the pronunciation of a word and the usage of it in a sentence, benefiting from translating programs, finding a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> friend to improve his/her communication ability, reaching the academic journals in the libraries ,reading and listening to the news in foreign language. In the Southern region of Albania this process has not been completely successful. DOI: 10.5901/mjss.2015.v6n6s2p93</p>

<p>Recently, the way languages are learned has been greatly influenced by technology. Both learners and professors are exposed to the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> daily, so they can take advantage of it to teach and learn a foreign language. For this reason, it has become necessary to find ways to blend technology with language instruction.

Document management is regarded as an administrative practice allowing the Ministry to inculcate bureaucratic values and an ethos of serving the government in professor, making them renounce their administrative <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.Being engaged in bureaucratic re-arrangement of reality, Russian professors very soon embarked on paperwork, which boosted the document flow in universities. The large scale of this behavior model indicates that a new type of university culture was born. Bureaucratic management of universities in the Russian Empire was different from that in Western countries in that it aimed to make the document flow uniform with other public institutions and to develop uniform rules and formal language. As a result, professors gradually lost the opportunity to express their own opinions and to take initiative in communicating with the government. The authors emphasize the subordinate nature of activities performed by professors to satisfy relevant governmental demands, which suggested that professors assisted in opening new schools, controlled existing ones, eradicated prejudice, obtained primary data on imperial regions and resources (topographic, meteorological, ethnographic, and economic data), and disseminated Western scientific ideas and knowledge in regional culture. An analysis of document management in Russian universities of the first half of the 19th century has shown that they were part of the administrative structure at that time, which diminished their status significantly, as compared to Western universities.</p>

<p>The advent of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s has had dramatic influences on our daily lives and has rendered human beings ‘walking computers’. This holds important reflections in the realm of language learning, as well as in many other areas. This study aimed to explore the extent to which English Language Teaching (ELT) students utilise <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s for language learning purposes. To this end, a 25-item questionnaire was administered to 120 Grade Three and Four ELT students at Ondokuz Mayis University in Turkey. Following the questionnaire, a follow-up oral interview was conducted with 29 of the participants on a voluntary basis in order to further investigate their perceptions of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s. The statistical analysis of the participants’ responses to the items in the questionnaire clearly shows that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s are actively used for language learning purposes. In particular, their contribution to the development of vocabulary skills is frequently reported, which is also verified by the answers given during the interview. The analysis regarding the ‘gender’ and ‘length of the students’ possession of a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>’ variables does not yield any statistically significant effect on the degree to which students utilise <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s for language learning purposes. Given the fact that almost all students have a personal <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>, and use it very often, and considering the findings of this study, it is suggested that students be encouraged to utilise the invaluable language learning opportunities offered by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s when put to conscious use.

<p>The findings obtained from the study and research into the consequences of applying determined teaching styles has led to a growing interest in this area among the scientific community. The student-centered and constructivist learning environments which enable students to gain a significant understanding through their own efforts has grown in importance compared with the traditional learning environment based on the transfer of learning by teachers (Oguz, 2013). In the context of the constructivist approach, students create their own knowledge by actively participating in the learning process (Wang, 2011), and by giving importance to the learners’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. In these environments of interaction, the teacher becomes the learning facilitator, planning tasks and supporting responsibility for learning (Koc, 2006), providing students with options, helping them make their own decisions and solve problems for themselves. Consequently, this new focus provides students with opportunities to ask their own questions, and create their own learning concepts and strategies based on existing knowledge. The teacher has to accept students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and their enterprising spirit, and support them in this sense. In the context of this constructivist focus, one of the the main objectives of education is to promote students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (Ozturk, 2011).

<p>Introduction Several authors discuss the use of digital games as effective learning tools. Aguilera and Mendiz (2003) and Gee (2003) bring extensive discussions–and seminal works–on the topic, as Bransford et al.&nbsp;(2000) and Prensky (2001) have done before. The role of digital games in these processes is being explored in the scientific literature for some time already, as evidenced by the work of Squire (2002). All these authors discuss computer games, as possessors of an attractive addition with strong appeal to motivate children and adults, could amplify the power of exploration and imagination of students, providing moments of research, reflection and learning. Nowadays, more recent discussions bring to light the need for narrative games and applications directed to specific areas such as education in Health Sciences (Tashiro, 2009), Engineering (Mayo, 2007) and Computer Sciences (Mustaro, Silva, &amp; Silveira, 2008), for instance. Studies on contemporary culture, such as Johnson (2005), lead to the need to address further and specifically on the impact of the games in the education of a young of digital natives appropriating the term coined by Prensky (2001). Tapscott (1998) uses the nomenclature net generation to describe this generation, characterized by a high degree of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, intellectual openness, inclusion, technology, freedom of expression, curiosity, short-termism and especially confidence. Shaffer (2007) highlights the use of computer games as effective for children’s learning, while Prensky (2007) presents a broader approach, examining the impact of digital games in educational processes in general. Mustaro et al.&nbsp;(2008) argue that this scenario fully justifies even andragogical proposals focused on games, since it is possible to take advantage of nowadays’ technological culture to subsidize the construction of learning resources for both formal education and for situations of non-formal learning, for both digital natives and older students that are immersed into (or are strongly influenced by) a culture with a pervasive presence of technology. The main point behind all these works could be resumed as: the content carried both in formal and non-formal education present some structural problems. Some of them are listed below: * Content (usually in formal education) have a degree of abstraction that often prevents efficient learning when teaching strategies are used that put students under the condition of passive learners. * Some learning situations require students to spend huge mental efforts to memorize large amount of information and procedures. This situation occurs equally in formal and non-formal education, being more common in certain knowledge fields than others. * Presentation of the content in face-to-face education sometime lacks from real-world examples of application of such content. This is more usual in theoretical subjects than hands-on ones. * Even in practical learning situations, the subject being taught could carry a very high complexity, given the amount of variables involved in real-world experiences. Physics labs and field experiences are good examples of it. These are situations where real conditions do not help the learning process–the world could be not so real in these cases. In all these contexts, the application of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies (ICTs) in learning and teaching situations could allow new perspectives on various aspects ranging from content organization to a wide range of new opportunities promoted by the effective incorporation of technology into the entire teaching-learning process. At this point, the concept of Learning Objects (Wiley, 2000) is fundamental for the development of digital educational resources for use both in experimental and large-scale projects involving a massive number of students and disciplines in formal education. …</p>

<p>The use of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>y (ICT) especially the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> has been a common practice in education. However, research studies show that the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> has not been frequently used in the teaching of English as a foreign language (EFL) writing, especially in the Indonesian context. This study aimed to find out whether or not Indonesian EFL teachers are familiar with the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>-based techniques for the teaching of writing. In addition, it investigated their opinions on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>-based techniques of teaching of writing. This study involved 17 EFL teachers from various parts of the country who were asked about their experiences and opinions dealing with the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>-based teaching of writing. The results of the study showed that almost half of the teachers admitted that they have used <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> facilities for the teaching of writing. The other EFL teachers either have indirect involvement with the teaching of writing using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> application or have never used <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> applications at all. However, these teachers had intention to teach writing by applying <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>-based techniques for their future practices. The study also showed that Indonesian EFL teachers valued the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>-based teaching of writing as this practice benefits the students in terms of their writing quality and quantity, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, flexibility, as well as confidence. This implies that with the development of advanced ICT, there is a hope that students’ learning of writing could be improved well.</p>

<p>What has really happened in the Italian schools in the last few years? One of the main issues for the Italian school is to answer a series of seemingly simple questions: what is the improvement in the performance of students and teachers brought about by these reforms? Do these reforms contribute to improve the students’ learning abilities? Do these reforms make the school better? The objective of the contribution is to closely examine the effects of the school reforms ten years after the beginning of the <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> season, by focusing on the daily practices performed by many Italian schools.

<p>Since digital inequality among schoolchildren may exacerbate the existing rural-urban disparity, determining how to reduce rural-urban digital inequality among students remains an important policy issue. This study uses a unique and nationally representative dataset of 1953 elementary and junior high school students in Taiwan to examine the extent to which students’ characteristics, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of use, family background and resource inputs may be associated with the digital self-efficacy of schoolchildren. The Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition method was applied to further investigate the relative contributions the observed characteristics made to the rural-urban digital inequality of schoolchildren. The results show that the observed differences in factors associated with students’ digital self-efficacy account for 35% of rural-urban digital inequality. Furthermore, the number of computers in homes and schools, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> connectivity at home, mothers’ educational level, and the number of weekly computer classes provided by the school play a significant role with regard to the digital inequality between rural and urban students. We examine digital divide of students between rural and urban areas in Taiwan.The Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition method was utilized.Differences in observed characteristics account for 35% of the digital divide.To increase computer availability can reduce digital divide of students.</p>

My contention is that educational technology, more specifically using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>, can engender pedagogical action amongst learners and educators that resonates with democratic practices. In other words, using educational technology in science and teacher education can enhance learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and equality, so that critical, self-reflexive thinking and disruptive thought and action respectively can be cultivated through technology-assisted education.

<p>The central role of evaluation, institutional assessment and quality assurance processes of schools and universities in education policy is object of discussion also considering the reform of the state. New Public Management theories and managerialist perspectives are considered some of the main sources of inspiration and legitimation in the dominant context of an audit education. Preliminary empirical data from external assessment of Portuguese primary and secondary schools are introduced and interpreted according to the main concepts and organizational representations of school found in external reports. Examining some of the central organizational images and meanings of school, school culture, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, goals, leadership and effectiveness included in the external reviews, the author stresses the importance of formal, rational and bureaucratic images of schools. Several new research questions are presented for further inquiry based on the hypothesis of what it is called by the author the process of hyperbureaucratization of educational organizations. Some of the main dimensions of the concept of bureaucracy as presented by Max Weber are revisited in close relation with neo-scientific approaches of quality assurance and taking in consideration the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies. Accordingly the author suggests that much more importance must be given to formal and rational models of interpreting educational organizations because assessment and quality assurance procedures are contributing to the formalization of schools and universities and to the intensification of their process of rationalization, i. e., to the emergence of an analytic image of schools as hyperbureaucracies.</p>

<p>The study used Explanatory Sequential Design (ESD) of Mixed-Methods to investigate college students’ and instructors’ perspectives of constructivist learning environment (CLE). Students, including graduates and undergraduates from a Midwestern university, rated their preference for personal relevance, collaboration, negotiation, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> as key learning experiences embodied in CLE. Results indicated that undergraduates were more likely than graduate students to prefer collaboration and negotiation experiences. Expanding on the results of students’ quantitative ratings, students’ and instructors’ perspectives of collaboration were explored. Eight participants (four students and four instructors) participated in one-on-one interview sessions. Themes that emerged from the qualitative analysis showed that the differences in students’ preference for collaboration related to students’ perceptions of unequal opportunities to collaborate, perceived benefits, and diverse backgrounds and orientations. In addition, conditions necessary for effective collaboration in the college environment were explored. Thematic analysis produced three themes: understanding collaboration process; monitoring, assessment, and evaluation system; and group composition. Implications for practice in the college classroom have been discussed.</p>

<p>This article reports on a study of classroom environments in emerging <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> classrooms in British Columbia, Canada. The study involved an evaluation of the physical and psychosocial learning environments in these settings through a combination of case studies and questionnaires. This work focuses on the results obtained from the administration of a student questionnaire designed to measure aspects of the psychosocial learning environment in these settings and to relate these factors to students’ satisfaction with learning and to other physical aspects of the learning environment. Versions of the What Is Happening in This Classroom (WIHIC) instrument and Computerized Classroom Environment Checklist (CCEC) were administered to 358 high school students in 22 classrooms from six schools around the province. Analysis of classroom environment data revealed that student <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>/independence and task orientation are associated with students’ satisfaction with learning. Relating data to physical measures such as the workspace and visual environments demonstrated significant associations between the physical and psychosocial learning environment in technology-rich classrooms. Further qualitative data suggest that factors related to teaching styles, classroom design, and the learning environment interact to influence students’ satisfaction with learning.</p>

<p>The recent state-of-the-art networking technology has made the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> a vital medium to promote effective communication and education in language learning and teaching. Universities and schools have been reinforcing traditional classroom-based instructions with online learning management systems. Students can be benefited through the more frequent online interaction with the teacher for their independent learning outside the classroom. This paper explains what the multimedia-assisted language instruction means in English education in college classrooms and then examines how teachers can help students develop learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and classroom interaction using Moodle, an open source learning management system. Students of this study responded that English language materials provided through this multimedia-assisted instruction were very effective and that they felt doing class activities through online was very convenient because they could control their own learning according to their pace and situations. While sharing common interests and ideas about studying English or life events, they could study in interactive and collaborative ways. Students also answered that they could study voluntarily and more through these online learning activities.</p>

The discussion bellow will concern about some <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> links that can be used for speaking study. The learners can study by using these <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> links independently and record their own voice and video for their own self- assessment.

<p>Education is in a state of rapid change. The influx of new <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICTs) lead us to question: “How do we find the balance between continuity and discontinuity whilst critically renewing our educational traditions?” The paper develops a philosophical understanding that transcends utopian and dystopian claims that IT is either “becoming education” or “destroying the essence of education,” respectively. This philosophical perspective is developed around: (1) the question of student <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and the potential of its being undermined through ICT and (2) the processes through which students can potentially resist these threats. The paper develops and applies the philosophical understanding to the question of student <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. First, the paper emphasizes the importance of considering student <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the debates around the relationship of ICT and education. Second, the paper proposes a conceptual model of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, drawing upon some important ideas of Habermas and pragmatist thinking. Third, the paper identifies some systemic threats on educational processes arising from globalization and corporatization. Fourth, I outline the Habermasian response to these threats as a means to understand the nature of student response. Finally, drawing upon the conceptual ideas of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> presented, I consider five specific approaches to examine the question of the reform of MIS education.</p>

It has been demonstrated that the accumulated educational lag had been eliminated actively during the two decades preceding the World War I by establishing new universities and professional educational institutions and by creating a series of private universities in addition to the system of governmental ones.In the dawn of capitalism, higher education was on the rise in Russia. There were ever more professors, and the number of students had increased almost ten times by that time. There also was an increase in social value of university graduates’ labor. The academic degree system was pretty close to that of Western Europe (Master and Doctor degrees), while requirements for candidates were much higher in Russia than abroad. As a professional group, university intelligentsia played a prominent role in social, economic, political, and cultural life of the pre-revolutionary Russia. In the dialogue with the government and the society, the university association defended the principles of university <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, which, at the time, was limited by bureaucracy and total control of the Ministry of National Education.The Soviet Union put an end to the progressive development of higher schools in Russia. The existing higher education system was fully destroyed, while university intelligentsia, as a social and professional group bearing educational culture and university traditions, was virtually obliterated in the epoch of revolutionary terror and political repressions.</p>

<p>This study examines teachers’ perceptions and comprehension of their school community support for change in implementing a new teaching approach in science and technology in the context of a reform initiative at the secondary level. It is part of a two-year research-intervention conducted with science teachers from a private school. Data was first collected through ethnographic notes and audio-recorded focus groups with 256 students. Although appreciated by students, the implementation provoked conflicts at the school community level. Building on the Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (<span style="background-color:lightgreen">CHAT</span>) and on the expansive learning cycle aiming at transforming an activity system, the actual study aims at deepening our understanding of the origins of contradictions at and between some of the poles of multileveled activity system that is object-oriented, mediated by artefacts (instruments), and comprises the community, rules and division of labor poles. Findings highlight the clash in the participant teachers’ values versus the community’s in implementing innovative teaching practice. Teachers report favoring nontraditional ways of teaching and giving more room to adolescents’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> while the stakeholders (school principal, parents) are often looking for traditional teaching practices and students’ school achievement. The results put into evidence the need to identify common grounds and to make sense of the new science teaching approach aiming at promoting students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, critical judgment, and school success levels.</p>

<p>Project-based learning is a widely used pedagogical strategy in engineering education shown to be effective in fostering problem-solving, design, and teamwork skills. There are distinct benefits to be gained from giving students <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in determining the nature and scope of the projects that they wish to undertake, but a lack of expert guidance and of a clear direction at the outset can result in confusion, frustration, and unfulfilled goals. Moreover, engineering schools face the imperative of providing students with opportunities to engage with industry during their courses, which can be difficult to accomplish due to logistical and time constraints. This paper reports on a case study in which undergraduate students of electrical, computer, me<span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>ronics, and telecommunications engineering interacted with representatives from industry to obtain feedback at the inception phase of their design projects. Students pitched their ideas to the industry guests at a virtual “trade fair” held within a hybrid video conferencing and three-dimensional (3-D) virtual world environment, in preparation for the assessable pitches that they had to deliver on campus to a faculty audience. Survey and assessment results attest to the participants’ satisfaction as well as to the effectiveness of the approach in improving student self-efficacy and performance. The paper concludes with recommendations for engineering educators looking to implement similar initiatives and a brief outline of the authors’ plans for the future.</p>

<p>With the further promotion of new curriculum reform,children’s freedom,<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>,rights,and happiness are increasingly emphasized by people who are also growingly suspicious of teacher’s manipulating of classroom teaching.From the perspective of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netics,classroom manipulation is characterized by student-based domain,two-way communication,unexpected outcome,and intangible functions of self-organization,which is conducive to maintaining the optimal state of teaching system,helping allocate various elements,and catalyzing self-organization.Therefore,classroom manipulation is not the hindrance to students’ autonomous learning,nor the internal factors resulting in teacher’s powerfulness and teaching fossilization.</p>

<p>In EFL classrooms,teachers have gradually adopted the CLT approach focusing on meaning and language use,due to the linier feature of face-to-face interaction,the learning outcome is still not efficient enough.EFL teachers now urgently need a solution to increase exposure and use of the target knowledge both inside and outside of the classroom.This paper assumes that the integration of CMC(Computer Mediated Communication) into EFL learning can provide learners with more authentic input and more opportunities to participate in the target sociocultural contexts;both linguistic and pragmatic knowledge can be promoted.Moreover,motivation,learners’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and equal opportunities for output can also be encouraged through the use of CMC inside and outside of the classroom.</p>

<p>Introduction. The ToLigado Project Your School Interactive Newspaper is an interactive virtual learning environment conceived, developed, implemented and supported by researchers at the School of the Future Research Laboratory of the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Method. This virtual learning environment aims to motivate trans-disciplinary research among public school students and teachers in 2,931 schools equipped with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>-access computer rooms. Within this virtual community, students produce collective multimedia research documents that are immediately published in the portal. The project also aims to increase students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for research, collaborative work and Web authorship. Main sections of the portal are presented and described. Results. Partial results of the first two years’ implementation are presented and indicate a strong motivation among students to produce knowledge despite the fragile hardware and software infrastructure at the time. Discussion. In this new environment, students should be seen as ‘knowledge architects’ and teachers as facilitators, or ‘curiosity managers’. The ToLigado portal may constitute a repository for future studies regarding student attitudes in virtual learning environments, students’ behaviour as ‘authors’, Web authorship involving collective knowledge production, teachers’ behaviour as facilitators, and virtual learning environments as digital repositories of students’ knowledge construction and social capital in virtual learning communities.

<p>Prior research shows that students use the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> as a main source of health information. When starting college, students get greater <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> over their behaviors and responsibility for their own health, which creates a number of health-related information needs. As a result of this newly acquired <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, students also frequently engage in various risky behaviors, putting their well-being in jeopardy. This study aimed to answer whether the self-reported frequency in which students engage in risky behaviors and their enrollment in health-related courses affect how frequently they obtain health-related information. A novel aspect of this study is that it incorporated both intentional and opportunistic information acquisition. An analysis of online survey responses from 810 undergraduates attending a mid-western U.S. university showed that the frequency of their engagement in risky behaviors (e.g., the use of substances and alcohol and engagement in high-risk sexual activities) is not significantly associated with the frequency of neither intentional nor opportunistic health information acquisition on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. However, students enrolled in health-related courses more frequently obtain health information by both intentional search and opportunistic discovery. This opportunistic style of was often described in the literature using terms such as passive, unintentional, accidental, serendipitous, encountering or acquiring by chance. The study findings provide valuable directions for librarians and health educators on how to design new and improve existing e-health literacy instructions to better suit students’ current needs and information behavior patterns.</p>

<p>Changes in the German medical licensing law in 2002 demanded the inclusion of sound scientific knowledge and practical skills in the medical education programme for undergraduates. The universities were given ample <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to implement this goal, so that subjects not yet included in the curricula, such as Evidence-based Medicine (EbM), could now be integrated in the study course. Hence, in 2003 the Medical Faculty of the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, Frankfurt/Germany implemented (as first institution) a mandatory clinical training in EbM for third-year medical students. The content and structure of the seminar are based on the “Curriculum EbM” of the German Network of Evidence-Based Medicine. This project is conducted exclusively by intern medical students with previous training in teaching skills and specific knowledge. The seminar is integrated in the interdisciplinary field “Epidemiology, biostatistics, and informatics”. The four-day seminars consist of lectures and small-group teaching based on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> search of medical information as well as on the critical appraisal of studies that deal with therapeutic and diagnostic problems; the self-evaluation of the information-retrieval process is also included. Special importance is attached to the need of scrutinising published medical information. The grades are based on seminar-oriented tests as well as on end-of-term examinations. The Frankfurt project shows that EbM can be easily implemented in medical undergraduate courses.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> in learning is about people taking more control over their learning in the classrooms, the purpose of learn languages and the ways in which they learn them. In this way, technology helps much in learning a language. This paper explores the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> as more than preference or strategy by the learner; it must be supported in a systematic way by the teacher and the curriculum for the learner to benefit. The characteristics of successful autonomous learner are explained followed by some examples that shown that learners have in common are that their attitudes were developed after they made their own decision for themselves that exclusively studying in the classroom environment was not enough. The paper also emphasis on technology approaches in developing learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, especially by using the computer and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>. Newer technology, particularly the latest online systems, however, allows sound, movement, interactivity (for exercises, demonstrations, online discussion, etc), and the incorporation of genuine material for learning.

<p>With the development of computer and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> technology, web-based autonomous learning is increasingly becoming an essential element in the learning process for college students. Web-based autonomous learning, based on humanism and constructivism, has combined autonomous learning and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> technology, and opened up a new path to college English learning. Mastering English is even more important for engineering students whose native language is not English, as many engineering graduates encounter difficulties in their English-related work. Most scientific papers or journals globally are written in English. Most engineering graphs are also marked in English. To prepare engineering students for their future careers and life-long study, research is conducted in this paper to investigate the current situation of web-based autonomous English learning of engineering students in particular and current problems in their process of learning. Based on research findings, possible solutions and suggestions are proposed to solve the problems and improve students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in English learning.</p>

<p>We report on a study on the ways leading teachers in secondary schools use <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networks while interacting with their students. We undertook in-depth interviews with five leading teachers, and analyzed logs of interactions in order to identify teaching practices combining social networks. One teacher considerably strengthened her traditional teaching practices to control students according to a pedagogical approach of transmission of knowledge. We found that four teachers fostered social learning, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and active engagement among their students. They thereby fostered the constitution of a learning community - of inquiry, or a moral community, through the use of social network site</span>s. Additionally, we identified the distinctive role of social networks in contributing to the students’ learning to be part of their community. We examined five Israeli leading teachers who use social networks in their classes.Four teachers were found to foster social learning, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and active learning.The fifth teacher used FB to strengthen traditional teaching practices.SNSs help students learning to be members of communities for better or for worse.With SNSs, leading teachers become potential agents of educational change.</p>

<p>This study involving 252 students from four different higher educational institutions in China investigates the attitudes and practices towards learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> with the use of technology in learning English. Questionnaires were distributed to the 252 participants and follow-up in-depth interviews were undertaken with a number of participants. Meanwhile, the teacher as a researcher conducted the action research project in order to understand how the use of modern technology and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> enhanced English proficiency of learners, especially their listening and speaking abilities. Additionally, some invaluable data were collected from interviews with participants and learning diaries on their experiences in using advanced technology. The research results demonstrate that: 1) One of the most important roles for language teachers is to motivate students to learn English, and to teach them correct learning strategies and learning methods; 2) Learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> plays a crucial role in learning English; 3) The combination of the use of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and advanced technology, such as computers and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, helps learners improve their English language proficiency, and is considered to be one of the most effective ways to learn a language.

<p>Efforts in quality improvement and development of education in the era of regional <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> are not only the responsibility of the central government and provincial governments, but also the responsibility of local governments. Quality improvement and development of education thus become strategic issues for any local government. This study aims to address issues related to: (1) the condition of school facilities and infrastructure (2) the role of school committees which is not optimal; (3) the absence of equitable distribution of teachers; and (4) the lack of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>y/ICT-based learning application in in secondary schools. The research was conducted in four districts, namely Bangkalan, Sampang, Pamekasan and Sumenep. The main theory employed in this study is the School Based Management (SBM) or the so-called School Based Management (SBM). The population was students, parents and teachers. The total number of samples was 250 people comprising 100 students, 100 parents and 50 teachers. The research data were obtained from primary and secondary data. The study yielded a number of key findings. First, 90% of High School (or its equivalent) teachers master the materials taught. This is due to fact that the materials taught are in accordance with the education qualification of the teacher. Secondly, the mismatch found in Madurese high schools was apparently caused by the lack of educators with suitable qualification for the subjects they teach concurrently. Almost all secondary teachers in Madura island require trainings related to the development of competency for mastering the subject materials. The last but not the least, the majority of teachers still apply simple learning methods. Although the method applied by teachers are generally similar, there are significant differences between the favorite schools and the other schools.</p>

Nineteen Spanish and seventeen Finnish participants were provided with the opportunity to interact with each other outside the classroom with a view to exploring the target culture and, consequently, experiencing intercultural learning. The findings suggest that the learning experience was positive and that the participants felt motivated to examine each other’s cultural traits and manage their own learning tasks. Sharing information and reciprocally exchanging views on comments are paramount in developing skills to become independent learners.</p>

<p>The paper analyzes the effects that occur in the process of the educational environment informatization. The following effects were analyzed: information richness, openness, individualization of learning and collaboration. Examples of educational practice, illustrating the significant changes of the university educational environment associated with the manifestation of these effects, are presented. The aim of the pilot study carried out in Herzen University was to identify the attitude to the listed effects of teachers and students who are using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y in the educational interactions. The leading method of study were a series of surveys addressed to teachers and students. Groups of questions were related to basic information effects, manifested in the educational environment of the university. The total number of the survey participants is 200 students (bachelors and masters) and 100 teachers, most actively using electronic environment for research, education and professional activities. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the results showed that information richness, spatial and temporal freedom of educational interactions are demanded by students, but at the same time, the data indicated a lack of systematic pedagogical support for the information and educational activities of students. A large part of students show a high <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the information educational environment, but also demands implementing individualized information and communication educational request. Students and teachers are actively using a variety of information and communication opportunities of the electronic environment, but students’ activeness in the electronic environment is largely determined by the recommendations of teachers, rather than by a free choice of educational opportunities. The participants of the educational environment acquire a significant degree of freedom in relation to the time and place of interaction with educational resources, but evidence suggests that educational activities in the electronic environment is not sufficiently focused on expanding the range of educational opportunities and preparing students for continual self-improvement of knowledge and skills. As the conclusions, we note the need to improve both the corporate strategy of the university electronic environment development and the competences of educational interactions in the extended information and communication space. This will reveal the full potential of e-learning environment and provide greater guarantees for obtaining high-quality educational outcomes. For teachers are in demand special competences, providing the possibility of forming a diverse and adaptive media environment for saturated solution of educational problems in accordance with university policies, introduction of e-learning and global education trends. For students, come to the fore the competences which help to improve their information culture and individual requests for the use of a variety of educational opportunities available in the electronic space. These ideas are fully consistent with the demanded by modern society the lifelong learning strategy.</p>

<p>The present study aimed to clarify EFL learners’ conceptions of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and whether their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> was correlated with their emotional intelligence. The research was carried out with the participation of 110 learners at Distance Education University in Urmia, Iran. Questionnaires were <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>ed to the participants. Results of statistical analyses revealed substantial correlations between learners’ conceptions of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and their emotional intelligence. ‘Independence’, ‘Stress Tolerance’, ‘Problem- Solving’, ‘Happiness’, ‘Self-actualization’, ‘Self-awareness’, ‘Optimism’, ‘Self-regard’, ‘Empathy,’ and ‘Impulse Control’ became the most determining elements of emotional intelligence (EI) for learners. Overall, the findings led the researcher to conclude that learners’ EI is a key factor influencing the extent to which they are ready to learn autonomously, and that teachers could therefore strive to ascertain learners’ intelligence type before they train them to become autonomous.</p>

<p>This paper is framed in a triennial project in the area of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies (ICT) in Mathematics Education. We constituted part of a group of university teachers who engaged in a kind of training teachers in service. In particular we were interested on the use of ICT in two senses: as a means of communication (<span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>) and as a teaching tool (GeoGebra). The work consisted on constructing a process of accompaniment to teachers of Mathematics at middle schools of four localities of Argentinean Patagonia. They were distributed in two groups of two schools each one. One group treated contents of algebra y the other one of functions. The process was to co-generate didactical cycles of three phases: priori analysis, commissioning classroom and posteriori analysis. In this presentation we pay attention to some aspects of the communicational use of the ICT which were made in the algebra group, with special focus in the produced levels of confidence and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.</p>

<p>With the widespread use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s and portable devices it is inevitable to think of Mobile Assisted Language Learning as a means of independent learning in Higher Education. Nowadays many learners are keen to explore the wide variety of applications available in their portable and always readily available <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s and tablets. The fact that they are keen to take control of their learning and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is thought to lead to greater motivation and engagement, and the link with games-based learning suggests that the fun factor involved should not be overseen. This paper focuses on the use of mobile applications for independent language learning in higher education. It investigates how learners use mobile apps in line with their classes to enhance their learning experience. We base our analysis on a survey carried out in autumn 2013 in which 286 credited and non-credited language students from various levels of proficiency at The University of Manchester express their perceptions on the advantages and disadvantages of the use of mobile applications for independent language learning, together with examples of useful apps and suggestions of how these could be integrated in the language class.</p>

<p>The term Open Educational Practice (OEP) is often defined as the process of creating and adapting OER. However, in the context of this study, we take OEP to include any practice that opens up a closed educational ecosystem by expanding learners’ social networks and by increasing learners’ participation and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Our study is framed in terms of one of the Research Hub’s guiding hypotheses: OER leads to critical reflection by educators, with evidence of improvement in their practice. In this case, the improved practice refers to how French-language educators sought to overcome prescriptivist attitudes linked to the monolingual orientation of traditional classroom instruction by adopting a translingual paradigm in keeping with recent research in applied linguistics (Cook, 1992, 1999; Blyth, 1995; MLA Report, 2007; Kramsch, 2010; Levine, 2011; Canagarajah, 2015). More precisely, we examine how language educators extended an titled Francais interactif (Blyth, 2009, 2012; Kelton, Guilloteau &amp; Blyth, 2011) by creating an accompanying <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> page as an online space (Gee, 2005) where traditionally proscribed practices such as code switching and lexical borrowing were not only accepted but encouraged. Following Canagarajah (2015), we understand translingual practice as an umbrella term referring to a language learner’s integrated repertoire of communicative strategies based on multiple languages and modalities. We examine the social dynamics of various translingual practices that routinely occur on the Francais interactif <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> page and conclude by arguing that open, translingual affinity spaces provide an ideal place for raising learners’ critical language awareness.</p>

<p>With the development of social network services (SNS) on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, the world has gained access to vast amounts of information resources, allowing people to carefully research and select what they need and want to share with others. The main idea behind open educational resources (OER) is providing freely accessible and openly licensed documents, which fits well with the online learning system using SNS. However, the gap between higher education and social network media in relation to shared activities and OER use remains a challenge. The main reason for this is that teachers lack knowledge of mutual assistance and the skills to use OER. Teachers are dissatisfied with having to use others’ resources, which indicates that the problem lies in teachers’ psychological conflicts and technical capabilities. Our learning platform, Creative Higher Education with Learning Objects (CHiLO), is based on e-textbooks and aims to develop a flexible learning environment. The CHiLO e-textbooks were developed with a completely new design that considered large-scale online courses, such as open online courses. The core component of CHiLO is the CHiLO Book, which is created in EPUB3 format and has media-rich contents, including graphics, animations, audios and embedded videos. Our set of experimental outcomes shows that CHiLO, which includes not only Web services but also e-textbooks, is easy for teachers to handle.</p>

<p>This paper is a study of blended learning pedagogy in open and distance learning (ODL), involving two universities in Southeast Asia, STOU Thailand and UT Indonesia. The purpose of this study is to understand the issues related to the implementation of blended-learning pedagogy. Existing theories in Distance education (DE) specifically interaction and communication theory proposed by Holmberg (1995), <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and independence theory based on the work Wedemeyer (1981) and Moore (1994) and community of inquiry (CoI) model contributed by Garrison, Anderson, and Archer (2000) are detected to provide a general picture on how practices in teaching-learning provisions and DE theories may inform each other. Qualitative case study was employed to optimize my understanding of the blended learning phenomena gathered through semi-structured interview and documentary analysis. Whilst they operated in different educational settings, these two universities shared similarities. They have developed blended learning pedagogy to promote students’ learning classified into three dimensions: printed learning materials, F2F sessions, and online learning. Printed materials, however, may be identified as a major one and online learning have been regarded as strategic policies for further development. They have been equipped with their VLE; the use of VLE helped these universities to provide two-way traffic communications. They have been involved in developing <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>-based instruction to widening access and to meet challenges for better future.</p>

<p>Global software engineering education (GSEE) is aimed at providing software engineering (SE) students with knowledge, skills, and understanding of working in globally distributed arrangements so they can be prepared for the global SE (GSE) paradigm. It is important to understand the challenges involved in GSEE for improving the quality and experience of educators and students. This paper reports the findings of an empirical study on the socio-cultural aspects of GSEE. A case study was conducted involving 14 participants from ten different universities in eight countries. The data was analyzed using grounded theory’s open coding procedure. The key contributions of this paper are the identification and description of seven dimensions of socio-cultural distance that caused several significant challenges in the courses: 1) language differences; 2) concept of time; 3) attitude toward grades; 4) assumptions about national culture; 5) differences in <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>; 6) influence of the course lecturer; and 7) work habits. Recommendations from this paper that are expected to benefit GSEE educators and students include: cross-cultural orientation of students prior to the course; use of various strategies to support better comprehension of different English accents (e.g., speaking slowly, replaying recorded video messages, and text <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>ting); and educators familiarizing themselves and their students with the relevant GSE and GSEE literature.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper presents a case study of using blended learning to enhance students language skills and learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in an Asian university environment. Blended learning represents an educational environment for much of the world where computers and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> are readily available. It combines self‑study with valuable face‑to‑face interaction with a teacher. This study puts the spotlight on learning outcomes in an English for Specific Purposes (ESP) class in Thailand in which e‑learning strategies are used in parallel with traditional classroom language teaching methods of the four language learning skills. These skills are listening, speaking, reading and writing. The achievements and attitudes of students were compared between the control group and the experimental group to measure the potential of available technology to develop language skills and learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The findings from this study show that online practice is directly beneficial to enhance the four language learning skills as well as autonomous learning and learner motivation.</p>

<p>In 2007, 10 groups of college students in an introductory-level religion course were asked to create a new religion that would appeal to their peers. This article analyzes the content of those religions, as well as student reflections on them, in light of quantitative studies and original analysis of a sample of college students drawn from Wave 3 of the National Study of Youth and Religion. It finds that college students see themselves and their cohort as interested primarily in religions that revolve around three axes: tolerance and inclusivity, moral and intellectual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and this-worldly happiness. These findings suggest that a synthesis of literature on the life course and on American moral culture provides the best analytical framework for viewing American college student approaches to religion and spirituality.</p>

<p>The availability of smart phones connected to mobile network and the occurrence of APPs developed for the educational purposes provide us with the possibility and feasibility of mobile teaching and learning. English Fun Dubbing, an APP designed for its users to practice oral English, was employed in this one-academic-year empirical study to evaluate the benefits of mobile APPs in the field of pedagogy. When the study ended, an anonymous online questionnaire was distributed to the 123 participants to survey the effects of English Fun Dubbing on their English language learning. The results showed that the majority of the respondents were satisfied with it in many aspects including its conveniences, flexibility, user-friendliness, rich materials, authentic language context, etc. and also its functions to inspire learning interests, foster learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, help realize personalized learning, and so on. We concluded that a reasonable and wise choice of APPs would not only be useful for students’ English learning, but also help lead them to use <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s in a positive way.</p>

<p>The twenty-first century higher education sector has come a long way after undergoing continuous metamorphosis from pedagogy to andragogy. Most of the educational approaches adopted in medical schools are directed towards developing more of competencies and less of capability, which is the ability to use competencies in novel contexts. Competencies alone are not sufficient to thrive in the present day work place as medical profession subsumes complex contexts; it is in this scenario that, medical educators are entrusted with the challenging task of developing “capable learners”. In the heutagogical approach, learners are required to decide upon what to learn and how to learn and therefore the control of the learning process is on the learner and the role of the teacher becomes that of a navigator. This paper highlights the current higher educational practices based on heutagogy, considers its application in the context of Problem-based learning and also discusses a few challenges in incorporating this approach in the existing undergraduate medical curriculum. The article proposes the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> in order to support learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, which in turn improves learners’ cognitive engagement with content and tasks, thereby assisting the development of attributes associated with capability.</p>

<p>Gifted student may underperform if unmotivated. Teachers can help students who are gifted to be motivated by using technology to help provide <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and authenticity in the curriculum. Technology can be used as a tool for student <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> when it is used in ways that give the student choices. Teacher can use the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> to provide students access to different topics. When students can control the depth and breadth of content through what they learn using technology, they are motivated. Technology also allows individual students control over the pacing of learning when they can accelerate through easily mastered or already mastered material, and then slow down when something particularly interesting is encountered. Authenticity, where students are doing work or experiencing learning activities that are equivalent to adult or expert experiences, are accessible to students through technology, but only if teachers plan for it. Particularly web 2.0 technologies allow students to create authentic products for authentic audiences because the can publish and share a variety of media. Technology can facilitate student collaboration and allow for mentoring from experts. Gifted students, who can be motivated by competition, can also increase the competitions available to them by looking for competitions online. Teachers control student access to and uses for technology within the school setting. If teachers are concerned about students who are gifted developing to their full potential, then planning for motivation makes sense and technology is a ready tool.</p>

A self-administered survey solicited students’ favor toward various aspects of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span> reflection assignment. An examination of students’ reflections as the course progressed was also undertaken.Approximately 2/3 of the students enrolled in the course responded to the survey. Student perceptions of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span> assignment were quite favorable, with highest favor related to facets regarding the construction of their own learning and continuation of engagement throughout the course. Responses to open-ended questions corroborated students’ perceptions of their own learning, as did the content and quality of their reflections during progression of the course.The course design reinforced previous claims outside of pharmacy that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span> can be a useful tool to reinforce or create new learning paradigms, but especially under the auspices of established theory, such as a constructivist environment employing constructionism pedagogy.

<p>This article presents an analysis of the revealed knowledge concerning the teaching practice in the interaction and mediation process developed by means of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>s in the virtual environment Moodle, throughout 2014, involving Science and Chemistry teachers of local schools, undergraduate students and professors of the Chemistry teaching degree course in the Universidade de Passo Fundo - RS. The extension project “Training for Science/Chemistry teachers: round of conversation involving teachers’ knowledge and practices” aims to establish the so called “Triads of Professional (interaction) Training”. This process aims to problematize the knowledge by experience and to allow reflection, an important aspect for the constitution of a teacher’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and protagonism. Data was analyzed based on a Discourse Textual Analysis. Results indicate that teachers have a being knowledge and a doing knowledge that originate from practice, but that need to be revealed and problematized so that it can produce progress and qualify the teaching action. The interaction process involving the triad is potentially significant for the continuous training.</p>

<p>In a flexible language learning system, developed at a French university and gradually improved through Action Research, different elements are combined: individual work on a virtual learning environment (VLE), pair-work and counselling appointments. One of the objectives of the system is to help the students involved progress towards <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> – defined as “the ability to take charge of one’s own learning” (Holec 1981: 3) or “as the capacity to take control over one’s own learning” (Benson 2001: 2) – in their learning of English. The implementation of the system involves a new conception of the different actors’ roles. Teachers become tutors, or counsellors, as defined by CRAPEL (Gremmo, 1995; Ciekanski, 2005) with new specific pedagogical goals (Bertin, Grave &amp; Narcy-Combes, 2010) and the learners have a new role to play. The introduction of two new guidance tools over the last years – a logbook, and specific sections in the existing forum of the VLE – were meant to help the students develop a reflexive approach and thus enhance autonomization, or developing learners’ capacity to learn (Holec 1990: 77), and, in a second time, to promote the development of collaborative learning strategies and encourage the students to use strategies which they would not primarily have thought of. The guidance tools used in this specific language learning environment such as the counselling appointments, the logbook, and the forum, may influence the roles played by the different actors, but also the representations they have of their own roles, which may have an impact on their motivation and thus on the autonomization process (Dickinson, 1995). From the creation of the flexible system five years ago, the research has studied a population of 610 students through quantitative and qualitative analyses (<span style="background-color:lightgreen">Chat</span>eau, 2008; <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Chat</span>eau &amp; Zumbihl, 2010). Focusing on the results obtained with the last population of students, the paper discusses the differences between them and the previous populations, and in particular whether the evolution of the roles played by the different actors, as compared with traditional language teaching/learning situations, has been enhanced.</p>

<p>Objetive: To evaluate the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of first-year university students at the University of Chile in 2015 Material and Method: Observational, transversal, and analytical study of first year students, 17 to 18 years of age, attending 14 Faculties, 2 Institutes, and 1 Bachelor Program of the University of Chile. Delivery of Kidscreen-52 test by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> to 3,738 students, of which 1,277 replied (34.16%). The Winsteps program model and Rasch punctuation were used. Results: The dimensions Physical Well-being, State of Mood and Emotions, and <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> scored less than 42 Rasch points, and the other two dimensions – Psychological Well-being and Friends and Social Support - had significantly lower scores than those found in Chilean adolescents of a comparable age, in women, in students of lower socio-economical levels in municipal public schools with a Scholar Vulnerability Index, or those with a disability, health problem, or chronic illness. The differences are greater in Faculties with heavier academic demands. Discussion: This first study gives new information in an area seldom studied, which is important for students, academics, and authorities. It is suspected that similar results would be found in other university settings. Conclusions: HRQoL studies are feasible to apply in institutions of higher education, to benefit both students and educators. This study contributes to the diagnosis and evaluation of public policies on student support, and for teaching strategies. In the near future, HRQoL instruments could be applied with other students and other members of the university community, in combination with studies on risk factors.</p>

A review of these sites shows that they have low standards as opposed to language teaching CD-ROMs. Generally speaking, affected largely from the structural approach, these sites present structural exercises while employing very few possibilities expected from the vast possibilities of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. In the absence of satisfactory explanations in relation to previously determined objectives and direction towards other sites, the students are not only misdirected but also exposed to trouble some self-measurement processes.

<p>Virtual spaces to help learn a language or write autonomously have become common and are only likely to increase. Multiple resources can be placed on a site easily accessible 24/7 and computer mediated communication in various forms can supply needed human interaction spaces. But how are these sites used by the local students? Following the path of several individuals in detail can allow more understanding and depth of the precise usage of space. This paper tracks two Arab students exploring and using a newly formed online self-access centre (SAC) for writing or online writing lab (OWL) for the best part of a semester. As an exploratory action research study, it was data driven and multiple data sources were mainly unobtrusive so that the study could proceed very naturally. The choices, learning style, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> types and personality differences between the two students suggest a range of support is ideal in an online SAC to cater for individuals in this context, including resources, how to learn, 1-1 asynchronous with advisor (<span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s), forums, electronic writing raters, and a high profile test. Ongoing action research should help to keep the online facility relevant to needs and open to new ways.</p>

<p>Self directed learning gives control and responsibility to a learner for learning, though there are three important conditions. These conditions are that the learner must at least be prepared to accept the degree of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> given to them. They must have the skills and attitudes required for developing and managing this <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. This paper throws light on Traditional and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> learning and affirms that understudy execution as measured by assessment is self-governing. 21st century guideline structure is advancing the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> usage to accomplish consideration of extra time-and place-bound students. Engineering students incline towards this to get the degree from top rank Universities or to learn particular course or surpass desires in a specific branch of knowledge. How many online understudies are compelling when stood out from their classroom accomplices is essential for demonstrating workforce and others blamed for evaluation. Eagerness in an online circumstance may be more trying in examination system classes than in other open association classes. In addition, backing may be less frightening, and the quality and measure of affiliation may be extended in online classes. The remote correspondence permits learner to get the taking in materials and addresses from any place the length of they are associated with the web. In this paper we likewise talk about the benefits and negative marks of both the strategies with the assistance of factual information examination by considering a group of Students from an engineering college. We also discuss the merits and demerits of both the methods with the help of statistical data analysis.</p>

<p>The following text presents an analysis of communication and collaboration as two central aspects in the design of virtual learning environments, noticing that in many offered courses the design does not necessarily focus on creating learning communities, but to develop a series of learning activities that basically maintain a control scheme by teaching through moderation and instructions, which leaves little margin for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and self-management among students. To this end, has been analyzed the MOOC <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies in Education in the Coursera platform. The working methodology was based on the review of the main concepts (communication and collaboration) discussed in relation to the AVA, the main topics of discussion forums, management students in learning communities, participation in various communication channels, results of course approval. These results demonstrated that communication and collaboration is possible in MOOCs, and how <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and motivation is substantial for collaborative efforts among hundreds of participants. The study confirmed that collaborative products can be made voluntarily, if participants have a common language and similar incentives.</p>

<p>Abstract This paper discusses the informal learning of English by non-native speakers with particular reference to the role of virtual communities. A model of informal language learning is presented and related to current areas of interest in the literature such as task-based learning and dynamic systems theory. This model is used to question the relevance of the learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> model, which has been a cornerstone of language learning policy in Europe for the past 30 years. A research project is discussed, with particular attention to the relevant research methodologies in this field, investigating how non-specialist language learners use the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> in their spare time to read and listen to English, and also communicate in English, notably in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>ies through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking website</span>s.</p>

<p>Mobile Assisted Language Learning, a specialization of mobile learning, represents a new field of the educational system, which offers new possibilities of delivering content to learners and facilitates the learning process. Mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) or m-learning which is defined as learning with mobile devices that can be utilized in any place that is equipped with unbroken transmission signals<a href="#aff-1">1</a> has created new opportunities and challenges for educational use. It introduced a new learning model combining new types of mobile devices, wireless communication services and technologies with teaching and learning. Recent advancements in the mobile world such as the Apple IOS devices (IPhone, IPod Touch and IPad), Android devices and other <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> devices and environments (such as Windows Phone 7and Blackberry), allowed learning to be more flexible inside and outside the classroom, making the learning experience unique, adaptable and tailored to each user [2]. Creativity, learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, collaboration and digital practices of language learners are encouraged as well as innovative pedagogical applications, like the flipped classroom, for such practices in classroom contexts are enhanced. These developments are gradually embedded in daily life and they also seem to be heralding the sustainable move to paperless classrooms. Since these varied digital technologies are increasingly viewed as a main platform for delivery, we as educators need to design our activities, materials and learning environments in such a way to ensure that learners are engaged and feel comfortable. This paper presents how apps (for Apple devices) can be integrated into teaching and learning in higher education. Current Approaches to MALL The use of mobile devices in education has become common across all educational sectors and the range of research into the use of mobile communication technologies for the purposes of language learning has been diverse. This is motivated by a search for effective pedagogical innovations and educational applications of new media since classroom instruction needs to constantly adapt to new technologies and interests. As mobile learning has gradually gained popularity, several researchers have attempted to develop models and frameworks to explain where and how mobile learning fits within the context of education to support various kinds of learning. Pereira and Rodrigues [3] presented “the evolution of the learning models” where mobile learning is the most recent model, which reduces the limitations of the previous models. Fig. 1. The evolution of the learning models [3] Naismith, Lonsdale, Vavoula and Sharples’ report [4] stated that mobile devices can support traditional pedagogical approaches as well as contemporary approaches. In their literature review, Viberg and Gronlund [5] found that the theories and models applied on MALL mostly derive from previous theories of learning such as constructivism and social constructivism. With a constructivist approach to learning, learners actively generate ideas or concepts based on their current knowledge and build on what they already know as they are encouraged to collaborate with peers to do so. Project-based learning, a constructivist approach, allows mobile technology integration in meaningful ways so that learners can explore and develop content purposefully and engage in authentic problem-based, casebased and inquiry-based learning using the most efficient mobile applications and tools such as mobile investigations or casual games. A more recent development is Siemens’ theory of “connectivism” [6] which is described as “..including technology and connection making as learning activities begins to move learning theories into a digital age”. Combining connectivism with constructivist approaches offers learners an opportunity to achieve 21 st century skills such as technology-mediated multi tasking. Blended-learning approach [7] is another way to integrate mobile technology applications into classroom practice by using Learning Management System Apps or Personal Learning Environments such as blogs. The flipped classroom, where the sequence of activities or assignments is rearranged so learners watch teacher created videos outside the classroom so that they spend more time for practice in class, is conceptually grounded in active learning and student engagement theories and is made effective with MALL applications. Given that mobile technology devices and tools are still rather new and developing, using an integrated pedagogy in ways that support engagement of learners should be the driving force behind our classroom practice. MALL Apps in Language Learning Mobile technology involves the use of portable devices that are also embedded in our daily lives, such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s, smart phones, tablet PCs and other hand-held gadgets and the fact that learners are already using communication facilities and technology-related activities such as content creation on their portable gadgets has contributed to teachers’ efforts to integrate them into teaching and learning. These screen-based technologies are significant in educational technology as they provide many advantages like mobility of the learners and flexibility of the learning environment, connectivity and accessibility to materials, authenticity, creativity and collaborative learning. With MALL, learners are able to combine the advantages of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> with personalized and ongoing learning activities anytime, anywhere. Ally [8] describes mobile learning as “powerful support for effective learning and performance-based assessment”. Since the arrival of Apple IPhone in 2007 and the IPad in 2010, a wide range of MALL applications have been developed which are intended to enhance the learning process, create a learner-centred environment and focus on the ongoing process of learning rather than the end result. Learners increasingly lead tech-filled lives outside the classroom and mobile apps offer the ability to capture the full attention of the learners with full customization in regards to personal preferences and differentiation. There are a lot of apps available for carrying out a variety of tasks from media creation to productivity.</p>

<p>Teaching languages to migrants through ICT L-Pack Project for Italian and other languages (Citizenship Language Pack for Migrants in Europe) The most recent trends in technology and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>, commonly called Web 2.0., have determined new concepts in teaching and learning that involve <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, multimodality and flexibility. New approaches to ‘knowledge by technology’ are changing both teachers’ and learners’ roles, responding to their different aims and needs. At the same time, nearly 4 million people are presently involved in massive migration processes all over Europe, coming either from outside Europe or from another EU member state. The EU policies on migrants state the importance of a basic knowledge of the host country’s language, history and institutions for an effective integration process, and EU governments are expected to contribute to this aim. This paper describes the European Project ‘L-PACK: Citizenship Language Pack For Migrants in Europe’ (2011-2016), whose main aim consisted in developing a series of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> video texts, accompanied with materials and resources to lead adult migrants to A2 level (according to QCER levels scale) in different EU languages. The project has been developed in two main stages. In the first part of the programme, called L-Pack 1, from 2011 to 2013, the languages were Italian, Spanish, German, Lithuanian, Greek and Czech. In the second part, called L-Pack 2 extended, from 2014 to 2016, the project added English and French and was integrated with new resources and tools. The L-PACK course, which consists of 60 short video dialogues from everyday life, supported by comprehension activities and linguistic explanation and rules, is totally free and available through Youtube, Wikibooks and Soundcloud. The dedicated website http://www.l-pack.eu was visited by 120.000 users from 146 countries in the period 2011-2016. L-Pack teaching materials have also been used by teachers in classroom activities. The authors analyze and evaluate the results of the L-Pack Project, from pilot to dissemination, in different learning contexts both in situ and through e-learning. This is carried out on the basis of surveys concerning the project as a whole and in particular its use in Italian language teaching classes for migrants in Italy.</p>

<p>AbstractThis paper opens by summarising the case for student-directed learning in online higher education as a means of bringing about the development and use of higher-level cognitive and interpersonal abilities such as critical and creative thinking. The writers refine their conceptualisations of student-direction, different to, but flowing from student-centred learning, by scrutinising a progressive series of face-to-face examples offering some <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in learning. Nine features are identified as essential in a student-directed programme. They review Garrison’s recent account of learning-centred Communities of Inquiry (CoI), identifying aspects of the teacher/instructor’s role that would need to be altered for student-directed <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>ies. Guidelines are suggested for creating a student-directed CoI including programme design addressing the development, and use, of generic abilities. Finally, the writers provide an example programme structure incorporating preparation of learners for the respon…</p>

<p>This paper aims to expose the results of a qualitative research process based by participatory research methodology, developed within a research of Theory and Pedagogical Practice in the Instruction of Professors, from the StrictoSensu Post-Graduate Program in Education (PPGE) at Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Parana (PUCPR), Curitiba, Brazil, as part of the activities of the research group Pedagogical Practice on Teaching and Learning with Educational Technologies (PRAPETEC) research group. From 2013 to 2016, several actions were developed by the research group to contribute to research on collaborative learning, co-creation, open education and open educational resources, due to a partnership with the Collaborative Open Learning Community (coLearn) under the coordination of Dr.&nbsp;Alexandra Okada. In this context, the question to this investigation was as follows: how can open educational resources (OER) development on Higher Education in a collaborative process of co-creation contribute to student learning? The aim of this study was to promote a collaborative and open educational experience for students through the creation of OER as well as the incorporation of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>, YouTube and Whats App as supporting environments in the teaching and learning process. Based on the analysis of the obtained results, it was observed that this experience was positive for contributing to the knowledge production in a collaborative way, with criticality, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and creativity. And also, the students experienced an innovative methodology, allowing those who already act as professors to reflect on their pedagogical practice.</p>

<p>This study explored patterns of interaction in a synchronous Computer Mediated Communication (CMC) collaborative activity in an English as a Foreign Language (EFL) setting in the Saudi Arabian context. The study focused on the use of synchronous <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Chat</span> in teaching and learning. Collaborative learning is considered to lead to a deeper level of learning, enhanced critical thinking, shared understanding and long-term recognition of the learned material. A qualitative approach was used in the data collection process. Participants were 20 high school students, native speakers of Arabic, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The study examined participants’ English usage in conversation, a quiz, and a discussion, all of which took place online, in a CMC format. There was also a paired work presentation of 25 minutes’ duration. Results revealed that CMC enabled learners to further their understanding of instructional content and to better apply what they had learned when they were placed in a group. The results from the online discussion showed that participants’ linguistic performance improved, including better utilization of words. Although grammatical usages lack certain accuracy, the use of CMC to a larger extent contributed to enhanced communication skills and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Based on the findings some suggestions and recommendations were provided as to aid teachers as well as students in implementing the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> technology in EFL classrooms.</p>

<p>Innovation happens when minds come together to share (Ferriter &amp; Provenzano, 2013, p.&nbsp;19). The commitment to evolving ideas is a cornerstone of academia, informing the varied teaching and learning spaces we occupy as well as the professional spaces where we collaborate, share, and learn: from faculty lounges to hallways, from conferences to journals, from handwritten correspondences to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s, blogs, and tweets. 21st century technologies continue to multiply, affording us an ever expanding arena of modalities and methods to refine and impart our intellectual craftsmanship as scholars and as faculty developers. Faculty developers can benefit from the insights, methods, and examples of the unconference as a powerful platform for imagining and crafting dynamic and potentially transformative faculty learning experiences (West, 2012).The unconference is powerful because of the rate at which ideas can be generated and shared; because the unconference celebrates <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and encourages the emergence of our personal narratives; because the unconference challenges traditional notions of learning space redefining the locations, relationships and by which we communicate and build understanding; and because of the unconference’s democratic-participatory structure (Association for Learning Technology; Kassner, 2014). The unconference is an arena of possibilities that organically build off the very foundations that drive those interested in developing knowledge to connect with others. Conceived as such, the unconference can substantively inform and inspire new directions for the future of faculty development so that the field continues to remain programmatically relevant, agile, and exciting.With the spirit of exploration in mind, this paper discusses the what, why, and how of unconferencing and probes its implications as a transformative approach to faculty development in higher education. The paper examines theory that informs the unconference, canvasses resources and tools that can be used to organize and build unconference learning experiences, and highlights ways the unconference can prompt critical reflection among faculty. To this end, best practices and strategies are offered, including reference to web-based resources that may assist in preparations for unconference experiences. Moreover, the authors discuss the importance of and methods for networking stakeholders as a practical means by which to set strong foundations for unconferencing to take place and become valued on institutional campuses. Three iterations of unconferencing as modes for substantively engaging faculty are examined as a practical basis for considering implications of the unconference on the future of faculty development.What is an Unconference and How is it Different?‘Unconferences’ are a non-traditional form of professional activity defined by the absence of many conventional conference structures (Carpenter, 2015, p.&nbsp;78). Stated differently, ‘Unconferences’ are voluntary, informal learning experiences that reject traditional conference such as a predetermined slate of speakers and sessions (Boule, 2011). Unconferences manifest themselves in different ways, yet all share common principles and structures. At its core, unconference events are participant driven. From topics to participation, from goals to agendas, the unconference works to organically surface interests and problems relevant to those attending, provide a place for them to work, and relies on the contributions of each participant to move group defined goals forward. The unconference approach is in direct contrast to traditional academic conference that exemplify more didactic modes of engagement.To a large extent, attending a [traditional] conference can be a passive experience (Sweeting &amp; Hohl, 2015, p.&nbsp;2). The roots of dominant conference formats date back to the 1660’s when travel and copies of physical manuscripts posed challenging obstacles to sharing knowledge. …</p>

<p>The Context of Worth Striking For Isabel NunezI WAS A FIRST GRADE TEACHER in Southern California in the early 1990s, and it was the most fulfilling work I’ve ever done. This was back in the days before curriculum standardization-or even standards; my first graders took one standardized test a year and the results were only used to help us teach them better. I spent 5 years abroad and returned to an educational landscape that was nearly unrecognizable.My current students, who are teaching now, have a hard time imagining what this was like: the freedom and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> that I enjoyed in my classroom. My graduate students will sometimes ask me ‘What did you do at staff meetings?’ Well, we did have staff meetings, and we did complain about how long they were, but we did NOT analyze test score data. We had the luxury of talking about students as people, not as numbers.From No Child Left Behind to the current push for teacher evaluation via test scores and ranking, it has been a really tough decade or so to be an educator. Every few weeks brings another devastating discovery, whether a new round of school closures or a ridiculous-sounding idea from a conservative think tank-which by now we’ve learned is likely to turn up as a serious policy proposal. I used to laugh at these, but now I tremble.Watching all the dots connect has been worse still: It’s not well-intentioned error; it’s a strategic assault on public education as an enterprise. Most recently, the offensive has been targeted at teachers themselves. I’m already seeing the signs of despair in my graduate students as the public discourse casts teachers as enemy number one-even while high-stakes testing makes it harder to actually teach. The efforts to undermine teachers’ unions and tenure, programs like Teach for America which ask just a few years’ commitment to the classroom: All of these point in one direction. If the reform movement is successful, teaching will no longer be a career, but a job-and a low-paid, temporary one at that. Since for most teachers, neither of these is an adequate descriptor for what is truly a vocation, the struggle in which we are now engaged is for our very survival as professionals.I was feeling demoralized, disillusioned, and dangerously close to despair in 2012. There is very little exaggeration when I say that the Chicago teachers’ strike saved my life. Being in Chicago then, as the city’s teachers took to the streets, was transformative. The summer vote by Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) members authorizing the strike garnered more than 90% of Chicago teachers’ approval. It flew in the face of a statutory requirement that 75% of members authorize a strike-a legislative move that was designed to be debilitating to teachers’ unions. In fact, Jonah Edelman, the astroturf reform group Stand for Children CEO, had bragged in Aspen that he’d succeeding in ensuring that the CTU would never strike. He envisioned a state-by-state capitulation that would neutralize the power of unions nationwide. Well, the teachers had something to say about that.During the strike itself, teachers showed incredible courage and dignity, never flinching in their support of their students and their schools-this despite the threat to their bank accounts and the attacks on their already battered reputations. One of my own students shared how she cried as she read the callously critical comments on the strike from some <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> ‘friends’ - until just then she saw herself on the news in front of Chicago Public Schools (CPS) headquarters and was re-energized. As the strike came to a close, CTU president Karen Lewis explained that this is not just about teachers, connecting the event to the wider struggle for basic fairness to workers, a fight that is only intensifying.This was our inspiration for writing Worth Striking For: Why Education Policy is Every Teacher ’s Concern. Pamela Konkol, Gregory Michie, and I initially proposed a book of education history on the strike to Teachers College Press. …</p>

<p>The article aims to contribute to the reflection on the researchers’s education experience in different modalities (onsite and distance) allied to theoretical elements, to understand the insertion process of the university professor in the distance mode classes (EaD, in portuguese), during the expansion period of the fully e-learning or semi-distance higher education courses (2010-2016). The problematizing question is to what extent our teaching practice in distance education distracts the teacher from his praxis? We start from the assumption that it is necessary to understand the dimension of the process of proletarianization, alienation, wich distances the teacher from his praxis, that is, from his <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in class preparation, from content management and also human relations with his students, in order to evaluate the consequences for the educator. After all. it is discussed the context of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>culture, wich requires a new practice in virtual space and time for online education.</p>

<p>The European Language Portfolio (ELP) is a tool for developing learner responsibility and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> through reflection and self-awareness. The ELP is based on the Common European Framework (CEF) Reference Levels that enable learners to describe what they can do in different languages. The CEF is a Council of Europe initiative aimed at improving the learning of foreign languages. This paper uses the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> to look at how the ELP has been implemented in different settings and to suggest how the ELP may be approached. The paper introduces a small-scale case study of ELP pilot implementation in a university preparatory school. The results from this institution show many similarities with responses in other places, and demonstrate the importance of integrating the ELP with the existing programme, providing teacher training and clarifying the status and purpose of the ELP. Analysis of documents on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> shows a number of important factors. The most successful examples of ELP use involved integration of the ELP in the institution’s programme, training for teachers and students and a high level of commitment of time and financial resources by teachers and administrators. Responses from teachers were often extremely positive, others showed interest but many also expressed reservations about the ELP. Student responses were generally but not universally positive and a number of criticisms were raised concerning the status and purpose of the ELP. The paper provides full <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> links so readers can access the same documents. The paper concludes firstly that future ELP use could exploit the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> for teacher training and secondly that thorough preparation of staff, students and programmes are needed when an innovative tool such as ELP is introduced. The basis for thorough preparation could involve detailed familiarisation with the CEF Reference Levels.</p>

<p>This paper identifies Malaysian university students’ needs and preferences for online English language activities on a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> group that supports their formal learning. Two methods of data collection were employed; content analysis of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> interactions, and semi structured interviews. Four main learning preferences or characteristics of online activities are identified; a) teacher-led activities (tasks and learning content provided by teachers), b) teachers’ presence (one or two authority figures to facilitate learning and keep group lively), c) topics or content (entertainment-oriented, grammar quizzes, opinion-based discussions), d) structure of the group (optional and ungraded). The passive participants found the activity beneficial in improving their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communication</span> ability, while the more active participants felt a boost of confidence to use English in a more public space like <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>. The findings indicate that the students are in need of technological changes in learning, but are dependent on teachers’ instructions to initiate the process. They exert selective interests in learning topics and content, and demonstrate partial <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in negotiating the online group’s structure. The theoretical and practical implications, and recommendation for future research are briefly presented.</p>

<p>In school settings, self-control is central to the ability of learners to complete their academic work successfully. Learners’ self-control is directly influenced by the ways in which educators execute their work, including their instructional explanations, their classroom management, and the expectations that they express to their learners. Our research on this phenomenon investigated Finnish and Swedish learners in upper secondary schools. Not only is the use of digital technology very different in these two countries; the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and status of educators are as well. This article compares the empirical significance of antecedents of learners’ academic self-control in the two national settings by surveying 2191 learners in Swedish and Finnish schools. Our analysis applies structural equation modeling to two cross-sectional datasets, and the results reveal that the associations between educators’ instructional explanations, classroom management, and their high expectations on the one hand and learners’ academic self-control on the other are stronger overall among Finnish students than among Swedish students. Furthermore, the association between digital technology use and learners’ perceptions of conflict between school norms and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> opportunities are much stronger in the Swedish sample than the Finnish sample. Lastly, we discuss the meaning of these results and their possible implications for research and practice.</p>

<p>This paper attempts to shed some light on the activities and facilities in one Self-Access Center (SAC) in one university in Bandung. On the ground of this investigation, a context description of SAC in university levels is put forward followed by an overt statement of the objectives and the rationales of the study. There are three research problems being investigated: What is the typology of the SAC? What are the self-access language learning (SALL) activities and materials provided in this SAC? And how do the students perceive the self-access language learning (SALL) activities and materials? This qualitative study reveals that this SAC is categorized into supermarket typology of SAC. This is because of the SAC system offers learners the chance to look around and choose what they want to study. This system displays materials under clearly marked categories like in supermarket. This typology of SAC is suitable for all learner contexts (Gardner and Miller, 2008). However, this SAC still lack the materials and activities for SALL. Further development, in terms of materials and activities which can promote learning <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> should be done. Most students (72%) perceive positively about certain SAC facilities, such as books, resources, strong <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> connection, and cozy environment of reading and writing area. However, there should be more improvement in certain SAC facilities (such as rooms for consultation with SAC tutor, TV viewing area) and certain SAC activities (such as English club and native speaker contact).

<p>As <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y grows wider and more influential in shaping the training of translators recently, the needs to reformulate translator’s competences are also increasing. By combining some necessary traits and characteristics of good translators coming from the field of linguistics with critical pedagogy fostered in Academic Writing course, the author will argue that translation teaching within the framework of Academic Writing class, yields creativity and more promises on the spirit of keeping humanization alive which is at the same time challenged by the ascent notion of machine translation. The growing dependence on using google translate, for most of the students observed in this case study, highlights the importance to embrace both familiarity with the logic and limitation of MT as well as rootedness within the discourse which empowers human <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, thus didactic translation. In this respect, the lecturer plays dual role in becoming role-model for students in translation as well as critical evaluator for their imperfect results of translating text on plagiarism seen from the linguistic phenomenon.</p>

<p>In the last few decades, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies (ICTs) and Self-Regulation have become topics of prime interest in education. ICTs, for instance, are nowadays widely used in English as a foreign language (EFL) classes for being effective tools in facilitating teaching and learning. On the other hand, self-regulated learning is broadly demanded toemphasise students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and engagement in the learning process. With regard to educational psychology, self-regulated learning (SRL) has a notable effect on students’ cognition, metacognition, motivation, and behaviours. However, in self-regulated learning, unlike self-directed learning, the teacher is primarily involved in the students’ regulation practices. This creates a challenge to the teachers concerning their abilities to support self-regulation inside the classroom walls and in a limited time, especially with the rapid evolution of technology including online platforms. The major concern of this research paper lies in the ways that support students’ self-regulation. Therefore, it ultimately discusses how online platforms, the case of ‘Easyclass’ can strengthen students’ self-regulation skills in order to improve their achievement. It also tries to assist instructors in teaching students how to be effective self-regulated learners and promote their study skills and habits through technologies.</p>

<p>One of the most important approaches in the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICTs) in the teaching-learning process is to be able to implement digital educational resources (REDs) that favor educational <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the student and that Allow the teacher to focus on more meaningful and specific areas of knowledge. This article presents the results of a research project whose purpose was to evaluate the RED as a didactic tool in the elaboration of the instructional guide that allows the design of digital educational resources, as a support to the classroom. This research was contextualized in the classroom work of university professors of the University Jorge Tadeo Lozano (Bogota, Colombia). The results allowed to determine the perception of the teachers on the RED as a didactic tool and to sustain strategies for their elaboration and use.</p>

<p>The coupling of the traditional classroom instruction and a virtual learning environment (VLE) in an engineering course is critical to stimulating the learning process and to encouraging students to develop competencies outside of the classroom. This can be achieved through planned activities and the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICTs), resources designed to complement students’ autonomous learning needs. A quantitative analysis of students’ academic performance using final course grades was performed for a fundamentals of electronics course and we examine students’ perception of their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> using surveys. The students’ progress and attitudes were monitored over four consecutive semesters. The first began with the design of the intervention and the following three consisted in the implementation. The strategy was focused on the development of course competencies through autonomous learning with ICT tools presented in the VLE. Findings indicate that the students who did the activities in the VLE showed an increase in performance scores in comparison with students who did not do them. The strategy used in this study, which enhanced perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, was associated with a positive effect on their learning process. This research shows that a technology-enhanced course supported by ICT activities can both improve academic performance and foster <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in students.</p>

<p>This paper discusses the findings of a research study concerning the use of e-portfolios to develop learners’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and independence, from the perspectives of teachers and students participating in this study. The findings demonstrate many of the benefits of e-portfolio practice regarding learners’ increased sense of ownership, teacher and peer feedback, enriched learning experience at both individual and technological levels, enhanced opportunity for self-improvement and increased awareness of the learning process. Despite many positive aspects of e-portfolios use, the study reveals some challenges facing students, teachers and support staff, mainly connected with technical problems and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> access, and the necessity for teachers and learners to change their roles to become more independent in the learning process. The author concludes that e-portfolio is a promising tool to stimulate and challenge students to become independent and self-regulated learners that should be implemented in English language learning at higher educational institutions.</p>

As a basic research tool we created an e-portofolio utilising the Mahara software. In this research, 12 second grade students from an urban area of Athens took part. The introduction of the e-portofolio was created in two phases during the school year 2014-2015. Initially, the pilot application in the program ‘all the earth, an embrace’ and the main one was realised with the program ‘the water’. Through the methodological approach of the qualitative action research we concluded that cooperation and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> can be achieved within the context of the educational community in a distance learning environment with the use of guided educational dialogue.</p>

<p>English are multifaceted and polymathic. Alongside our students, we explore cultures, perspectives, and lived experiences through text, often encouraging intellectual development and affective maturation (Williams, 2012, p.&nbsp;xi). Thus, through such diverse learning, sometimes-complicated discussions arise, and texts that touch on sexualities surface our classrooms. Pickering (2004), who inspired the film Dead Poets Society (1989), argues that teachers never escape sexual doings (p.&nbsp;237); if it true that (in general) can’t escape sex, how might English (in particular) purposefully integrate it their curriculum? Johnson (2015), citing Lewis and Tierney’s (2011) work, posits in the English classroom, where personal growth often an explicit part of the curriculum . . . , sex might seem a natural fit (p.&nbsp;61). Therefore, English would do well to develop effective teaching strategies for addressing issues related to sex education including sexualities, healthy relationships, consent, and so forth. Further, finding dynamic ways for educators to exercise reflexivity their teaching practice also important when trying new approaches to learning.I have been fortunate to teach English a progressive public secondary school western Canada where the have a great deal of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to develop curriculum that attends to students’ collective needs and interests. As Brezicha, Bergmark, and Mitra (2014) argue, Effectively leading a complex and dynamic system requires leaders who [understand and respect] how individuals make sense of their work while working within the context of their social environment and boundaries of the school setting (p.&nbsp;124). We have such leadership at the helm of our school, which I realize makes my context a bit of an educational nirvana. Nonetheless, I hope my experiences might have some applicability for the readers of English Education.As evidence of our school’s commitment to best practices, my administration approached me as the English department leader to organize our five literacy to embed a healthy relationships curriculum, comprised of sex and consent education material, into grade 9 English. As Jones (2011) describes, this curriculum is seen as a hyponym under which sub-types such as sex education (education mainly concerned with the act of intercourse or reproduction), relationship education (education mainly concerned with the creation of romantic or sexual relationships) and other types fall (p.&nbsp;371). This opportunity emerged from challenges with scheduling the ninthgrade class timetable, which runs differently than other grades. In an effort to provide new options, physical education classes faced losing critical time the gymnasium unless another department took on teaching the health curriculum component, which how our English team got this exciting chance to explore sex education with a fresh approach.Fortunately, each teacher had previously taught sex education some capacity, including roles such as a physical education teacher, a social worker, a volunteer sexual assault counselor, or teacher of a locally developed career and life management course that included a healthy relationships curriculum. As such, we had complete freedom with bringing this learning our classrooms; we could simply take a break from our literacy studies to complete the curriculum, or we could integrate with a text or film study- whatever would work best.Each teacher uniquely approached the subject matter, embracing the opportunity to try something new. As we taught it differently, we also supported one another by sharing our ideas and observations, swapping lesson plans, and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>ing links to resources. This a common practice our department, as the majority of us contend, meaningful collaboration benefits educators and students alike (Ketterlin-Geller, Baumer, &amp; Lichon, 2015, p.&nbsp;…</p>

<p>Objective: Health sciences training programs have progressively expanded onto satellite campuses, allowing students the opportunity to learn in communities away from an academic institution’s main campus. This expansion has encouraged a new role for librarians to assume, in that a subset of health sciences librarians identify as “satellite librarians” who are permanently located at a distance from the main campus. Due to the unique nature of this role and lack of existing data on the topic, the authors investigated the experiences and perceptions of this unique group of information professionals. Methods: An electronic survey was distributed to health sciences librarians via two prominent North American <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> discussion lists. Questions addressed the librarians’ demographics, feelings of social inclusion, technological support, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, professional support, and more. Results: Eighteen surveys were analyzed. While several respondents stated that they had positive working relationships with colleagues, many cited issues with technology, scheduling, and lack of consideration as barriers to feeling socially included at both the parent and local campuses. Social inclusion, policy creation, and collection management issues were subject to their unique situations and their colleagues’ perceptions of their roles as satellite librarians. Conclusions: The results from this survey suggest that the role of the academic health sciences librarian at the satellite campus needs to be clearly communicated and defined. This, in turn, will enhance the experience for the librarian and provide better service to the client.</p>

<p>Abstract Together with recent technological advances in a variety of tools (such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span>, Google, YouTube), learners have been provided with freedom and openness to communicate with each other and to become proactive and independent in their learning. It is believed, however, that Asian learners seem to possess reactive <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> so that while they can organize their resources autonomously to achieve their learning goals, they are unable to take responsibility for their own learning. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to explore the factors that influence Vietnamese EFL learners’ support for or resistance to promoting learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> within a 15-week, portfolio-based writing course. The data were collected using semi-structured interviews and writing logs in this qualitative research and analyzed through content analysis. The findings showed three major factors (personal, academic, and external) supporting and resisting developing learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the portfolio-based writing course.</p>

<p>Based on the status growth of professional development of future specialists when studying at higher educational establishments, the author of the article outlined the tasks designed to solve the specifics of the approach to independent work organization in the professional training process of future teachers of the first (Bachelor) level of higher education by example of studying profile and practical disciplines. The emphasis is made on a number of new tasks related to the education content update. Implementation of the function of deliberate development management lies in a combination of traditional education with modern electronic technologies. Therefore, in order to achieve the training objectives (the expected application of acquired competencies) and improve the quality of education, a student must master existing forms of self-education. The practicability of using electronic means in educational activities has been proved as most students are active <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and programs users that help to interest them, concentrate students’ attention on studying new material, motivate their active cognitive activity. Since it is a priority task of modern higher education establishments to create pedagogical conditions for the identification and development of students’ abilities, satisfaction of their needs and interests, formation of competences, development of educational and cognitive activity and creative <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, purposeful regulation of independence development is carried out in the process of educational interaction by helping to form creative student activity experience. The pedagogical aspect of students’ motivation for independent cognitive activity has also been analyzed in the article by the author. It has been proved that the formation of educational motives is directly proportional to the success and further individual development as a future specialist.</p>

<p>ICT plays a vital role in English language learning since it boosts motivation (Schoepp &amp; Erogul, 2001), learners’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (Tri. et al., 2014) and learning skills (Galavis, 1998). This study aimed to examine the effects of ICT-based learning using wiki on learning of students’ vocabulary mastery at the junior high school. The design of the present study was quasi-experimental study. The population of the study was seventh graders of a junior high school in Bandung. Experimental group and control group comprised of 25 students each. The instruments of the study were a pre-test and a post-test of vocabulary mastery and an online learning platform called wiki. The data were analyzed by SPSS 16.0 for the windows. The findings revealed that there were significant differences at .05 level between experimental group and control group (df= 49, t= 2.02). Furthermore, recommendations are proposed for the teachers whose teaching philosophy is twisted with ICT-based learning. For instance, they should provide an interesting topic on the wiki, let them <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> while working online, assign them working at home and well prepare the facilities used in the class before starting of the lesson.</p>

<p>This descriptive type of cross sectional study was carried out to observe the hospital educational environment of selected postgraduate medical institutes of Bangladesh. Study period was from July 2016 to June 2017.Sample size was 289 postgraduate clinical students of various course (MD, FCPS &amp; Diploma) and 20 clinical teachers of 10 selected postgraduate medical institutes of Bangladesh. Convenience sampling technique was adopted. Data collection was done with self- administered semi-structured questionnaire using Postgraduate Hospital Educational Environment Measurement (PHEEM) inventory and by In-depth interview of teachers. Three subscales of PHEEM are students’ perceptions about ‘role <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>’, students’ perceptions about quality of teaching and students’ perceptions about social support. In-depth interview of the clinical teachers was undertaken to explore the training facilities in the selected postgraduate medical institutes of Bangladesh. Study result revealed total PHEEM score was110.08.Mean score of subscales of PHEEM were 34.51, 36.29 and 26.28 for ‘role <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>’, quality of teaching and social support respectively. All these values indicates that the students’ perception were in the right or positive direction. Analysis of individual items had shown mean score of most of the individual item were 2-3 that indicated the aspects of the climate that could be enhanced. There were few items that had mean score 2 or less than 2 that indicated the problematic areas of hospital educational environment. In-depth interview of the teachers revealed that there was also some problematic issues on postgraduate training facilities like work overload, lack of proper monitoring or supervision of training, inadequate library, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>, ICU and investigation facilities etc. Study recommended that significant attention should be paid in the problematic areas (lack of supervised training, heavy work load of student, lack of library facility etc.) as well as improvement needed on several areas of hospital educational environment of postgraduate medical institutes of Bangladesh.

In particular we explicate the ‘work’ involved in anticipating need using an ethnomethodological analysis that makes visible the mundane, ‘seen but unnoticed’ methodologies that household members accountably employ to organise list construction and accomplish calculation on the shop floor. We discuss and reflect on the challenges members’ methodologies pose for proactive systems that seek to support domestic grocery shopping, including the challenges of sensing, learning and predicting, and gearing autonomous agents into social practice within the home.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION. The change of approach advocated by the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFRL), implemented by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>y (ICT), has led to the Electronic European Language Portfolio (eELP). This new model involves a change in methodology, which benefits from new ways of managing information and interacting with the personal learning environment. METHOD. This article analyzes the development of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> through the eELP by using data collected in a qualitative study conducted on a group of students studying German (level A2.1 of the CEFRL) of the Official School of Languages of Alicante (Spain) between October 2016 and February 2017. The purpose of this study is to analyze the progression of the students in three subsections of the section Learning to learn of the eELP: Reflection and organization, Learning the new and Fixing the learned. RESULTS . If we analyze the results, we conclude that the eELP has encouraged the change of focus from the teacher to the student. Likewise, meaningful learning has meant that the activities have had to be adapted to the student in regards to goals, content and tasks, thus responding to the needs of the learner, so that it has been possible to integrate and restructure these activities in their world of experiences. DISCUSSION . The motivation of all the students has increased and they have developed confidence in themselves thanks to the positive formulation of their capacities through rubrics. In spite of the progress in <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, the implementation time has been insufficient to develop all the capacities that integrate autonomous learning.</p>

<p>This article presents a pedagogical strategy for the education of journalists in higher education. Its main characteristic is that it occurs mainly on the social web, with the students sharing their journalistic productions in a collective blog and discussing their work on a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> page. The strategy also aims at developing the sense of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and democratic participation of the students and their awareness of the values and practices of the profession. The strategy is the culmination of a three-cycle action-research project, developed over a period of five years, on how to educate journalists through innovative learning experiences based on new technologies. We believe that both the strategy and the research that led to it may be inspiring to educators and researchers concerned with the challenges of education on the social web.</p>

<p>Summary The article presents a scientific analysis of a practical application of multilingual and multicultural education at higher education, more specifically, the description of the eTandem project developed and launched by the Language Center of the University of Padua, which won the European Language Label (ELL) in December 2016. The project was selected and nominated since it provides a methodological approach and study strategies which favour multilingualism, mobility for young people and inclusiveness. The project is based on an online exchange between Italian students enrolled at the University of Padua and international students who will be coming to the University. It differs from many other telecollaboration projects in that it involves different languages, levels of language competence as well as various ways of interaction. Indeed, it implies three different ways of communication among participants: (1) one-to-one partnership in the students’ target language; (2) many-to-many interaction in Italian and/or English/French/Spanish as linguae francae on a Moodle platform and/or in a social <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> area; (3) one-to-many multilingual interaction carried out by e-tutors in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>. They provide students with useful links regarding cultural events and things to do in Padua and its surroundings, as well as recent news and interesting linguistic and cultural issues related to different countries. Mobility, informality, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, reciprocity, friendship, fun and multilingual community are the key words of this initiative whose objectives are aimed at developing linguistic, cultural, personal, social and digital skills in different languages, even in the less used and less taught ones.</p>

<p>The demand of responsibilities among teachers has evolved not only in classroom management but also to the extent of promoting communication and interpersonal skills. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social media</span> is integrated in schools and higher learning institutions for communication and reflection of learning which enhance teachers’ performance in leadership quality and effective teaching. This study was designed in a qualitative approach mainly to explore the extent of interest and enjoyment students experienced during an intensive ICT course. Blog was used as a medium for reflection during the class where students posted their creations of videos, posters and other ICT materials. The three needs investigated were namely <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness support. The researcher further examined on students’ awareness of the usefulness of the ICT skill they learned and how much they can use the blog for teaching and learning. Based on the Basic Psychological Needs Theory framework (BPNT), this study has adopted the direct observation, journal entry, and interviews as a triangulation approach.</p>

<p>The aim of the article is the formation of an innovative model for the commercialization of the services of scientific libraries of research universities in order to increase their financial <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The methodology of the research is based on the use of methods: scientific generalization, systematization, comparison, modelling. The object of research is the activity of scientific libraries of research universities, which strive to vary in the current conditions of rapid technological development. The research results consist of the systematization of the main and secondary functions of scientific libraries of research universities. A new economic category of “digital franchising” has been proposed and characterized as a model of cooperation between the franchisor and the franchisee when the rights to use and represent the company of the franchisor in the intercontinental digital space are transferred. The franchisee has the right to use the company name, services, goods, technological processes, and software of the franchisor to create its own digital network of sub-franchisees and digital products on the basis of the conditions specified in the contract. Such kind of franchising will allow settling relations in a digital <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>space, promptly developing and getting new, yet not completely studied forms. Comparison of traditional and digital models of franchising has allowed to show differences on ten basic criteria: costs for building a network; speed of interaction; level of managerial flexibility; updating of the system; the possibility of expanding the network; financial control; brand management; rate of return; the speed of information about new services; need for operational management. The revealed discrepancies are mainly characterized by different time frames for implementing managerial decisions and excellent approaches to the formation and use of the necessary financial and organizational resources. The author has developed an innovative franchise model, which makes it possible to effectively commercialize the services of scientific libraries. This model is based on the use of franchising by building a broad network of digital services. The peculiarity of digital franchising is revealed, which consists in the essential optimization of expenses for organizing the activities of scientific libraries, in comparison with the traditional model, and speeding up the pace and quality of service. The practical significance of the obtained results lies in new opportunities for pushing a new wave of development of methods for commercializing the services of scientific libraries of research universities and their dissemination at the global level. Using the developed innovative franchise model will be useful for theorists and practitioners engaged in the development of strategies for the development of research universities and their scientific libraries. The main conclusion of the research is that the introduction of a developed marketing tool by talented managers with an entrepreneurial type of thinking will become a source of financial <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for scientific libraries of research universities they manage. Digital expansion in a strategic perspective will absorb all the major information flows that affect the development of the world. Libraries of research universities, as key centres for aggregation and translation of scientific information and knowledge, should be ready for such scenario and already experiment with new tools for the future, which is digital franchising.</p>

<p>In Vietnam, despite the widespread use of computers and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> in the educational settings, little attention has been paid to the role of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> in promoting students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Particularly, in the author’s real teaching context at Thuong Mai University (TMU), there exists a serious problem relating to students’ lack of independency in language learning. The study, therefore, was implemented to investigate the effectiveness of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use in promoting business learners’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and improving their learning skill. To fulfill the study, questionnaires and interviews were conducted to 200 third-year students and 10 teachers of English at TMU respectively. The qualitative approach was adopted to reveal the significant findings of the descriptive case study on the learners’ positive attitudes and awareness of their learning <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> through the popularity yet ineffective use of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use but the ineffective use of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> in improving English study and motivation, what and how teachers and learners do to promote learners’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in language learning. The study, consequently, came up with some effective pedagogical implications that may help teachers recognize the significant role of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> in enhancing learners’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> inside and outside the class.</p>

The experimental group utilised their own <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> features and applications (dictionaries, WhatsApp, camera, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> search engines, notes, and recorders) to employ the social strategies of asking for clarification and correction, cooperating and empathising with others inside and outside the classroom for 12 weeks whereas the control group learned using the traditional methods. The findings of the study revealed that the employment of social strategies mediated by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> features and applications promoted the learners’ socio-culturally autonomous learning characteristics of interaction, interdependence, self-regulation, self-worth, mutual support, and understating in EFL reading context. It is recommended strategy use training programmes and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s integration in language learning should be highly considered in curricula design, teaching and learning methods, training programmes in order to empower learners to take more responsible roles in the learning of EFL reading skills.</p>

<p>Purpose of the study. The purpose of the study is the problem of forming a knowledge model of a specialist with higher education that is a part of an educational project. Its relevance is related to the need for an adequate response to strengthening the scientific and technological progress dynamics and the transition to the information interactions economy in the current conditions of the higher education system. Materials and methods. The information base of the research includes the laws on education of the Russian Federation, educational standards of higher professional education, scientists’ publications on the issues under investigation. The study used the following methods: system analysis, active systems theory, reflexive control theory, and modeling. Results. The research analyzes the consequences of Russia’s entry into the Bologna Convention on education. It shows that this event caused the problem of efficiency and quality of training specialists, as well as the problem of integrating higher education institutions into a new social and economic system related to their adaptation to market relations. According to the principle of institutional <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, solution of these problems is the responsibility of universities. The paper shows that the way to solve these problems is to transfer universities to a design and technological type of administration. The most promising form of education project management is the model of information interaction within the framework of active self-developing network expert environments. The elementary part of such an environment is an expert professional, who owns modern telecommunication technologies and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> means. Integration in the natural intelligence network structure forms a collective strategic subject, which is a tool of a knowledge and action synergy in the interaction process. The paper describes the developed structure of the active self-developing network expert environment and two principles of its functioning as an active multi-agent system when forming a specialist knowledge model. It is proposed to consider the construction of specialist’s knowledge model in the context of corporate knowledge management strategies in organizations to increase competitiveness, as the established support systems for organization knowledge lifecycle and specialist’s integral knowledge model are used to integrate strategic corporate tasks with strategic tasks of developing employees’ corporate knowledge. They consider a specialist as an element of a company production system. His purpose is to give a product specified quantitative and qualitative parameters that ensure its competitive advantages. To carry out production activities, a specialist uses a complex of abilities, knowledge and skills that should be considered as models of his production and technological activities. At each moment, this complex should be considered as a subjective model of its production and technological activity. This creates a basis for a university self-development process by involving advanced consumers using network technologies in the innovative process of improving educational services, receiving ideas or content by referring to their creative abilities in exchange for a reward that corresponds to a contribution. The paper proposes a system that provides a direction for finding solutions and ideas, as well as filtering, summarizing information, determining its value and prospects. It is shown that the method of improving the quality of solutions on an educational project is the synthesis of crowdsourcing technologies, network expertise and the methodology of the active systems theory. Conclusions. The proposed approach allows considering the process of extracting new ideas and knowledge when forming a specialist’s knowledge model as an active system with heterogeneous agents with a counter way of sharing information and active influence of the center in the form of queries to obtain reflexive estimates. It also allows ensuring the interaction of universities and an organization in managing their intellectual capital.</p>

<p>Normative documents of the European Union in the field of education and science are analyzed, including the EU Framework Program for updated key competencies and establishment of&nbsp; European Qualifications Framework for lifelong education.&nbsp; The need to combine education within the lifelong learning process at all levels, the definition of processes, strategies and plans concerning youth, employment, social integration and research policies in this area is determined. The importance of ensuring the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of universities in the development of curricula and the choice of forms of education, promotion of the development of general competencies is stated. Basic requirements of the Strategy for a reasonable, sustainable and comprehensive growth of Europe 2020 are named, results of research on knowledge, skills and competences of future specialists demanded by Europe in 2030 and further are presented. The key trends of the EU policy in the field of education and culture, the EU “Erasmus +” program and Ukraine’s participation in the EU “Eastern Partnership” initiative, improvement of intercultural understanding, civic participation and ethical awareness, as well as ensuring equitable access to higher education in a united and inclusive society are determined. Worldwide, including the European Higher Education Area, experience of solving educational problems has confirmed the thesis about the importance of integrating competencies of all types, as each of them contributes to a successful life in a knowledge-based society. It is summed up that general knowledge of languages, education, ability to quantitative thinking and awareness in the field of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies is the necessary basis for learning, and education for the sake of knowledge includes the whole educational activity. &nbsp;Measures are identified and the goals for ensuring comprehensive and sustainable development, social cohesion and further enhancement of the democratic culture of the European Union countries are set out. In order to progressively develop the European Higher Education Area, it is necessary to intensify interdisciplinary and cross-border cooperation, as well as to develop inclusive and innovative approaches to learning and teaching</p>

<p>Abstract The benefit of reviewing personal feedback to students’ learning of clinical communication skills is well researched. Less is known about the factors that related to students’ engagement in reviewing non-compulsory online feedback, and ways to motivate their behavioural engagement. In this paper, we reported two studies in which medical students completed assessed clinical video conferencing consultations with human simulated patients via an online training platform that also provided automated and human feedback for students. In Study 1, three days after the consultation, an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> with different instructional styles (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive, controlling or control) was sent to different groups reminding students to review their feedback. In Study 2, up to three repetitions of the same, either <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive or controlling, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s were sent to students. Results of Study 1 revealed that students who reviewed feedback before receiving <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s achieved higher assessment results and reported higher degree of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to participate in the training program than the remaining students. However, the different instructional styles of the single <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> in this study did not significantly influence the students’ engagement differently. Study 2 results revealed that students who received controlling <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s displayed higher engagement than students who received <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s. Findings suggested that multiple factors might influence students’ engagement in reviewing their online feedback, and this study provided evidences of the effects of using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s to motivate students to review the feedback.</p>

<p>Higher education institutions at the international level have seen the need to adopt and integrate <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies to meet the opportunities and challenges of innovation in teaching and learning processes. This logic has led to the implementation of virtual learning environments called ‘Learning Management Systems’, the functionalities of which support flexible and active learning under a constructivist approach. This study measured didactic and technological use of Moodle and its implications in teaching from a quantitative approach by administering a questionnaire to a sample of 640 higher education teachers. Some guiding questions were as follows: Are teachers using the Moodle platform for didactic purposes? What strategies, resources and tools are teachers using, and what do they contribute to student-centred teaching? Are teaching strategies that are focused on collaboration, interaction and student <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> promoted? The results coincide with those of other studies, confirming an instrumental and functional use of the platform, which is mainly being used as a repository for materials and information, while its pedagogical use remains limited. This is becoming a problem in higher education institutions, something that requires debate and reflection from a systemic perspective on the adoption and integration of technology in the classroom.</p>

<p>Nowadays, the rapid development of information technology has increasingly penetrated into all walks of society and even people’s lives. With the development of education informatization, traditional teaching can’t meet the needs of talents in the new era. Developing a new teaching mode by integrating <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>, big data and traditional teaching has become the main theme of contemporary education. This paper studies the connotation of educational informatization and Blended Teaching theory and puts forward the Blended Teaching mode of College English by improving teachers’ informationized teaching ability, constructing the diversified teaching platform, and setting up informationized teaching resource base, adopting different teaching methods and strategies, so as to improve students’ enthusiasm and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in College English learning and enhance the effect of College English teaching.</p>

<p>This paper presents the result of the pilot project of an out-of-class; it is the making of a news program with 20-25 minutes duration. The pilot project took place at UIN Malulana Malik Ibrahim Malang; it was conducted benefitted from the familiarity of the young people toward <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. The aims of this task were to promote the students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> learning by giving them the opportunities to practice their speaking skill, building up their self-confidence, and challenging their creativity. Therefore, the questionnaire, as the self-reflection feedback, consisted of three questions; whether the making of news program gives them the opportunities to practice their speaking skill, builds up their confidence, and challenges their creativity. There were 30 students involved in this pilot project. The result of data analysis showed that most of the participants strongly agreed the making a new program give them a chance to practice their speaking skill, build up their self-confidence, and challenge their creativity. Therefore, making a news program can be an out-of-speaking class activity in order to promote the students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> learning.</p>

<p>This paper examines the influences of professional development activities on important teacher-level factors that are important for the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>y (ICT) in education for primary school teachers in Mongolia. The study utilizes the survey data collected in 2012 (n = 826) and 2016 (n = 1161) to identify the changes in factors that are important to the use of ICT in education. The study result shows that six teacher level factors that are important for the ICT integration have been improved over time through professional development activities. These are professional competency in educational use of ICT, collaboration for ICT integration, benefits on use of ICT, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to innovate, recognition as a professional, and skills and practices in educational use of ICT. This provides supporting evidence to educational practitioners for the implementation of effective professional development programs to promote ICT integration in education, especially in the developing country’s context.</p>

<p>Abstract A growing body of research has examined the relations of dispositions toward <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) to science achievement among adolescent students. However, there is little research exploring the associations between ICT-related dispositions and science-related dispositions among adolescent students. Therefore, this study, employing a self-determination theory perspective, investigated the relationships of perceived competence in ICT usage and perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> related to ICT usage with dispositions toward science—enjoyment of science, interest in broad science topics, science self-efficacy, and epistemological beliefs about science—among 258,192 adolescent students from 10,767 schools in 42 PISA 2015 participating countries. Results of multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) analyses, after accounting for student-, school-, and country-level demographic characteristics, indicated that students’ perceived competence in ICT usage and perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> related to ICT usage were significantly positively related to their enjoyment of science, interest in broad science topics, science self-efficacy, and epistemological beliefs about science. Further, the results of the study revealed that students’ perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> related to ICT usage was more strongly associated with their dispositions toward science than perceived competence in ICT usage. Implications of the findings for policy and practice are discussed.</p>

<p>The present study investigates some factors affecting college students’ tendency to use <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> for different educational purposes. We reached 120 participants who were college students. Our sample comprised of 63 (52.5%) females and 57 (47.5%) males. We applied convenience sampling technique and an online questionnaire to collect data. Descriptive statistics, multiple regression analysis, and Structural Equation Modelling using IBM SPSS AMOS were utilized. The findings provide that GPA, Personal Use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> for Studying and Socialization, <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> Psychological Need, and Academic Procrastination foresee college students’ willingness to use <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> in their courses.

<p>The present study investigated the factor structure of and measurement invariance in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) engagement construct, and the relationship between ICT engagement and students’ performance on science, mathematics and reading in China and Germany. Samples were derived from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2015 survey. Configural, metric and scalar equivalence were found in a multigroup exploratory structural equation model. In the regression model, a significantly positive association between interest in ICT and student achievement was found in China, in contrast to a significantly negative association in Germany. All achievement scores were negatively and significantly correlated with perceived ICT competence scores in China, whereas science and mathematics achievement scores were not predicted by scores on ICT competence in Germany. Similar patterns were found in China and Germany in terms of perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in using ICT and social relatedness in using ICT to predict students’ achievement. The implications of all the findings were discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The present work presents an example of using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Computer-Mediated</span> Communication (CMC) in Foreign Language Teaching (FLT) with the aim to increase students’ hours of exposure to English as a Foreign Language (EFL). Since class time is sometimes limited, it is necessary to look for reinforcement tasks for students to properly develop literacy and communication skills. In addition, CMC is considered by scholars a new variety of language, with its own features and rules, one that students must master as well as other traditional language varieties. As secondary goals, this project intended to develop students’ motivation, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, linguistic awareness and cooperative learning. By using a Mobile <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Instant Mess</span>aging (MIM) application, Remind, students were encouraged to communicate in groups and, thereby, supplement hours of practicing the foreign language outside the classroom, without limitation of time and space. Students evaluated the task by means of an online questionnaire and results proved to be positive, showing that they enjoyed the activity and considered it useful and effective. Moreover, they realised the importance of cooperative learning, of responsibility and of being aware of their own learning process. Likewise, the real and authentic purpose of communication enhanced motivation among students.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>This article examines factors of successful use of faculty-led short-term study abroad programs as a teaching strategy in promoting cultural humility among undergraduate social work students. Key attributes that influence improved cultural awareness in social work students are detailed, including the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> prior to, during and after travel abroad. Undergraduate social work students (n=8) participated in a summer course including travel to Costa Rica. Description of the teaching techniques and strategies are described pre-travel, in-country and post-travel. Two measures are described given to students pre-travel and post-travel to assess cultural flexibility, adaptability, openness and personal <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. These include the Cross Cultural Adaptability Inventory (CCAI) and the Short Term Study Abroad Survey. Results included all of the students reporting a change in their world view, attitude changes as a result of in- home stays, and agency visits. There was a significant difference on the CCAI on the Personal <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> subscale.</p>

<p>Teachers have a central role in fostering learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and their views regarding LA are essential. They should maintain the learning environment and activities to support LA. This research aimed to find out teachersâ€™ attitudes towards their roles and learning practices to support LA. A questionnaire was administered to 19 teachers who are studying for a Masters degree at UPI. It is found that teachers rated their responsibilities in choosing classroom activities and evaluating studentsâ€™ progress at the highest point. However, they viewed studentsâ€™ decision making abilities in choosing learning objectives and evaluating their learning at the lowest score. Furthermore, the activities which teachers often recommended to are listen to English songs, read books and use the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>. It can be concluded that teachers have a strong belief towards their roles in LA. Even though they are already conscious about the importance of LA, it should be implemented into practice.</p>

<p>The use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y greatly improved foreign languages teaching and learning. Learning management systems, such as Moodle, used to create and deliver courses, facilitate e-learning in different types of educational institutions. Blended learning as a combination of face-to face and e-learning is conducive to deep learning. We designed a new course “Teaching English as a foreign language to learners with special educational needs” to provide students enrolled in a master’s programme – pre-service English teachers, with an opportunity to enhance their language and professional skills as well as to develop their learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> through meaningful learning experiences blending learning can supplement. We considered micro, meso and macro levels of the course implementation and functioning. In this paper we describe the context in which the course is introduced by providing information about the setting, the curriculum, the need for including this course in the master’s programme at the faculty of foreign languages. We also outline the way the course is designed, including its structure, particular tasks and assessment procedures and present students’ feedback about the impact of the course on their foreign language skills and learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The results indicate that blended learning is an effective tool for development of pre-service teachers’ English language skills and learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.

<p>This article reflects on the insights of higher education teachers about the role that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICT) can have in enhancing students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the teaching and learning process. In order to accomplish this goal, it was necessary to build a theoretical framework that explored the context of higher education under the assumptions of the Bologna process and educative policies, exploring the encouragement to students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and the use of ICT in the teaching and learning process. A quantitative exploratory approach was adopted with the purpose of collecting the insights of teachers involved in two courses of the Portuguese public higher education. The data collection was made through the curricular plans and though a survey to the teachers. With this research, we conclude that teachers reveal efforts to enhance students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and feel motivated to use ICT in their educational practices. The most frequently mentioned motivations are that ICT facilitates the access to resources and information, innovates their practice, improves the regulation, tutoring and intervention, and in interaction and communication. Teachers also appear to hold positive perceptions on the potential of ICT to support their teaching and learning process, especially the perception of utility and ease of use of ICT.</p>

<p>Educational research is increasingly paying attention to students’ out-of-class learning. Students’ out-of-class learning is linked to improved class performance and constitutes an important part of learner development. Prior research has argued that learning-resources provision should encourage students’ autonomous learning both in and out of the classroom [Benson, 2013; Benson &amp; Reinders, 2011; Gardner &amp; Miller, 1999; Little, 1997; Richards, 2015]. However, work on <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> often proceeds via generalities rather than focusing on its enactment in individual behavior. Accordingly, this study investigated 35 EFL undergraduates’ autonomous learning behaviors and their use of resources of the learning center of a university. Data were collected via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> interviews with the participants and examination of their resources-usage records. Content analysis of the interview data, using six categories based on a learner-<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> model, was used to generate each participant’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> score. Spearman rho testing of the relationship between those scores and the students’ resources-usage scores suggested a very strong positive relationship between autonomous learning behaviors and overall usage of resources, as well as the variety of those resources used by individuals. Data analysis also revealed that, to varying degrees, each participant’s autonomous-learning behaviors (based on qualitative examples) fell into more than one of the six learner-<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> types. Based on these findings, it is recommended that students be encouraged to learn beyond the classroom through pedagogical activities that link classroom learning to learning-center resources. Based on the findings of this study we make suggestions on pedagogical design with SAC and applications for SACs in other educational contexts.</p>

<p>The combined trends of learner-centred teaching and ubiquitous technology use in the classroom have given instructors a unique opportunity to support students in developing lifelong learning skills. Heutagogy (or self-determined learning) provides a promising framework for capitalizing on these developing trends, drawing on established learner-centred education theories that strongly emphasize learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The key principles of heutagogy – learner agency, self-efficacy and capability, reflection and metacognition, and non-linear learning – provide a foundation for designing and developing learning ecologies, the potential of which can be further maximized through the use of digital media. This article describes the theory of heutagogy and the learner-centred pedagogies on which the theory is founded, as well as providing an explanation of the pedagogy-andragogy-heutagogy (PAH) continuum and its use in developing student skills. It also explores the role of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> in supporting the development of those skills.</p>

<p>Nursing has not yet received full social recognition and in general the public opinion does not have a completely positive perception of it, which regards it as an auxiliary profession to the medical profession. This study aims to investigate the image of the nurse among year 4 and 5 high school students.Two groups of students were interviewed, one at their institution without any previous orientation (n = 102) and one at the University of Bologna during orientation day (n = 388). A validated questionnaire (Nursing Attitude Questionnaire) of 30 items was delivered. Two additional questions were added to explore the possibility of advising relatives and acquaintances to become a nurse and therefore to choose the nursing degree course.All areas of the NAQ scored significantly higher in the group where students attended the orientation day, especially the ones related to the professional role, stereotypes and professional value items. Female students ≥ 21 had a more positive image of the nurse. Both groups recognized that nurses are important figures for patients and that they are intelligent people, who must have a degree in order to carry out their work duties. Differences between the groups were recorded. Students in group 1 did not accept nursing <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> while students in group 2 understood differences between nursing and medical careers, attributing to them the same value. A positive correlation between the positive image of the nursing profession and the interest in becoming nurses or advising others to undertake the nursing course was found. In conclusion, orientation is effective in helping high school students in the choice of their university courses. Regarding nursing, strategies to improve the image of the nurse and enrollment should be combined during orientation day with current up to date communication and learning tools, such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and simulation laboratories. Furthermore, it appears increasingly important to extend orientation and tutoring activities to junior high school students, families and teachers.</p>

<p>The popularity of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) has had a significant influence on the reading proficiency of early adolescents. Achieving excellent reading proficiency, which is related not only to a student’s inherent talent but also to various impact factors, can greatly enhance the effectiveness of reading education. The Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2015 provides an international view on the reading proficiency of 15-year-olds in a computer-based testing environment. In this study, a multiple linear regression model was constructed using the computing language R to investigate the association between student-level ICT impact factors (the availability of ICT, the use of ICT and attitudes toward ICT) and reading proficiency among early adolescents. The sample included 37,155 15-year-olds from five representative countries with extremely high reading proficiency. The results showed that the students’ ICT-related attitudinal factors concerning their interest in ICT and perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in using ICT, rather than ICT availability and ICT use, were closely associated with high reading proficiency. In addition, ICT devices should be integrated not only as instructional media but also as a cognitive tool for teaching reading with timely and appropriate scrutiny.</p>

<p>Distance education requires an instructional design approach that can lead to educational transformation. This is characterised by advanced flexibility, learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and extensive use of digital technologies to enhance learning outcomes. The main feature of such methodology is the physical distance between teaching staff, peers and educational institutions. Various technological tools are used to bridge this distance and improve communication and interaction. This article attempts to review the literature in the field, with the aim of highlighting strategies for enhancing communication and interaction in online learning environments. After discussing the theoretical framework for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communication</span> and interaction, the authors outline the factors involved in creating well-structured, interactive and dynamic online courses and programmes for higher education students. The article explores the multi-dimensional aspects of communication in online learning environments and the differing forms of interaction involved. Using qualitative methods, the authors’ aim is to produce a framework to help tutors and instructional designers develop more effective online courses in higher education. In addition, this article may be of value to researchers and scholar-practitioners interested in communication issues, to online learning designers, and to institutional managers recruiting teaching staff for online educational courses.</p>

<p>Learning how to speak English might be challenging in a distance education program, due to its necessity of methodological adaptations to those who teach, as well as to the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> necessary to those who learn. This work aimed at investigating how the Virtual University Institute (UFC Virtual), connected to the Federal University of Ceara in partnership with The Open University of Brazil (UAB), enables licentiate degree students to learn how to speak English. The corpus of this research is the English Language – Oral Production and Oral Comprehension course, offered during the third term of the undergraduate program, between March and May 2018. In this qualitative study, we develop a participant observation, accessing the website Solar, a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE), in order to analyze which resources were available for students to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> between them and with their tutor. We verify which type of interactions were offered in the platform: synchronous (communication in real time); asynchronous (learning opportunities that can be accessed at any time); or multi-synchronous (combining the two forms of delivery). We exam, as well, the scripts provided during the speaking tasks, aiming at identifying if the students would practice authentic conversations, or if they would repeat previous formulated phrases. The results show that the learners did not have opportunities to communicate in real time at a distance English learning environment from Solar, nor to receive corrections or synchronic feedback from the tutor. We also confirm that the scripted tasks could allow the students to not engage in spontaneous dialogues.</p>

<p>This article addresses perceptions that higher education teachers have on the integration of technology in evaluation processes, focusing on their beliefs about learning, evaluation and technology that enable or hinder this pedagogical innovation. This study considered teachers as part of a project using rubrics in Moodle to evaluate learning in a Chilean higher education institution in 2014, 2015 and 2016. Forming and evaluating in a competency-based approach involves challenges for the teaching staff and changes in their role that are accepted or resisted. The same happens in the face of innovation processes with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICT) integration in teaching practices. The primary results show a relationship between pedagogical beliefs and evaluation which is consistent with adoption and assessment of the digital tool used. In addition, it reveals the role of beliefs as secondary barriers to change in the face of access or primary barriers (Ertmert, 1999). The value of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in student work and feedback are identified as key beliefs in technology adoption.</p>

<p>Abstract To date, autonomous shipping appears to primarily have been about a technology push rather than considering and providing sociotechnical solutions including re-design of work, capturing knowledge and addressing human factors in modern shipping. Autonomous shipping is frequently claimed to reduce human error, whereas in reality, any issue connected to humans will arguably move with the people from ship to shore in that different people will make different mistakes; with possibly more severe consequences. Furthermore, autonomous shipping is likely to require changes to regulation and increased attention to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> security and other IT human-centred quality factors if it is to succeed. What the HUMANE project is interested in is how (in certain scenarios) the human collaborates with, hands over to, or takes over from the technology/automation to achieve an overall safe state of the system. The aim is to map and investigate a potential gap between current human skills, training and education and an autonomous maritime future, and to provide insight to enable mitigating change. The main project method is expert workshops, performed in a focus group style. Four workshops are planned and to date (mid 2019), two have been performed. The topic of the first was technology, and the second was legal, class and insurance implications. For this paper, we have analysed the data relevant to future skills. Results show that not only is the skill set imagined to be needed very different from that of today, it also contains many contradictory elements and, occasionally, demands for abilities that humans do not possess, and are unlikely to evolve.</p>

<p>&lt;span&gt;Education in Mexico has not evolved in the way it is taught and evaluated. In the historical moment that postmodernism enters, it has not been possible to adapt to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=“IN”&gt; <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=“IN”&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ICT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=“IN”&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, or rapid technological innovation, or changes and trends in the industry, to the sharing economy or the rise of distance races. In its analysis, an essential deficiency is detected in the current education models, and it is detected that educational freedom is nil or scarce, which has led to poor student performance, high youth unemployment, which cause severe social problems and the economy of the economy. The current government is working closely with the private sector to connect education and promote employment. It is necessary to grant public schools more <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, freedom and responsibility. This paper explains how to act so that Mexico can adapt education 4.0 with solid steps to reach society 5.0.&lt;/span&gt;</p>

<p>Abstract Facilitating a collaborative community in an online class takes a delicate balance of technology and personal communication. This article explores the use of asynchronous tools, including threaded discussions, announcements, and personal <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s to create and maintain a high-touch online classroom. The resulting course structure both increases student <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and enhances instructor efficacy. Introduction In fall 2003, I accepted a position that required me to adapt a core professional and technical writing course at the University of Wyoming (UW) to a virtual classroom. As an instructor for the only baccalaureate-degree-granting institution in Wyoming–a large, rural state with significant economic and educational diversity–I was used to serving a broad population with diverse learning styles and needs. Furthermore, I knew that although the technologies and processes in Web-based instruction provide flexibility for the distance learner, they also can produce specific challenges (DeTure 21). Nevertheless, I was unprepared for the glut of individual communications and the volume of personal attention my would require. Since then, I have developed the use of asynchronous tools to limit the repetitive, individual communications that overwhelmed me during my early semesters teaching online. Instead of relying on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> for mass communication, for example, I now use the course platform’s built-in Announcements tool. I also rely heavily on the materials posted on the course website and on students’ expertise with online learning in my responses to individual student inquiries. Finally, I continue building infrastructure into my course Home area. I have dubbed the resulting online course, which relies heavily on student-teacher and student-student communication, high-tech, high-touch. On the following pages, I discuss the development and application of these techniques. After a brief review of current literature and research into online teaching and learning, I contextualize my discussion by introducing course strategies and objectives. Next, I briefly overview the course platform, and finally, I discuss how I have used asynchronous tools, including threaded discussions, announcements, and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> both to facilitate community in the online classroom and to manage my teaching time more efficiently. Background In February 2004, the Conference on Composition and Communication (CCCC) issued a position statement identifying numerous best practices for faculty teaching writing and composition in the online environment. According to these guidelines, successful online instruction encourages contacts between student and faculty, develops reciprocity and cooperation among students, and uses active learning techniques (Yancey et al., par. 15). Indeed, as Cheng-Chang Pen and Michael Sullivan assert, communication is always a top priority in an online [teaching] environment (par. 1). In College Students’ Perceptions of Quality in Distance Education: The Importance of Communication, Madeline Ortiz-Rodriguez et al.&nbsp;affirm this assertion: Students related quality in with the following features: interaction between and instructors, and between and students; timely feedback from instructors; and availability and accessibility of teaching assistants, facilitators, professors, help staff, and technical staff (101). Communication in the online environment, however, is unlike the spontaneous that takes place in a physical classroom. Although course management systems (CMS) include synchronous tools, such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> rooms and white boards, as Alvin Wang and Michael Newlin explain, most Web-based courses rely primarily on asynchronous to deliver course information to students (par. 1). Furthermore, the very nature of online creates expectations of constant and immediate availability of faculty. …</p>

<p>The paper explores the issues and challenges of the affiliation system in Indian higher education system. India has the one of the largest system of higher education in the world with 33,023 institutes (UGC,2012) compared with 6,742 in the US and 4,297 in China(FICCI, E&amp;Y Report, 2011). However in terms of quality only one Indian university, IIT Bombay (317th rank) appear in top 400 universities of the world according to Times Higher Education 2012. Several committees and experts have argued that affiliation system needs to be reformed to reduce the burden on affiliating universities and improve quality. Reforming affiliation system requires an alternative which promotes <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, innovation, and better management. The paper concludes with recommendations for promoting clusters, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT), reducing political influence, autonomous colleges and streamlining regulatory framework.</p>

<p>Teachers at all stages of their careers need to engage in lifelong learning to keep abreast with the changing and challenging pedagogical environment. The purpose of the study is to find out how informal learning helps experienced English teachers teaching non-English majors in a Chinese university to keep professional development in an age of web 2.0. A survey was conducted firstly to find out the status quo and the need of foreign language teachers’ professional development followed by in-depth interviews to elicit informal learning activities from three experienced English teachers. The study points to the changes in teachers’ informal learning activities in the new era of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and emerging technologies, characterized by the wide use of online learning resources, online learning communities and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s in addition to seeking help from colleagues.

<p>Purpose The emergence of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> has provided an alternative mechanism for students to provide and access online reviews about universities. These forms of feedback are often not systematically monitored and interpreted by universities. The purpose of this paper is to analyse quantitative ratings and qualitative comments provided by students via Google reviews of 40 Australian universities. The qualitative comments were analysed via thematic coding which identified four key themes including quality of teaching, course design, learning environment and administrative support. The data were also subjected to automated content analysis using the text analytics software Leximancer to enhance the objectivity and reliability of findings. Design/methodology/approach The study involved the extraction of quantitative ratings as well as qualitative comments from Google reviews of 40 Australian universities. Each university was searched on Google and their rating and comments were collected as of August 2019. The qualitative data were included in an Excel spreadsheet along with the name of the universities, and their quantitative ratings. Using thematic coding techniques, the qualitative data were manually coded into four themes: quality of teaching, course design, learning environment and administrative support. Furthermore, the qualitative comments were grouped into two categories: positive comments and negative comments. Findings The paper argues the need for universities to actively monitor these new forms of student feedback which have provided <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and freedom for students and other stakeholders to access and provide 24/7 feedback. The study found common themes emerging from the positive and negative student comments related to: quality of teaching, course design, learning environments and administrative support. These aspects contributed to the students’ satisfaction levels when they reflected on their educational experience on Google reviews. The study also found that institutions with high numbers of negative comments tend to have lower ratings compared to those with positive comments. Research limitations/implications The study did not use other learning analytic tools to measure and assess the feedback from students using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and other forms of feedback. Originality/value Many studies have been undertaken on student experience. Studies have focussed on the experience of home and international students, on-campus and online students, and students from various underrepresented backgrounds. So far no study has been undertaken on the reviews provided by students using Google reviews.</p>

<p>With the introduction of more modern instructional practices, the traditional approach to learning and teaching is becoming ever more obsolete. Education practitioners all over the world have been calling for educational institutions, in both developed and developing countries, to improve pedagogical practices as a means of significantly enhancing learner experiences and outcomes in the learning-teaching process. There is evidence that rapid technological changes are taking place in the educational landscape and that the utilisation of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies in the instructional process is becoming more and more mandatory. Bearing in mind the afore-mentioned, the objective of this discussion is to underscore the place of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies in curriculum design and development. The focus of this discussion and review of literature is on curriculum and what it entails, the importance of curriculum, curriculum design and development, and ICTs and curriculum design and development (which looks at learning theories and ICT-based curricula, integration of ICTs into educational curricula, integration of ICTs into foreign language curricula, and the need for ICT-based curricula). Special consideration is given to ICT-based foreign language curricula because of the increasing importance of language didactics and foreign language education today. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies should be considered and integrated into educational curricula because they can revolutionise instructional practices and stimulate pedagogical innovation; foster learner engagement; cater for student learning diversity; promote learner independence and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>; increase learner interaction and communication, and support intellectual expressiveness and creativity of learners, application, and lifelong learning.</p>

<p>The article is devoted to the theoretical substantiation of the podcasting as the most up-to-date interactive and communicative technology for learning English, determining the essential characteristics and selection criteria from the perspective of teaching a foreign language. It is determined that the podcast is a meaningfully completed and informationally self-sufficient audio file that reflects the characteristics of speech, consciousness and thinking of speakers of a particular language and sociocultural traditions. Due to the analysis of various classifications of podcasts, some scientists have established that there is no generally accepted classification. The complexity of their classification lies in the fact that there are many criterias by which we can classify podcasts in accordance with: 1) the purpose of use; 2) the level of language training of the target audience; 3) the study of individual sections of linguistics; 4) topics; 5) genres. It is proved that the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> technology of podcasting is based on the basics of technical and didactic characteristics: authenticity, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (distance), relevance, formation of competence in the field of media and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> technologies, interactivity, performance and use of a mobile technical device outside the school. The key point in the selection of podcasts is the definition and justification of the relevant linguistic criteria (phonetic, lexical and grammatical).</p>

<p>Working from the perspective of open and online learning for widening participation in higher education, this article advances a new conceptual model to guide practitioners and researchers in maximising the enablers and minimising the constraints to foundation level online learning for equity students. The model is adapted from technology for social inclusion research addressing persistent inequalities in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use. First, the proposed model is introduced with definitions for the six dimensions (course purpose, technology, social support, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, learning materials and skills) and research propositions for how the dimensions enable and constrain learning. A qualitative synthesis of empirically tested open and online programs (including massive open online courses) is used to clarify how the six critical dimensions interact to enable and constrain diverse learners in distance and blended modes. Results support the model with new definitions for each dimension in light of unexpected findings: courses designed to enable particular groups; breadth of learner supports; technology amplifying other dimensions; and aspects of the model designed to empower disadvantaged learners. This model should assist course design research and practice at higher education institutions where open and online provision for diverse and educationally disadvantaged learners is the current or approaching reality.</p>

<p>The aim of the article is to present an analysis of the assessment of the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) in conventional textbooks for teaching English. After presenting the theoretical framework of the new core curriculum in terms of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and ICT application, the study describes the way in which ICT tools are integrated or ignored in current English textbooks. The study covered textbooks used in the seventh grade of primary school. Six of the eight (one per publisher) textbooks available on the market were selected for this purpose. Qualitative research comprised a thorough evaluation of tasks which comprised explicit references to ICT. The quality of the analysed didactic materials was determined by the potential level of supporting students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> by using the coursebook tasks in question, measured through a specially designed Likert scale. The conclusions served to propose changes and improvements to these textbooks.</p>

<p>The technological characteristics of today’s society have favored the inclusion of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) and the emergence of new training methodologies in educational spaces. This study addresses flipped learning as an innovative approach in the teaching and learning processes of physical education at two educational stages, primary and secondary education. The objective of this study is to analyze the effectiveness of flipped learning with respect to traditional methodology. A descriptive and correlational experimental research design was used through a quantitative perspective. Two study groups were established, one control (traditional methodology) and one experimental (flipped learning) in each educational stage. A total of 119 students from an educational center in Ceuta (Spain) participated. These participants were chosen intentionally. The data were collected through a questionnaire. The results show that the experimental group obtained better evaluations in the academic indicators, highlighting the motivation, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and interactions between the different agents. Regarding the effectiveness of flipped learning according to the educational stage, its potential was demonstrated in both stages, highlighting a significant improvement in <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in secondary education.</p>

<p>The main purpose of this review is to present why and how <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> can be applied in language teaching and learning, as seen from the point of view of practitioners. Vygotskian constructionism has provided the theoretical framework for the investigation. The wide availability of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and their high penetration rate are seen as key advantages. The stress has been put on the fact that such platforms enable users to interact with others and acquire the target language in their own community of practice. The learning process, thus, gets enriched by both individual and collaborative dimensions. Negotiation of meaning, as well as the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in creating one’s new identity and customizing the study content, become crucial aspects of the experience. Assuming accountability for one’s own learning results in increased intrinsic motivation to bridge the gap between the current level of knowledge and the desired proficiency level. Finally, certain features of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> that allow instructors to use them in class are discussed.</p>

<p>Abstract On long-duration space missions, skill retention and generalizability become ever more important as mission length increases, for it is through these capabilities that astronaut crews achieve <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Because simulators are used extensively in all types of training, the effects of simulator fidelity on skill retention and generalizability are paramount to understand. A literature survey was performed to identify current research gaps in skill retention and generalizability. The survey identified a need for a structured and quantifiable approach to characterize skill decay, for example, using a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netic approach. Such an approach would allow for gaining a deeper understanding of the mechanisms through which skill decay operates. Furthermore, the literature survey identified three research gaps and opportunities for future research: (1) developing skill decay functions provides theoretical insights into skill decay and could allow for several practical applications, such as planning refresher training, (2) investigating the effects of simulator fidelity on skill decay functions could allow for better simulator utilization during training, and (3) investigating the generalizability of skills learned in initial training to other tasks could provide space crews with greater <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.</p>

<p>Over the past decade, the issue of uncontrolled growth of unsystematic information in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> has remained acute for the scientific community. The problem of finding relevant information related to the distribution and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of scientific information resources remains. A priority in the field of centralized access to the key scientifically significant sources of information is the creation of a united information space (UIS). The study aims to identify the main models to form systems integrating distributed information resources, and as a result to determine the structure of UIS formation in a research library. Two models were considered and analyzed in the study: a meta-aggregator and an integrated electronic library. During the analysis, elements, structure and a set of functions for users and employees of a research library are revealed for each model. The study allowed the drawing of the following conclusions: • The choice of a model for the UIS formation depends mostly on the formulation of tasks, the solution of which is the purpose of creating a system, as well as on the technological potential of the organizations involved in the process. •Multifunctionality of the system allows simultaneous use of the above-mentioned formation models. • Adding the element of interactivity to the structure of UIS of the research library will allow timely monitoring of changes in the information needs of scientists, reduction of time, labor and financial costs of both the library and a user. The article presents the criteria for choosing a model. For the first time the optimal effective structure of the UIS in the research library is described.</p>

<p>English speaking proficiency requires more than knowing its grammatical and semantic rules. It also includes the knowledge of how native speakers of one language use the language in the context of structures of interpersonal exchange in which many factors interact. In this study, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> was implemented by journal or diary writing, sharing and discussing journals, sharing feedback on journals, reflection, promoting dictionary use, introducing useful <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> websites, forming yahoo groups, sharing valuable links, creating online self-access center, watching preferable movies, and goal setting. The present quasi-experimental study aimed to investigate the impact of teaching <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> on the speaking skill of Iranian EFL learners. To this end, 44 male and female intermediate students at Respina Talk (i.e., Iran-Canada) language school with the age range of 20-35 were selected in order to achieve the objectives of the study. According to the obtained results, there was a significant relationship between teaching <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and EFL learners’ speaking skill. The findings of this study may have some theoretical and practical implications for material developers, EFL teachers, language learners, etc.</p>

<p>Abstract Previous research on the relationship between students’ home and school <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>y (ICT) resources and academic performance has shown ambiguous results. The availability of ICT resources at school has been found to be unrelated or negatively related to academic performance, whereas the availability of ICT resources at home has been found to be both positively and negatively related to academic performance. In addition, the frequency of use of ICT is related to students’ academic achievement. This relationship has been found to be negative for ICT use at school, however, for ICT use at home the literature on the relationship with academic performance is again ambiguous. In addition to ICT availability and ICT use, students’ attitudes towards ICT have also been found to play a role in student performance. In the present study, we examine how availability of ICT resources, students’ use of those resources (at school, outside school for schoolwork, outside school for leisure), and students’ attitudes toward ICT (interest in ICT, perceived ICT competence, perceived ICT <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>) relate to individual differences in performance on a digital assessment of reading in one comprehensive model using the Dutch PISA 2015 sample of 5183 15-year-olds (49.2% male). Student gender and students’ economic, social, and cultural status accounted for a substantial part of the variation in digitally assessed reading performance. Controlling for these relationships, results indicated that students with moderate access to ICT resources, moderate use of ICT at school or outside school for schoolwork, and moderate interest in ICT had the highest digitally assessed reading performance. In contrast, students who reported moderate competence in ICT had the lowest digitally assessed reading performance. In addition, frequent use of ICT outside school for leisure was negatively related to digitally assessed reading performance, whereas perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> was positively related. Taken together, the findings suggest that excessive access to ICT resources, excessive use of ICT, and excessive interest in ICT is associated with lower digitally assessed reading performance.</p>

<p>This paper explores the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies (ICT) in an educational institution. Its objective is to understand the relationship between students, parents, and teachers when using the digital platform, as well as to verify how each one of them appropriates the technological tool. Reflection is based on the premise that the accelerated pace of technological innovation requires that people increasingly assimilate their potential not only in the business field but also in the scholar communities. More than presenting concepts and theories on ICT (KERCKHOVE, 1995, MACHADO, 2004; VEEN, VRAKKING, 2009; MORAN, 2015, and others), the article carries out an empirical research exercise in which the authors conduct observations to the digital platform of a private school in the city of Taquara (Brazil), besides applying a questionnaire with three parents, three students and one teacher of a 4th-grade class in the same school. This research aims to understand if the classes are more attractive, interactive, collaborative and, especially if there is a greater engagement of parents, students and the teacher due to the possibility of digital connections between them. In short, the results pointed out that the digital platform encourages practices with active methodologies in and outside the classroom (at home). In the universe researched, it was also identified that interactions with digital media encourage student <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, but parents could use it to become more involved in the process of learning with their children.</p>

<p>Digital health technologies such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s present the potential for increased access to care and on-demand services. However, many patients with serious mental illnesses (eg, schizophrenia) have not been offered the digital health training necessary to fully utilize these innovative approaches. To bridge this digital divide in knowledge and skills, we created a hands-on and interactive training program grounded in self-determination theory, technology use cases, and the therapeutic alliance. This article introduces the need and theoretical foundation for and the experience of running the resulting Digital Opportunities for Outcomes in Recovery Services (DOORS) group in the setting of 2 programs: a first-episode psychosis program and a clubhouse for individuals with serious mental illness. The experience of running these 2 DOORS groups resulted in 2 publicly available, free training manuals to empower others to run such groups and adapt them for local needs. Future work on DOORS will expand the curriculum to best support digital health needs and increase equity of access to and knowledge and skills related to technology use in serious mental illness.</p>

<p>The present paper investigated the factors of motivation and the role of teachers in motivating English language learners in the ESP classes of Dhofar University as well as the significance of motivation in teaching and learning through mobile application technology. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Mobile phone</span>s are handy devices that are readily available with all the students in universities and colleges nowadays. Furthermore, the innovative use of mobile applications and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> technology is very common among the undergraduate students. This paper is a detailed description of some of the teaching strategies employed through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s to motivate the students who have very low level of motivation. Since lack of motivation among students is a common challenge faced by most of the ELT teachers in their classrooms, practical solutions centred on mobile applications is the focus of this study. Furthermore, supplementing classroom practices with mobile application technology can promote learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and peer learning opportunities within the classroom resulting in a visible rise in the motivational graph of the whole class. This paper is also a practical account of how mobile applications can be integrated into classroom teaching without affecting the traditional syllabus of a conventional university curriculum.</p>

<p>The continuous advancement in technology has transformed physical learning platforms into digital spaces in higher education. In Malaysia, instructors and students are gradually adopting the e-learning or blended-learning approach by using online discussion forums (e.g.&nbsp;BlackBoard) or <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s (e.g.&nbsp;<span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> groups) to engage students’ participation in courses and encourage self-directed learning. This study presents a qualitative view of students’ perception of engaging in online discussion forums in a synchronous learning environment, and their views on the positive and negative aspects of using online discussion forums for learning. Results indicate that students perceive <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and sense of belongingness in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>y as main factors that influence their voluntary and active participation in the online discussion forums. Technical challenges remain as a key factor in determining students’ interests to utilize online discussion forums for learning. While future research is needed to assess the sentiments of Malaysian students in online learning, this study was intended to provide Malaysian instructors and higher education institutions a preview on the sentiments of students towards online learning to better improve the aspects of technical, pedagogical methods and policies for online learning as the nation moves towards Education 4.0.</p>

<p>Purpose : Limited research has been conducted relating to the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> during health and physical education teacher education. The aim of this study was to investigate preservice teachers’ perceptions of the value of using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span> for health and physical education teacher education. Methods : Preservice teachers completed a qualitatively designed survey. Thematic analyses were conducted via Computer Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis Software, aligned to self-determination theory. Results : <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span> was perceived to be valuable for the following motivational components: (a) <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (choice over professional development, latest ideas, and learning flexibility), (b) relatedness (enhancing communication, tailored collaborations, and receiving practical support), and (c) competence (transferring ideas to classes, increasing technological competence, and keeping ahead of other teachers). Yet there were concerns due to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span>’s public exposure to undesired <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span> users (relatedness) and how to navigate the platform (competence). Discussion/Conclusions : The study provides guidance to health and physical education teacher education providers on how digital learning via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span> can meet preservice teachers’ learning needs.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and communication technolog</span>ies are a step forward in education, as they have given rise to innovative methodologies, such as blended learning. This type of training can be applied at any stage or educational typology such as basic vocational training. The main objective of this article is to know the degree of effectiveness of this methodology in this stage, specifically in an applied science module. For this purpose, a quasi-experimental design has been applied with a control group and an experimental group with a total of 147 participants. The results show how those students who have worked through b-learning have experienced better results in all the dimensions of the study. In conclusion, the implementation of this methodology in basic vocational training brings benefits, such as motivation and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the teaching–learning processes of all students.</p>

<p>This study sought to investigate the impact of using Cambly, a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">computer-mediated</span> communication tool, on the speaking proficiency of English as a foreign language (EFL) learners. Further, it aimed to explore the participants&amp;rsquo; perceptions of using Cambly. The study employed an experimental design featuring a mixed-methods approach to data collection that involved pre- and post-testing of the participants&amp;rsquo; speaking proficiency as well as semi-structured face-to-face interviews. The study sample consisted of 28 EFL university students who were divided into the control and experimental groups. The participants in the experimental group used Cambly to conduct audio calls with native speakers of English over a period of 4 weeks. The quantitative analysis of the participants&amp;rsquo; speaking proficiency tests revealed no significant differences between the experimental and control groups&amp;rsquo; post-test scores. Moreover, no significant differences were found between the experimental group&amp;rsquo;s pre- and post-test scores. The qualitative analysis of the participants&amp;rsquo; interviews revealed that the use of Cambly had a positive influence on their speaking proficiency, motivation, anxiety level, speaking opportunities, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, social relationships, and cultural awareness.</p>

<p>In the context of the reformation of the higher education in Ukraine the preparation of translators and interpreters requires new approaches to the process of teaching and learning. It presupposes the implementation of ways and forms aimed at active rather than passive learning, an increased sense of academic <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, development of motivation, responsibility and accountability in acquiring profession-specific knowledge, skills, communicative abilities and attitudes as well as interdependence and mutual respect between the academic teacher and the student.
 The authors of the article argue that the language tuition to students majoring in translation studies contributing to the overall development of their professional competence of intercultural mediators can be carried out in the form of extra-curricular activities via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y tools.
 With respect to the results of the grounded study of current tendencies, achievements and problems, valuable experience and outcomes related to the issue under consideration, the paper reflects on two extra-curricular activities, their stages, aims, objectives and tasks performed; analyses their importance and efficiency in promoting students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and responsibility; outlines the role and the functions of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y tools used.
 The English Speaking Club involves specially arranged meetings intended to provide practising English autonomously outside the classroom context. Participating in conversations with a native speaker students have the opportunity to improve their vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation skills, enrich their background knowledge of traditions and culture of the English-speaking countries as well as overcome psychological barriers while expressing personal views and ideas.
 Translation and Voice Over Recording Studio is organised as a project activity tailored to initiate student translators and interpreters to the real workflow of a project team specialising in translation of different types of audio and video texts in the English language into Ukrainian and their further voice over recording. Performing roles of translators, proofreaders, editors, voice-over artists and sound directors, the participants have the opportunity to practically implement knowledge, skills and communicative abilities obtained while learning profession-specific subjects at the university, developing and improving translation and interpretation skills in particular. Specially selected <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y tools provide the efficient organisation of the Club’s and Studio’s work.</p>

<p>The redefinition of the objectives of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) generates novelty in the teaching design developed by universities. The constructivist perspective encourages the use of methods that promote teamwork, an interest for information searching, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and an increased motivation for learning, among others. Currently, the acquisition of the established curricular content receives feedback thanks to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICTs). This research describes the implementation of an experience related to the use of teaching/learning participatory methods with first- and second-year students in Early Childhood Education and Primary Education bachelor’s degrees. This experience is based on flipped classrooms and role-playing and is supported by ICTs. A questionnaire was delivered to a total of 100 individuals on their perception of participatory methods and their assessment of the methods used for the described experience. After performing the analysis, the conclusions showed that higher education students considered that classroom implementation of emerging methods helped them at a theoretical, practical and professional level as well as motivated them, which allows us to advance towards the goals of the EHEA.</p>

<p>SummaryThe <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the students refers to the control that the student has in the learning process, to decide on the content, the goals and the way of learning and is connected with the concepts of self-direction and self-regulation. The concept of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> presupposes the development of a psychological relationship with the process and the content of the learning act, while the autonomous student is able to make decisions, to distance himself but also to reflect critically. <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> is related to the notion of personal responsibility that the learner assumes in his learning process, while two dimensions are distinguished. The first is autonomous learning, in which the learner assumes responsibility for the design, organization and evaluation of the educational process, which concerns its external characteristics. The second is the autonomous student, which refers to the internal characteristics of the learner. However, an important factor for the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the students is considered to be the context in which the educational process takes place, ie when the general socio-political and learning context encourages the learners to take responsibility for their learning, then their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is promoted.In the context of distance education, students are at a distance from their teachers, their classmates and the institution that provides education, but they are called to meet the requirements of the study program they choose. And while the concept of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is intertwined with the method of distance education, the factors that hinder its realization have not been sufficiently explored. This empirical research, therefore, comes to fill the gap in the literature on the obstacles that students themselves face in the realization of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.This paper explores the barriers faced by distance education students in achieving their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. In particular, it focuses on exploring the obstacles that students face with regard to <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in distance education and the factors that contribute to removing the obstacles to student <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in distance education. The quantitative approach was chosen and the tool of our research was the online questionnaire, which was completed by 215 research participants, postgraduate and undergraduate students of the Hellenic Open University. The selection of the sample was random sampling as the questionnaire was published on a social networking page (<span style="background-color:lightgreen">facebook</span>) in specific groups formed by the Hellenic Open University students and the participants chose to answer and complete the questionnaire. The empirical research took place in March - April 2019.The questionnaire included two axes. The first axis concerned demographic data. The second axis included twenty-one (21) questions that answered the research questions. Seventeen (17) of the questions were closed-ended, graded Likert scale, one (1) question with answer options, while three (3) questions were open-ended. Open-ended questions were included in order for participants to express their views on the obstacles they face, and to enrich the data from the closed-ended questions.For the analysis of the data collected from the closed-ended questions of the questionnaire, the statistical program SPSS and the descriptive statistics were used. Regarding the data of the open-ended questions, after their inclusion in broader categories, the next step was to codify the conversion of the data from nominal to numerical. In order to identify any differences in the answers of the participants, depending on the gender and the level of studies, correlations were used.The theoretical framework of the present study is closely related to the empirical research carried out. Obstacles to the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of distance learning students identified in the theoretical part are confirmed by the empirical research, with the difference that the empirical research has shown that students’ personal characteristics as well as the “distance” factor do not constitute a significant obstacle to the realization of their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.However, the empirical research also revealed several factors that were not identified in the bibliographic review as barriers to student <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, such as inadequate administrative organization, financial factors, the small number of group meetings, the lack of different types of papers, exams based on memorization and exams with books closed. It is also worth noting that while the majority of students consider that they have developed skills in order to be autonomous, they agree that a preparatory course that would prepare them for the requirements of distance education would be very helpful. The analysis and discussion of the results highlighted the prominent role of the teacher in distance education, as the lack of support for students can impede their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, however, the teacher has the potential to contribute to its realization by guiding and encouraging students. The multidimensional role of the teacher in distance education also emerges from our research, as described in the theoretical part of our work, since the participants expressed the need for teachers combining a number of characteristics in order to promote their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.Another important finding of the research is that students feel their personal characteristics and personal abilities can help them realize their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. In line with the bibliographic review, the factors that are an obstacle to the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the students of distance education, as well as the factors contributing to the removal of these obstacles, are related both to the students themselves and to the educational process.As for the factors that contribute to the removal of barriers to the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of distance learning students, they coincide with the factors that have a positive effect on the realization of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and have been identified in the theoretical framework of our work. The most important factor is the personal characteristics of the students themselves and their own personal effort. Following, the support, guidance from the teacher on a psychological and practical level and communication with him. Also very important factors are the existence of appropriate educational material and the conduct of group meetings, which students ask to be more frequent.The need for a digital learning framework to promote student <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, as found in the theoretical framework, is confirmed by the empirical research, as well as the need for electronic group meetings and the use of electronic libraries, access to specialized digital material, and easier access to the Hellenic Open University platforms.A very important factor in removing the barriers to student <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> as it emerged from the empirical research is more flexible schedules concerning the delivery of papers, while access to educational material and a better administrative organization are also considered important.Regarding the correlation of the curriculum with the factors that constitute an obstacle to <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, the majority of postgraduate and undergraduate students agree with some differentiation regarding the factors “comments of the teacher on written work”, “educational material”, “psychological support from the teacher”and“ lack of psychological support from the teacher” while gender did not appear to have any particular effect on the factors that impede students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span></p>

<i> Rosemary Wahu Mbogo </i></p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;Covid-19, a disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and in Kenya in March 2020. In Kenya, the Covid-19 pandemic has brought to light some unknown talents among the stakeholders at different levels. The economic sector has had manufacturing potential for goods, and from mass media reports, this has been demonstrated through production of Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs), ventilators and innovations in technology in the creation of apps such as the Linda App for contact tracing and Gumzo, a video conferencing app. Similarly, the education sector has also demonstrated potential for adaptation in some situations. For example, after all institutions of learning were closed to prevent the spread of coronavirus in March 2020, many universities have continued learning through Online, Distance and E-learning (ODEL) platforms, and some have even conducted virtual graduations. Others like Kenyatta University have reported innovations such as development of ventilators and modified testing swabs for Covid-19. This is admirable despite numerous limitations of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> accessibilities and other shortcomings. This remarkable achievement has been possible due to semi-<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the university education sector, where Senates are given the right and power, by the Education Act, to make autonomous decisions for their universities which are regulated and monitored using the standards and regulations set by the Commission of University Education (CUE). However, other levels of the education sector do not have this <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and have had to depend on the ministry of education for guidance. On 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; July 2020, the ministry of education announced the result of a consultative meeting with stakeholders, to postpone the reopening of schools to January 2021. This was due to the rising cases of corona virus infections in May and June, steeping the infection curve, expected to reach the peak by November and to have flattened by January 2021 (Magoha, 2020). However, what surprised many was the additional and unforeseen announcement that all basic education students (apart from standard 8 and form 4 examination candidates whose details were not clarified) will repeat their current class levels in 2021. The pronouncement caused anxiety and has attracted mixed reactions from various stakeholders. The purpose of this paper is therefore to explain the leadership decisions made by the ministry of education analyze their impact on basic education and propose possible ways for educational leaders and administrators, community leaders and volunteers to facilitate home-based education during the Covid-19 pandemic. This should be done with a goal for progression and promotion of students to the next class level when the 2020 syllabus is eventually covered. The study method utilized desktop literature research where interactions with educational leaders, scholars and practitioners were used to investigate threats and opportunities in managing education during crises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Article visualizations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=“/-counters-/edu_01/0641/a.php” alt=“Hit counter” /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>Introduction: This article mainly through the literature research method and content analysis method, has carried on the analysis to the university turnover classroom. This paper analyses the characteristics and development trend of flipped classroom research from the aspects of research fields, research topics, research methods, literature sources, author information and references. Method: This teaching method undoubtedly fully demonstrates the concept of quality education, that is, while respecting students ‘individual differences in learning, it also cultivates students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, allowing them to learn independently and develop their ability to analyze and solve problems. The flipped classroom uses the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> as a platform to adjust the teaching steps, which has changed the organization of teaching and learning, class and off-class, teaching and self-study. Result: Teachers can supplement other resources on the Flipping classroom. At the same time, according to the content of the textbook, the teacher should design the test questions. In addition, teachers should also participate in the discussion of students before class, answering questions for students online. Throughout the online learning process, teachers can obtain students’ mastery of the unit’s knowledge points through the support of big data, such as which knowledge points are difficult, which ones are mastered, and which students are well mastered, so that the teaching can be effectively adjusted. plan. The main content of the teacher in the pre-course period is to check the content of the student’s reply in the classroom exchange area to understand the students’ knowledge of the knowledge points. Conclusion: It can be seen from the above column chart that the following conclusions can be drawn through the investigation and study of the factors affecting the College psychology teaching in colleges and universities. University leaders have a certain degree of emphasis on College psychology courses, but teaching management needs to be Further improvement; the number of people in some psychology majors is too high. Some colleges and universities in the teaching objectives of psychology special courses lack the target requirements of students’ social adaptation and scientific research; most of the teachers’ theoretical teaching content is not comprehensive enough and the content is single. Discussion: This article is based on an in-depth analysis of the advantages of domestic SPOC platforms and flipped classrooms, and analyzes the course goals of psychological teaching in colleges and universities. A teaching model of psychological courses based on the SPOC platform was constructed. This article is based on the teaching of psychology, and discusses the problems related to the flip reading teaching of psychology. The purpose is to sort out the theoretical and practical problems of flipped reading teaching in psychology lessons, and better adapt to the teaching of psychology lessons in the new era and new technology.</p>

<p>The Corona Virus outbreak has impacted various sectors of various countries all over the globe and the education sector is one of those sectors that are impacted by COVID-19 even worse as compared to the other sectors. To ensure the continuity of learning and education, various educational institutes used the concept of online learning using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y. The effectiveness of education through online learning has been a great challenge for the students as well as for the teachers. In this regard, the current study has been designed with the motive to find out the impact of teacher’s perceived technological knowledge, teachers e-<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and ICT pedagogical practices on the technology integration in knowledge delivery along with the mediating role of perceived effect of teaching with technology on students in the educational institutions of Pakistan. The data was collected from 447 teachers teaching online through ICT and the results were obtained through the analysis of the collected data. The results have suggested that all the independent variables i.e.&nbsp;teacher’s perceived technological knowledge, teachers’ e-<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and ICT pedagogical practices are having a significant impact on the technology integration in knowledge delivery. On the other hand, in case of mediating role of perceived effect of teaching with technology is considered, it is found significant in case of only teacher’s perceived technological knowledge and teacher’s e-<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> but in case of the relation between ICT pedagogical practices, the mediating role of PETT is not significant.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has brought a significant impact on the in-person learning access to the on-campus Self-Access Center (SAC). Therefore, there is a need for an electronic Self-Access Language Learning (e-SALL) innovation to address the newly emerging issues in the field. This perspectives article suggests several ways of facilitating self-access learning using web-based technologies. It also includes some key technological and pedagogical considerations in providing in-person learning access beyond the school. We argue that the integration between a Learning Management System (LMS) as a web-based learning platform and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>-based materials and resources will sustain the in-person learning practice from a lens of technology and the pedagogy of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.</p>

<p>Background: E-learning is essential in health science education, and the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated its utility. Objectives: The study aimed to observe the changes in the scenario of e-learning in Indian Medical Education during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted on 905 undergraduate health science students who agreed with an online survey. A questionnaire was prepared, including sociodemographic details, utilization of commercially available e-learning programs before the pandemic, and the scenario of teaching-learning activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was validated and circulated among medical students of various states across India through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. Qualitative data were presented as numbers and percentages and quantitative data as mean (SD). Results: Of the 905 students surveyed, 69.17% (n = 626) were female students and 30.83% (n = 279) were male students. Besides, 85% (n = 395) of the students found commercial programs useful in clarifying concepts. Institutional e-learning was mandatory for 71.16% (n = 644) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the 644 students for whom e-learning was mandatory, 69.10% (n = 445) found tools like videoconferencing, Google classroom, zoom meetings, etc. useful in flexibility and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. However, 50.47% (n = 325) of the students preferred a combined method of classroom teaching and e-learning, whereas only 9.93% (n = 64) of students preferred only e-learning as a method of teaching. They were satisfied with institutional programs for clarifying concepts (n = 386; 60%) and communication skills (n = 320; 50%). Conclusions: The utility of e-learning has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, students preferred e-learning in combination with traditional teaching, especially in health science courses.</p>

<p>Blended learning based on MOOCs (b-MOOC) has become a new and wide-spread approach to combining <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> technologies with face-to-face instruction in higher education. In the implementation of b-MOOCs, learning support or scaffolding proves to be essential and determines to some extent the success of blended learning, while available literature shows lack of re-search on it. Aiming at exploring a feasible learning support approach for b-MOOCs in practice, this study constructed a support framework with four key elements of resources (R), interaction (I), strategy (S) and evaluation (E) support, briefed as RISE, and implemented it in the Business English course in a Chinese university. A survey and semi-structured interview were conducted to make clear its effects, the perceptions and expectations of students. It shows that the RISE support initiative got wide recognition and resulted in various improvements, promoting learning <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, improving learning strategy, increasing interaction and time devoted. As to suggestions, more targeted and higher degree of support is expected by learners and they show preference for face-to-face instruction and suggestion is raised that the proportion of face-to-face section should be no less than the online part. The results of this study may offer practical reference in b-MOOC design about how to support learning process of students and what components and methods are effective.</p>

<p>Global informatization is one of the dominant trends in contemporary social reality. Digital <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies have enormous innovation potential for the overall modernization and transformation of education and the enrichment of pedagogical sciences. Realizing this potential requires technologies to be fully integrated into educational practice. A high degree of integration is a prerequisite for the implementation of constructivism, increasing <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, personal responsibility of learners and the opportunity for personalized learning.
 Digital technological integration is a progressive change of education to a degree of transformation. In the process of gradual merging of information and communication and pedagogical technologies, innovative pedagogical practices are created, and they cannot be realized without modern technological means. The characteristics of the methods of teaching and learning with digital technologies determine different degrees of integration which are entry, adoption, adaptation, infusion, and transformation.
 The current features of the applied methods for using Information Communication Technology (ICT) in the Bulgarian secondary education in technology, and entrepreneurship (grades 5-7) were studied by surveying 127 pedagogues teaching this subject. A questionnaire is attached examining the goals, frequency use of digital tools in the educational process, and the applied management decisions for choosing the digital tools and working with them. The analysis of the obtained data showed that ICT was used, but the degree of integration was low and corresponded to the initial levels of entry and initial adoption of the integration process. In isolated cases, lessons were held according to how students performed in activities specific to their level of adaptation.</p>

<p>The online teaching accelerated at an unprecedented pace in the wake of the physical closure of educational institutions in the United Kingdom on 23 March 2020 due to the COVID-19 crisis. This study is based on a survey of mature undergraduate students in private higher education institutes in the South of England and their experience with online teaching during the COVID-19. The questionnaire was sent out to mature undergraduate students studying in three private higher education institutes, and we received 225 responses. A quantitative approach was used to analyse the results. Majority of students 95% were using online teaching for the first time, and they were novice with the online teaching software (Zoom and Microsoft Teams, etc.). They were provided with training for online teaching, especially how to use the software, and they were satisfied with the training. The study also identified challenges students faced during the online teaching such as weak <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> connection, old devices (computer and laptop etc.) low level of digital competency especially among older students, lack of technical support from the institute and stressful transition period. The final findings from the study indicated that the quick decision of switching to online teaching was right, and the majority of students found online teaching excited. Consequently, the majority of students wanted to continue online teaching after the COVID-19 because it provides ease and convenience, no travelling time &amp; cost, freedom and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The online teaching training for students could be made more effective, and private higher education institutions could also address challenges such as weak <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> connection and old devices (computer, laptop, etc.).

<p>In this article, topics related to the urgent transition to distance education (DE), through decisive measures taken to protect Russian university community against consequences of COVID-19 epidemic are covered. Based on semi-structured interviews with administrators, faculty, IT specialists and students, it is argued that in the force majeure circumstances the university offers for DE a standard model of one-size-fits-all curriculum though modified through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies. The use of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> in a localized online space is limited to delivering courses without considering needs of individual learners, their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, preferences and prior knowledge of the subject. The observation method was used by both participant and non-participant. An experiment on the teachers’ self-assessment proves that many still view the university as a source of offline information for students. The article purports to discuss ways to promote DE by the concepts of postindustrial educational space connectivism, hyperconnectivity of social networks, teachers’ reflective practice, digital nativity of teachers and students in mastering <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies. It is claimed that real transition of a Russian university to DE cannot be achieved without <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>-provided increased transactional distance in the dialogue between the teacher and students mediated by technology and reflective approach.</p>

<p>This paper investigated tertiary EFL students’ overall perception of the use of fully online learning during the Covid-19 pandemic. By administering a survey to 125 students of the English Language Education Program in a State Islamic University in West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia, using 26 items of a questionnaire with a five-point Likert scale, this study unravelled students’ responses in terms of three constructs including Perceived Usefulness (PU), Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) and Perceived Instructor Characteristics (PIC). The findings suggested that in terms of PU, even though the data mostly demonstrated neutral responses for most of the questionnaire items, the students tended to perceive online learning as to provide flexible time for their learning and foster their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>/independence and confidence. However, the students tended to perceive online learning as less facilitating for their understanding of subjects. In terms of PEOU, the responses reflected the students’ readiness to employ online learning as the data suggested that they possessed both the technology and the knowledge to use it. However, they tended to encounter problems when operating the technology, especially concerning the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> connection. On the other hand, these students perceived instructor characteristics as mostly positive. Therefore, online learning seemed to have not been designed to engage all students, yet seemed to be an inevitable option during the outbreak as the report from the interviews demonstrated that F2F classes were still preferred over online learning. Finally, these findings imply the need for redesigning online learning to better engage students in virtual classes.</p>

<p>This paper deals with the role of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>y (ICT) in higher education institutions in terms of capability enhancement of learners. In addition, the intents of this research paper is to focus towards online and distance education related with higher education institutions of Nepal. Particularly, the relation of ICT with capability enhancement, the relation of ICT and ODL mode of higher education learners, and the relation of ICT and capability with student learning has been explored in this paper. Theoretically, capability enhancement has been discussed in terms of connectivism and learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Moreover, the theories of capability enhancement as interpreted by Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum have also been used to discuss this issue. Besides contributing to quality human life, ICT is found to be helpful in promoting good behavior and attitudes, increasing their ability toward being, doing, and functioning. Integrating technology in education can help change people’s lives.

<p>Virtual spaces to help learn a language or write autonomously have become common and are only likely to increase. Multiple resources can be placed on a site easily accessible 24/7 and computer mediated communication in various forms can supply needed human interaction spaces. But how are these sites used by the local students? Following the path of several individuals in detail can allow more understanding and depth of the precise usage of space. This paper tracks two Arab students exploring and using a newly formed online self-access centre (SAC) for writing or online writing lab (OWL) for the best part of a semester. As an exploratory action research study, it was data driven and multiple data sources were mainly unobtrusive so that the study could proceed very naturally. The choices, learning style, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> types and personality differences between the two students suggest a range of support is ideal in an online SAC to cater for individuals in this context, including resources, how to learn, 1-1 asynchronous with advisor (<span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s), forums, electronic writing raters, and a high profile test. Ongoing action research should help to keep the online facility relevant to needs and open to new ways.</p>

<p>In U.S. v.American Library Association (2003), the Supreme Court upheld the Child <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> Protection Act (CIPA), which mandated that libraries receiving federal funding for public <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> access install content-filtering programs on computers which provide that access. These programs analyze incoming content, and block the receipt of objectionable material, in particular pornography. Thus, patrons at public libraries are protected from unintentionally (or intentionally) accessing objectionable material, and, in the case of minors, from accessing potentially damaging material. At least, that is the official story. In this paper, I develop three points. (1) I argue that CIPA and ALA are better read as examples of the enforcement of a regime of normative sexuality. The question of minors accessing pornography is only relevant to the official story insofar as it provides a rhetorically persuasive example of deviance from that normative regime. CIPAs full target includes information about topics such as homosexuality and contraception. (2) Rather than (or in addition to) punishing deviances directly, CIPA attempts to constitute a “public” in which such deviancy can never occur in the first place. Hence, the designation of a “public” space serves to domesticate alternative sexualities and to sanitize that space of sexual difference. (3) This interaction at the border of the public and private spheres offers an opportunity to reflect on and underscore the ways that subject formation and subjectivity are mediated through technological artifacts like the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>.</p>

<p>Technical reproduction in general, and photography in particular have changed the status and practices of art. Similarly, the expansion of Web 2.0 interactive spaces presents opportunities and challenges to artistic communities. Present study focuses on artistic activism: socially sensitive artists publish their creation on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> on its most interactive space – <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. These artworks carry both artistic and social messages. Such practices force us to reinterpret some elements of the classical art paradigm: its <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, authorship, uniqueness (as opposed to copies and series), and the social role of art. The analysis is aimed at Hungarian and Romanian online artistic projects from Transylvania region of Romania, relevant as intercultural communication endeavours. Our research question is the way they differ from the traditional artistic paradigm.</p>

<p>Traditional classrooms confine English as a Foreign Language (EFL) reading to the textbook and the classroom setting, something that demotivates active reading. With the advent of mobile technology, however, such boundaries can be broken to include external reading materials where students could read and share anytime and anywhere. This paper investigates the role of mobile technology in enhancing Learner <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> (LA) in the EFL reading context among students in the Preparatory Year (PY) of Najran University in Saudi Arabia. A reading class of 30 students utilised mobile applications (WhatsApp and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> search engines such as Google) to access external reading materials and interact with their peers and teachers outside the classroom. Qualitative data collection underwent a number of procedures. The baseline data was constructed from the students’ portfolios, which reported the participants’ traditional reading practices and use of mobiles. Then, the participants were encouraged to use <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> search engines and WhatsApp group to share their readings. Finally, five participants were interviewed. The data analysis revealed that the participants’ LA is improved through the use of selected mobile applications in terms of taking responsibility for and making decisions about reading materials and the time and place of reading. The study recommends further investigation into the role of mobile applications for generating learners’ own tasks and writing skills.</p>

<p>The world is constantly undergoing changes, and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> is being used as an important teaching resource. From the chalk piece to the computer, technology has been present in school as a link between action and learning for professors and students. Technological tools are more and more frequent in the class room: the computer along with its chief resource – the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> – have raised a debate about their effectiveness in school education. The use of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> in educational programs has revealed that this resource gives rise to educational environments which are different from that of the traditional attendance classes regarding the roles of teachers and students, the flow of information, the degree of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and participation of students, and the development of complex competencies such as those involving the resolution of problems. Nevertheless, experience shows that these results are useful and effective only when teachers are technically prepared for them. To educate using new technology is a challenge which has not yet been thoroughly tackled. Technology may help, but to educate is fundamentally to learn how to manage a set of information and turn it into something significant to the individual, namely knowledge. The introduction of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> into school programs acts as a catalyst for change. Therefore it is appropriate to consider this new tool as a precious aid to learning.</p>

<p>This paper introduces a virtual reality (VR) system which was designed to promote English speaking proficiency as learners carry out collaborative information gap tasks. In a former study, a simpler system was developed to explore the effect of modality on learners’ foreign language anxiety (FLA) where results suggested that anxiety was statistically significantly lower in the VR environment compared to a voice and video <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> system. However, of three key affordances—presence, interactivity, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>—the previous system only focused on presence. The current system features an interactive component also. In this paper, we present results of a study which compared the two systems (presence-only versus interactive system) with the aim of answering the question: Does more-fully utilizing the affordances of VR lower or increase learners’ FLA? In a counterbalanced design, 30 participants (15 pairs) completed a spot-the-difference task in two different VR environments: static-VR (former system) and interactive-VR (current system). Results of a post-experimental questionnaire suggested that there was no difference in participants’ FLA for the two domains. However, a significant difference was found in terms of ease of communication and enjoyment which favored the interactive-VR mode. Additionally, compared to predictions that the interactive-VR task would be more cognitively demanding, it was considered simpler than the static-VR task. This suggests that using more of the affordances of VR by increasing interactivity further may make the embodied experience more life-like and therefore increase opportunities for learning. This paper introduces the system, implications for researchers and teachers, and future research directions.</p>

<p>The corporations perceive human capital as the greatest potential for competitive advantage, and staff training as a prerequisite for achieving the company’s strategic aim since business success and market competitiveness directly depend on the ability of employees to provide life long learning. In the context of searching the ways of optimizing this process, the aim of our study is to determine the features and opportunities for the development of individualization of learning by means of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies in multinational corporations in Canada in order to use their experience in Ukrainian higher education. The set of interrelated general scientific research methods was used to achieve this goal: analysis, synthesis, comparison, generalization, systematization, which were used to study the scientific literature, programs and corporate training courses in multinational corporations in Canada. Analysis of training in Canadian multinational corporations shows that the use of the advanced <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies in independent non-formal learning, including mobile learning, social networks, Massive Open Online Courses, electronic coaching, corporate blogs, gamification, wikis, etc., contributes to the deepening of individualization of training, and the practice of employee’s independent planning and implementation of his/her learning process is becoming more common. The study concludes that individualization is an important aspect of training in Canadian multinational corporations. The basis of individualization of learning is self-direction, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of students, their willingness to take responsibility for planning and implementation of all stages of their learning.</p>

<p>Under the trend of “<span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>+Education”, the online and offline blended teaching mode has become an important direction of teaching reform. This article takes the course “Cooking Technology” as an example to build an online and offline blended teaching mode, and investigates the application of blended teaching in the teaching of applied undergraduate courses. Using empirical analysis and interview methods, the article found that the curriculum teaching of “Cooking Technology” has insufficient combination of theory and practice, single teaching mode, poor teaching effect, and heavy teaching tasks. Base on the principle of student-centered, pedagogical coherence, integration of theory and practice, this article designs the blended teaching activities for the “Cooking Technology” course from the three major links, which is the pre-course phase, in-class stage and after-school phase. This article puts forward the issues that should be focus on interaction in blended learning and teaching, establishing a reasonable and sound appraisal method, pay attention to the percentage of online instruction used, so as to provide reference and reference for the construction of “golden courses” of culinary majors and other majors. Finally, the study found that the blended teaching can better cultivate students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in learning and solve the basic problems that most students are not interested in learning.</p>

<p>In foreign language instruction, students are often exposed to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">computer-mediated</span> testing in international exams and language courses; however, regular classrooms are not equipped with computer labs to offer a lesson coherent with that testing procedure. To fill this gap, mobile-assisted language learning emerges as a portable option for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">computer-mediated</span> learning and testing. Hence, this action research aims to study the implementation of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s-assisted practice, combined with note-taking, as test-wise and test-management strategies, to tackle the needs of 218 participants who were taking an English as a foreign language program at a Colombian university. In the diagnostic stage, learners expressed that the most difficult computer-assessed skill was speaking, due to lack of confidence and suitable strategies. Findings revealed an improvement in students’ oral performance, collaboration levels, and high acceptance of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s-assisted practice as a test preparation tool that facilitates <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, metacognition, and peer-feedback.</p>

<p>While in the 90s the New London Group advocated a definition of literacy that takes into account modes of expression other than written, today the comparison of different cultures (Cole, 1996) makes it more essential than ever to reflect on what kind of literacy enables integration into contemporary Western societies.We propose some ideas developed within the Italian L2 classes for refugees and asylum seekers from the DiCO education project, which is committed to promoting the research and the implementation of discoveries in contemporary glottodidactics research studies through training, workshops and innovative teaching and learning materials.The paper aims at both investigating the notion of literacy itself and illustrating some insights on possible digital literacy (Buckingham 2015) paths parallel to traditional literacy acquisition ones, with particular focus on the so-called media-literacy (ibid.) as a means to support learning and teaching.Some hands-on examples will be provided throughout the paper, presenting <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> built- in features that, by changing the shape of the educational content (Pireddu, Maragliano 2012), facilitate language acquisition of adult learners with low education.

<p>The evolution of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies has changed the way we relate to each other and how we build our knowledge. This creates challenges for education systems, as school must provide all students with the educational experiences that will enable them to develop the skills reflected in the profile of the 21st-century student on com pletion of compulsory schooling. It is up to teachers to find new ways of teaching, making the most of the resources and digital tools made available by mobile technologies. Technology can make a significant contribution to increasing students’ motivation because it is closer to what they like and use in their daily lives. And this introduction of technology into the classroom can promote student-oriented teaching, which contributes to the development of skills such as <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, critical thinking and self-esteem.
 One of the areas that can contribute to this paradigm shift is the creation of experiences in immersive learning environments such as Transmedia Storytelling. Immersive learning environments can favour the creation and implementation of projects that promote reading skills in schools. This is the focus of this article.
 The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of transmedia storytelling on the level of motivation of students and on the improvement of pedagogical practices implemented by the teachers involved. This case study was carried out in the subject of Portuguese in three 7th-grade classes of a school from the Médio Tejo region.
 The results obtained suggest a high level of motivation of students and teachers. The latter recognise that pedagogical routes using Transmedia Storytelling contribute to the motivation, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and improvement of students’ learning.</p>

<p>The article investigates the problem of developing motivation for learning of higher education students in the process of linguistic and professional training in the conditions of distance learning. Motivation for learning is interpreted as a system of external and internal motives for learning, the hierarchy and interaction of which is formed under the influence of pedagogical conditions, has a multilevel structure, the formation levels of which can be assessed by a certain criteria and indicators. The specific factors of motivation for learning are characterized, the reasons for the motivation decrease of students of non-language specialities when studying a foreign language are regarded. The necessity of realizing the principles of subjectivity, professionally-oriented technological effectiveness, interactivity, independence (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>), communicativeness, consciousness, accessibility, and stages in the linguistic and professional development of students in the conditions of distance learning is proved. The active introduction of distance learning technologies to the education system of Ukraine is emphasized. The distance learning is interpreted as a system of professionally oriented training of students constructed in a certain way in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> environment. The effectiveness of distance learning and the specifics of designing individual educational routes of higher education students are substantiated. The main tasks and imperatives of linguistic and professional training of future specialists are determined. The special importance of improving the goals, content, forms and methods of teaching in order to increase motivation for learning of students is emphasized.</p>

During 2008-2009, Concordia Lutheran College (CLC), an Australian K-12 school and Patrick County High School (PCHS), an American secondary school worked together to deliver the Independent Learning Centre Program (ILCP) as developed by Carmichael (2008). This project utilized the Learning Activity Management System (LAMS) as a support system for delivery. The purpose of the online delivery was to make available to Patrick County High School, the teaching and learning strategies enhancing independent learning skills for information literacy and differentiated instruction (Tomlinson, 2003) via the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. The program gave students in both schools the opportunity to collaborate internationally and engage in a research topic of personal interest.

<p>The article deals with theoretical and practical aspects of the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies of training in philosophy classes in the process of professional training of future specialists in labor protection. The author analyzed the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies during training sessions - lectures and seminars on philosophy, preparation of abstracts and scientific works on the specified discipline. It is revealed that the systematic use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies of teaching allows creating a fundamentally new information educational sphere, thus providing wide opportunities for educational activities, greatly affects the redistribution of roles among its participants, increases motivation, develops <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, provides individualization and differentiation of the educational process , contributes to the modernization of the traditional education system. All this makes it possible to improve the quality of learning. The article states that the inclusion of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies in the educational process creates a network environment in which education becomes a sequence of social contacts, each of which is communication. Thanks to the use of modern <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies, in particular in philosophy classes, the teacher has the opportunity to use all the necessary tools for effective assimilation and perception of the researched issues. Lectures become more saturated with factual material, and students listen more, rather than writing under dictation, which is positively perceived by listeners. Modern multimedia technologies, opening students access to non-traditional sources of information, increase the efficiency of independent work in philosophy, provide completely new opportunities for creativity, finding and consolidating new professional skills, allow to implement fundamentally new forms and methods of learning, which certainly has a positive effect on the common activities of teacher and student in the process of studying philosophy.</p>

<p>The development of electronic communication brings to rapid language and speech-communicative changes. These changes make the scientific task of their timely conceptualization urgent. The purpose of this study is to generalize and analyze the research results on the onyms functioning in the electronic environment and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> communication. The analysis highlights two the main areas of the research that have developed in science to date. The functioning of the proper name in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> discourse is the study object of the first group. The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> environment is mainly a source of language material according to this group research, which is analyzed considering the electronic communications features (its polycode, informality, interactivity). The feature of this group research is that its’ the main object is represented either by specific linguistic phenomena or special types of discourse, while electronic communication is a secondary feature for its highlight. The second research direction involves the study of new onomastic phenomena that owe their existence to the context of the electronic environment and its communicative, pragmatic, and technical features. This research direction implies both the detection of new types of onyms that were generated by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> communications, and the description of their characteristic semantic, pragmatic, stylistic, and formal grammatical features. A special status among the objects studied in the second direction is given to such a phenomenon as a nickname, which implements a whole set of features that allow us to talk about its principal novelty and uniqueness. A nickname is the result of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in terms of pragmatic and communication. This contributes to its use as a means of self-presentation and expression; also, a nickname has noticeable formal features that represent the ways of its construction (free choice of motivational bases, language play, active use of non-alphabetic characters). There is also noted an impact of new phenomena in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> onomastics on the onomastic system and emphasized the need for closer attention to this influence.</p>

<p>Learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is considered as one of the most important factors contributing to lifelong learning for language learners studying at university. This is primarily because learners were likely to feel motivated and engaged when they were given the freedom to take charge of their learning. Higher Education in Oman has been relatively a recent phenomenon that was introduced three decades before. Ministry of Higher Education in Oman emphasis developing lifelong learning and self-study skills in learners studying at a higher educational institution in Oman. Most of the learners studying at higher educational institutions were taught by the native Arab speakers in schools, and they were mostly dependent on their teachers for the completion of different academic tasks in schools. Learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is now not desired but the obligatory aspect of learning under the current unprecedented circumstances where learners were required to take control of their learning, complete their tasks, assignments and projects on their own and where teacher intervention is minimal due to ‘remote teaching’ situation. The prevalent situation where technology has now taken the pivotal role in shaping the 21st century teaching and learning process, it is high need for the EFL learners studying at tertiary level at the university should be autonomous and critical thinkers who can control of their learning process and aware of the necessities of learning. Therefore, considering the learners’ spoon-feeding learning attitude at school and fast-changing learning requirement, the researcher aimed at identifying learners’ understanding and perceptions to achieve <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in learning in an EFL Context. This study also aims at finding out learners’ belief on the role of peers, teachers and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> in achieving <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in learning. By using mixed method approach, the researcher designed a 35-items Likert scale questionnaire and semi-structured interview questions to record the perceptions of 135 EFL learners studying at tertiary level in a private university in Oman. The results of the current study revealed that students were aware of the concept of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and they believe that teacher’s scaffolding, peer intervention and use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms can not only help them to foster <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in them but also to gain confidence, motivation, self-esteem, sense of responsibility and self-determination in an EFL language learning environment. The implications of this research will assist the EFL teachers and the administration to consider EFL learners learning needs and learners’ self-efficacy and attitude towards their own learning.</p>

<p>This paper explores how first-year students experienced emergency online teaching during COVID-19 and aims at understanding individual experiences related to basic psychological need satisfaction, considering different levels of contextual facilitators for learning activities involving technology in higher education derived from the C-flat model. Employing a case study approach, interviews of 15 chemistry students were qualitatively analyzed. The results show negative effects of lacking <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> connectivity and concurrence of learning and home spaces but positive effects of ceased commute between home and campus. Teachers’ implementation of digital learning opportunities was perceived as adequate but did not sufficiently address the overwhelming increase in students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and decrease in social relatedness. Students’ self-regulation skills as well as skills to initiate and maintain social contacts for interactive learning activities and for motivational support emerged as crucial aspects. Many students were not able to cope appropriately and students’ need satisfaction during emergency online teaching appeared to be related to students’ prior need satisfaction resulting in five groups of students, with two being relatively resilient and three being vulnerable to the disruptions of regular onsite teaching. Implications for further research and practice are discussed. • First year students experienced overwhelming <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> during emergency online teaching. • Students struggled with maintaining social contacts for learning and motivational support. • Coping abilities are related to earlier study related psychological need satisfaction. • Lacking <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and concurrence of learning and home space are major problems. • Teaching via webinars provides structure, but interactive teaching forms are needed.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has placed schools around the world under unprecedented challenges where saving students’ lives is placed ahead of education as a priority. Within these conditions of distress and uncertainty, education authorities had no choice but to move traditional classes into online ones to ensure the sustainability of studies. The abrupt inevitable decision has been a first for most if not all teachers and students who are invited to cope with a totally new teaching/learning model without necessarily having prior experience in Distance Learning in terms of apparatus or techniques. This study comes as an in-progress appraisal of the D-learning scenarios proposed by Moulay Ismail University (MIU) in Meknes, Morocco, based on a two-level evaluation model (Reaction and Learning) proposed by Daniel Kirkpatrick. It is a real-time evaluation of a learning strategy that has long been considered optional for some students, to become, rather, a plan A constituent for many education departments around the world. The study investigates areas of success and failure from the students’ perspective via 4 sub-indicators: accessibility, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, retention and psychological impact. The study concludes that the figures can be more reassuring about the D-learning experience in MIU once issues related to connectivity and communication are redressed.

<p>The technological progress in the social field in a sudden way, specifically in the pedagogical field due to the spread of COVID-19, has had to force and use new teaching and learning strategies. As one of these many teaching processes is the method known as e-learning, which has become more valuable and very important in these times due to the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The research method applied is descriptive, correlational, cross-sectional and predictive. The sample applied in this research is 608 students of the 5th grade of secondary education in the province of Sullana, Piura region of Peru. The results reveal the existence of a very significant influence in almost all the dimensions of the study. The dimensions with the highest association values are participation-<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, outcome resolution, decision concepts and decision outcomes. The dimensions with the lowest strength of association are undoubtedly the motivation rating, which can be interpreted as meaning that motivation does not have a strong influence on the results. It can be concluded that the application of the e-learning method in the teaching of 5th grade high school students in the area of mathematics is positively valued, although a strong incidence of the method on the grades is not observed, due to the fact that a lower percentage of students were unaware of the application of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies for online learning. In addition, women tend to rate <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and participation more positively than men when the aforementioned teaching method is applied.</p>

<p>Changes in mobile technologies, developments in information technologies and telecommunication, computers programs and expansion of mobile market, likewise have inspired people to make use of these “anytime” and “anywhere” technologies in second language teaching. Use of mobile devices in language teaching has been the focus of language learning studies since language learning necessitates interaction and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> which are the key concepts in mobile assisted language learning for learners.
 The research aims at investigating Iraqi EFL secondary school students’ perceptions towards using mobile language learning technique.
 To achieve the aim of the present research, a sample of 40 secondary school students were chosen randomly from many schools .
 To fulfill the aim of the study, the questionnaire of students consists of (17) items. After the analysis of the data, the findings indicated that the vast majority of students had had used their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s to study English. Also, they expressed their welcome towards using this technology to study English in the future.
 It is recommended to promote the use of mobile learning devices, and encourage students to use mobile as a means of learning and teaching English language in various stages of education.</p>

<p>Technology has posed many challenges to the teaching methods and materials of English as a second language. English teachers have to switch over to hi tech-based productive teaching methods from the conventional chalk and board method which no longer appeals to students of an entirely new generation of English learners with changing needs. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>, the most widely used type of social networking service, can be explored as an alternative learner- friendly mode of learning English.

<p>The need to move away from autonomous academic endeavors toward a more inclusive process involving all stakeholders in higher education provides the backdrop for this article. The introduction of the Paradigm of <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> and arguments for moving away from this view to one of collaboration and inclusion is framed within the context of educational outcomes and assessment. Research has shown that limited work has been done across institutions in developing “shared” outcomes and assessment across curriculum and “values.” The Electronic Portfolio (utilization of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> as a platform for wide distribution and discussion of materials) is introduced as a mechanism to harness information technology for achieving the objectives of developing discourse on achieving acceptance of wide-ranging outcomes and assessment measures. The involvement of all stakeholders in the process, particularly those beyond the academy, is seen as an integral part of building an emerging paradigm of collaboration and inclusion in the development of shared outcomes and assessment metrics. The use of the Electronic Portfolio as the information technology vehicle is described in some detail.</p>

<p>The article reveals the evaluation of the activities carried out by scientific and pedagogical staff in domestic higher education institutions from a process point of view and the standpoint of the result. The main types of assessment used in higher education institutions are described. The results obtained during the analysis of scientific publications, normative documents and questionnaires of teachers and managers confirmed the massive rating of the activities of scientific and pedagogical workers, its superiority among other types of assessment.
 According to the materials available in the open <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> access, a comparative analysis of the rating policy of 20 higher education institutions, located in different regions of Ukraine, was carried out. It was found that in each university the determinant of the rating policy is Development Strategy, according to which the evaluation of research and teaching staff is positioned as an important procedure for internal quality assurance of higher education and a factor in stimulating professional development of teachers.
 Based on a comparative analysis of the regulatory framework, criteria, indicators and evaluation procedures inherent in different institutions of higher education, common features and characteristics of rating evaluation of research and teaching staff. The personal and institutional dimensions of the significance of various evaluation of the activity of scientific and pedagogical workers are revealed. Emphasis is placed on modern indicators and problematic evaluation issues identified in the process of studying domestic practices. Insufficient use of information collected through rating assessment for prognostic purposes is emphasized.
 The tendency of updating criteria and indicators of a rating estimation of activities carried out by scientific and pedagogical workers of universities is established. An objective relationship between the establishment of coefficients for the rating of the main types of professional activities of research and teaching staff (educational, scientific, methodological, organizational and educational) and the priority of the holding activities for the university at the time of the rating.</p>

Its strength is in helping students compose pragmatically appropriate texts which could substantially increase their confidence and the feeling of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. It accomplishes this by providing writers with tone indications of their text paired with emojis to help navigate the sometimes opaque waters of pragmatics. However, this tool does not provide indications of which words or phrases contribute to an indicated tone, nor does it offer suggestions for improvement. It is a perpetual beta tool in that it asks for user input to continually adapt and learn to the changing communicative situation.

<p>The Fundamental Reform Document of Education, IRI was approved by the Supreme Council of Cultural Revolution in 2011. Based on different reports and studies, however, it seems that a decade after approval, not only the majority of its operational strategies have not been implemented, but its setting and establishment is still in a state of ambiguity. As school’s educational staff are the most crucial element of implementing such a document, this survey measures school readiness and staff familiarity. In this case, the survey method was used comprises the number of 129 educational staff working in public and private schools at different levels elementary, middle, and high schools including girls and boys) was studied in Tehran and Kerman provinces. Results showed that educational staff is familiar with the Fundamental Reform Document of Education, its theoretical foundation, and subsequently with its six subsystems, respectively. The readiness of schools to implement the Fundamental Reform Document of Education is also as follows: 81% for the relationship between schools and institutions, 77% for educational staffs readiness, 76% fostering affairs, 73% for the preparedness of classrooms, workshops, and laboratories, 72% for teachers with professional experiences, 71% for access to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> infrastructure, 66% for sports space, facilities, and equipment, 65% for schools’ institutional <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for decision-making, and 56% for financial resources.

<p>The objectives of this study were to compare the impact of peer feedback implementation with teacher involvement through training in the classroom and asynchronous <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communication</span> on the quality of students’ writing revisions, as well as to investigate students’ perceptions of peer feedback activities. Twenty-five students participated in the experimental study. Eleven students were willingly to be interviewed. Inferential statistical analysis was used to interpret the quantitative data collected from students’ essay writing scores. Meanwhile, the data obtained through observations and interviews was interpreted using qualitative coding analysis. The results of the inferential statistical analysis revealed that peer feedback activities conducted through asynchronous online interactions had more significant effects compared to those conducted face to face on students’ writing revision. Further, after conducting a thematic analysis, six themes emerged: 1) peer feedback activities could increase students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in learning, 2) the teacher’s involvement in peer feedback activities was beneficial in terms of improving the consistency of feedback and revision, 3) peer feedback through asynchronous online interactions gave extra time to produce more beneficial comments, 4) peer feedback activities through asynchronous online interactions gave more chances to become a writing audience, 5) communicating via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> made the students feel awkward, and 6) recorded feedback via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> comments was more beneficial for students’ revision. The implication of the research is that teachers of English needs to consider asynchronous online interactions for students’ writing revision when teaching writing.</p>

<p>This is a review of the extant literature on inhibitors to the electronic teaching and learning of Library and Information Science (LIS) in Nigerian universities. The university-wide inhibitors as identified by the study are non-provision or inadequacy of: funding, administrative and infrastructural supports, functional ICT laboratories/tools, ICT-compliant teaching staff and standby and responsive technical support for both teachers and students. Library schools’ inhibitors include poor maintenance culture, lack of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> presence, dedicated bandwidth and active websites while the teaching and learning inhibitors highlighted by the study are (older) teachers’ poor attitude, concerns on how to retain the copyright of their lecture contents, plagiarism and the quality of students’ work; fear of additional workload which may result in stress and burnt-out; lack of freedom or teaching <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (as teaching may now take the collaborations of colleagues, computer experts and instructional/graphic designers); teachers’/students’ poor expertise and technology background and nature of course, among others. The author made suggestions on the way forward for an increased and a sustainable integration of ICTs in teaching and learning, especially in this Post-COVID-19 Pandemic Era where physical contact and interactions may need to be reduced to the barest minimum to contain contagious communication and consequent health hazards. This review has implications for library educators, students and educational managers in the universities of other developing countries.</p>

<p>The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> is the greatest gift of science and technology to mankind and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> is the cheapest technological tool that has reached the common man irrespective of social and economic status. The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> with the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> is an interesting and exciting language learning tool that offers myriad opportunities for English language learners outside the formal classroom. It also promotes learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and communication skills. Though some private educational institutions do not encourage students to use it on campus, it cannot be denied that it offers a lot of learning experiences to students as well as teachers on campus and off campus. It helps students spend leisure time more usefully and constructively <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>ting with and messaging to friends. Teachers and students of English can use it inside the classroom not only as a tool, but also a source of reliable information for learning English. It has unique features that textbooks and reference books lack. This study analyzes students’ views on the use of online <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>ting/messaging for promotion of ‘speech in writing’ as the third medium of communication that demolishes the man-made artificial division between speech and writing as modes of communication. The results of the survey are highly revealing, positive, and encouraging on the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> for acquisition of communication skills in English.</p>

<p>This study describes 26 English language teaching faculty members’ and 32 preservice English as a foreign language teachers’ emergency remote teaching experiences and emotions. Verbal data gathered through an online questionnaire with open questions were analyzed using semidirected content analysis. Most faculty and all students reported negative feelings, which were connected with some faculty members’ focus on delivering content without interaction and with insufficient <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> access. Some students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> allowed them to overcome the first of these challenges. Teachers with online education training reported better experiences. Thus, universities and the State must provide more training and equipment to close the digital gap and ensure effective emergency remote teaching.</p>

<p>Emergency remote teaching was regulated by the National Council of Education through Decision nº5/2020, approved on April 28th 2020, in Brazil, as an alternative to cover for the absence of face-to-face teaching. The Ordinance states that remote teaching activities must be applied to students of all education levels, steps, and modalities. As such, the main objective of this study was to investigate, through a bibliographic research, what are the skills that teachers of high ability/gifted students should have in the context of remote classes. We undertook a qualitative bibliographic research by surveying material readily available for consulting on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>, such as educational books, periodic publications, and laws pertaining to high ability/gifted students and their learning process. After sorting through this material, we conducted an analysis to discuss data and later compiled suggestions of potential methodologies that could be applied to online classrooms. Our findings emphasize that both teaching knowledge and practice must offer high ability/gifted students optimized challenges, which integrate provocative novelties and motivate the development of their abilities and the dynamicity in activities. Furthermore, they also foster the students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, making individual interests deeper, as well as their creative, critical and research abilities. Therefore, active learning methodologies are an asset to the teaching-learning process of students with specific educational needs.</p>

The following paper reports on a study developed with sixth graders at a public institution in Tunja, Colombia. The study was implemented during the first semester of 2016, and its goal was to develop speaking skills through workshops organized on a web page. Data was collected through field notes, students’ artifacts, recordings, and questionnaires. The results showed that the use of ICTs caught the students’ attention, encouraged them to speak English, and increased their vocabulary. Being able to speak and understand more vocabulary could help students use the language in real life situations, as well as reinforce their learning <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.</p>

<p>It is widely accepted that digital technologies (popularly known as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies or ICT) have the potential to strengthen and reform school education. However, in the absence of clear framework for program design, the impact on learning processes and outcomes from numerous attempts by different governments and other actors has not lived up to this potential. This note provides a holistic framework for such a design, covering infrastructure, teacher education, curriculum and content and education administration, aiming to support the creation of an ecosystem of ICT integration. The note assumes certain principles- firstly ICT program should aim to support the achievement of educational aims. A deep understanding of aims, philosophies, contexts, needs and priorities of education in India, is indispensable for meaningful and effective program design.</p>
<p>Secondly, ICT implementation must support the achievement of education policy. The thrust of these policies has been to support constructivist classroom pedagogies, make learning connected to local contexts and responsive to learner needs, make the school culture democratic and participatory, support decentralized school system administration by strengthening school <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, teacher agency and connecting the school to the local community, going beyond a narrow focus on learning outcomes. The ‘public’ nature of education aligns strongly with free and open ICT architectures. It is recommended by the National ICT policy that the ICT implementation in school education use free and open technologies, including FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) and OER (Open Educational Resources). The design of ICT programs must consciously aim for sustainability, where the schools and other institutions can continue the integration of ICT beyond the initial investment period. Developing in-house capacities of teachers and teacher educators to appropriate free and open ICTs for their work, can sustain the use of ICT, freed from vendor lock-ins. Using ICT to build peer networks of teachers can support continuing professional development and sustain ICT implementation in the school.</p>

<p>This study was an attempt to investigate whether using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Instagram</span> had any significant effects on Iranian intermediate autonomous/dependent EFL learners’ pictorial metaphors or not. In doing so, Oxford Placement Test was administered among100 EFL learners studying at Rooyesh language institute in Kelishad, Isfahan, Iran; and based on the results, 80 EFL learners were selected. Then, the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> test was conducted to divide them into autonomous and dependent groups. In the next step, they were divided into two equal experimental and control groups (N=40) that each group was subdivided to an autonomous and a dependent group (i.e., 20 autonomous and 20 dependent participants in each CG and EG). Their age ranged between 14 and 18 years old. Gender of participants was not considered as a variable in the study. Next, a metaphorical expression pretest was administered to all groups of the study and then the experimental group was given the metaphorical expressions via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Instagram</span> application, whereas the control group only followed conventional treatment. At the end, the posttest of L2 metaphorical expression was administered to both groups of the study and finally the data were analyzed. Analyzing the data through the one-way repeated measures ANOVA and ANCOVA revealed that utilizing <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Instagram</span> application had a positively significant effect on autonomous/dependent Iranian intermediate EFL learners’ pictorial metaphors learning. Furthermore, both autonomous and dependent students had a positive attitude toward using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Instagram</span> Application.</p>

The main purpose of this research was to explore the effects of ICT engagement factors on science performance across Singapore and Turkey conditional to the sufficient degree of measurement invariance of ICT engagement scale. The multi-group confirmatory factor analysis results demonstrated strong factorial invariance of ICT engagement scale across Singapore and Turkey, so we were able to use ICT engagement scale to meaningful and valid comparisons between these countries. After obtaining measurement invariance, a multi-group structural equation modeling was used for the comparison of the effects of ICT engagement factors on student’s performance of science between these two countries. While interest in ICT, perceived ICT competence and perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in using ICT have significant positive direct effect on science performance in both countries, the direct effect of social relatedness in using ICT on science performance is negative in both Singapore and Turkey. Also, when compared with Singapore, the effects of all ICT engagement constructs on student’s performance are higher in Turkey.

<p>In the recent rise of digital learning, “flipped classrooms” have become a controversial subject. This new form of learning inverts the traditional conception of the classroom: instruction is transferred from the classroom to out-of-class (online) tasks such as pre-recorded lectures on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, while class time is devoted to activities that put the knowledge into practice. These classrooms have been touted as learner-based and student-centered models of education. Yet there is still little evidence supporting the effectiveness of the flipped classroom at higher levels of education, especially in the humanities. Taking American studies as an example, I will examine some of the arguments in favor of this model, but also and most importantly some of the challenges facing the application of this new educational model in the humanities. In general, the main concern is that flipped classrooms may undermine student-teacher dialogue, viewing teachers as “moderators” who design learning environments geared to the students. At the same time, home-learning environments may compromise learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and limit learners’ opportunities for self-organized work and interaction with peers outside class. Ultimately, a critique of the concept of flipped classrooms is also a critique of the egalitarian aspirations of digital pedagogy in general.</p>

<p>The role of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s is vital in academia as interconnectivity in the classroom promotes learning <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, increases motivation, and enhances teaching and learning mobility. Using classroom research design, this study aimed to investigate the perspectives of Engineering students of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use in an academic writing course. The data were collected from students enrolled in a writing course in a top-ranked Science and Technology university in Thailand. Fifty students voluntarily submitted reflections towards the end of the semester. The study was qualitative, in which inductive coding was used. The findings elicited specific situations of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use in an academic writing course, for example, knowing and looking at the meaning of words, knowing the word form, finding information, taking notes, brainstorming with friends, using translation, and others. Two roles of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use were coded. The first role is facilitative, which has the following functions: resource-based, cognitive-based, memory-based, output-based, collaborative-based, entertainment-based, and communicative-based. Another is the debilitative role indicating two functions, such as sources of cognitive distraction and undesirable behaviors. Interestingly, self-regulation of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use in class was coded. Implications on how <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s can be used in teaching writing were also discussed.</p>

<p>&lt;p class=“0abstract”&gt;The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has brought the dependence on the online activities as new behaviors in various aspects of society including education. It defines the reliance upon <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> access for learning practices and the tendency toward learning <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Yet, the sudden emergence of the pandemic causes problematic circumstances for learners. Not all learners are ready to be autonomous and to have <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> infrastructure. Within this context, the current study addresses learners’ attitudes toward learning <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and examines what hinder them to be autonomous. As a descriptive research, this study involves 101 respondents living in Bitung city, a fast growing and harbor city in North Sulawesi, Eastern Indonesia. They are asked to fill the kind of Likert questionnaire which constitutes the source of data which are statistically analyzed. The results indicates that learners dominantly show positive attitude toward the idea of being autonomous in this pandemic era.

<p>The COVID-19 has put higher education institutions in a new situation and identified bottlenecks in the financial structure of institutions and education systems in general. However, for Ukrainian universities, this situation can be seen as an opportunity to achieve financial <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. This study is devoted to the consideration of a possible tool for the financial <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of Ukrainian classical universities, most of which are state-funded. The paper considers the methodology of a possible tool for the accumulation of external financing – the endowment fund. The case analysis and analytical consideration of world practice are applied. As a result, a model for financing the university in its transition to the innovation and entrepreneurship model is proposed as the chain “endowment fund – development of start-ups”. This example can become the basis of the road map for other national HEIs, as well as the practice of wider use in the field of higher education. However, despite most of the national classical universities have declared a course to an innovative development, which further raised the necessity of external funding, top management and general economic situation require more attention. As this transition to a new model of the university is taking place along with the financial stabilization and under economic and social upheavals, the formation of a new culture of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communication</span> is necessary. Thus, the proposed model is the practical guideline of possible decisions but mostly the start-point for further discussion and research. AcknowledgmentThis paper is done in the framework of the grant project “Financial stabilization of classical universities in the context of the global consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic” funded by the National Research Foundation of Ukraine “Science for Human Security and Society” (2020-2021).</p>

<p>Learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is the ability and responsibility of learners to take control of their learning. Motivation, the chance to work independently and/ or collaboratively, access to the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and library, and challenging tasks promote learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. This study explores English language teachers’ perceptions and practices on learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and finds the difference in the perceptions and practices by their sex, level, qualification, and type of school they teach. One hundred thirty-three (133) teachers teaching at Tulsipur Sub-metropolitan Dang, Nepal, were selected using the fishbowl technique. Data drawn with the questionnaire’s help were analysed via univariate (frequency, percentage, and median) and bivariate (t-test and Cohen’s d) analysis. From the analyses, it was found that English language teachers teaching at different levels are aware of the what, why, and how of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and they promote learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> by engaging and encouraging students to be involved in the tasks which promote learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Perceptions on learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> do not differ by their sex, level, qualification, and type of school they teach. Likewise, practices on learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> also do not differ by the sex and level of the teachers, but their practices differ by the type of school where they teach and their qualification.</p>

<p>The predominance of English in the media, particularly on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>, have been responsible for driving change in language education policy and there is a global trend towards introducing English language teaching into the system of education.The introduction of web 2.0 network services in language education is one of the promising areas of informatization of the educational process, which helps to foster a stable communication competence in the students and design formative assessment under the guidance of an experienced teacher. Modern digital technologies with the transition to a more communicative approach offer new forms of assessments that were not available to us even ten years ago. Students have the opportunity to record videos while interacting in groups or even working on a monologue or story. Students often practice uploading podcasts and audio files and creating diary and wiki entries.The article deals with the benefits of digital technology during teaching English, which opens new perspectives on the assessment. The research describes the stages of the organization of assessment in the classroom, emphasizes the importance of feedback on testing, examines some factors that affect the teaching of English in terms of its assessment, gives an overview of the benefits of using washback effect and lists the problems associated with the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies. The author explores the potential of using formative and summative assessments as well as the feedback to improve students’ academic achievement and progress. Digital technology and assessment help us to achieve some of our goals: improved motivation, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> or closer cooperation between students, and so on. In addition, feedback can even be provided by students themselves, which contributes to the formation of self-assessment. Consequently, it becomes obvious what should be changed in the course on the basis of the assessment of students’ progress during the learning cycle.There is a lack of professionalism in the use of some <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies, which negatively affects the effectiveness of assessment systems of English.

<p>Individuals with high self-concept will likely have high life satisfaction, they easily get adjusted to life, and they communicate their feeling more appropriately. However, it was not certain whether self-concept would decline or improve as individuals age, or whether self-concept would vary between genders and ethnic groups. To prove, a study was carried out to compare the self-concept of college students in an Asian context. The inquiry utilized the cross-sectional design in finding out significant differences in the self-concept of participants in terms of age, gender, and ethnicity. A 22-item questionnaire was adapted and administered to 222 Bachelor of Public Administration and Bachelor of Science in Business Administration students from the satellite campus of Bukidnon State University in the Philippines. Initially, a sample was randomly drawn from the population. During the actual data collection, the researchers had difficulty getting the responses from the randomly selected individuals due to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> connection and it was done amidst a pandemic. Instead, it took all responses from those who were available, have access to the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>, and could accomplish the google forms. The data were analyzed using Mean, Standard Deviation, T-test for independent sample, ANOVA and Post Hoc test. The results revealed that college students at the locale have a high level of self-concept in self-fulfilment, emotional adjustment, and honesty. Yet, they only had a moderate level of self-concept in <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Further, there were significant differences in college students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and honesty in terms of age and gender. Furthermore, there were significant differences in their emotional adjustment and self-fulfilment as to their ethnicity. The results have implications for instruction, administration, guidance services, and future research.</p>

<p>This study aimed to investigate the perception of on-site students of the Accounting Sciences Program of a public university that adopted emergency remote learning during the Covid-19 pandemic in Brazil, highlighting the aspects that favor or hinder learning. A qualitative and descriptive study was carried out, with data collected through 4 focus groups with the participation of 80 students from an on-site undergraduate program in Accounting Sciences. The results indicate that the students perceive the structural factors (flexibility in the deadlines for delivery of activities), personal and collective factors (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the learning process) and didactic-pedagogical factors (use of active methodologies by the professor) as facilitating aspects of the remote education. As for the aspects that hinder learning, we highlight external factors (lack of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> access), individual factors (not maintaining a study routine and increased stress levels) and traditional remote education (monotonous videoconference classes). Finally, an optimistic vision for future trends is observed, with changes in the human aspects (change of paradigm of the student’s role), institutional aspects (greater use of technology) and formative aspects (use of active methodologies). It is concluded that the use of active methodologies in the didactic and pedagogical aspect raises the participation of the number of students in remote classes and improves the quality of learning. This study can contribute to educational institutions that adopt emergency remote education for continuity of academic activities in periods of crisis, as well as to professors who plan their activities. It emphasizes the role of the professor and the importance of active methodologies in the development of knowledge.</p>

<p>Abstract International engagement has become a priority and is regarded as a means to improve the quality of students’ education and their future social and professional success. It may, however, pose a major challenge for some higher education students. One of the vulnerable groups is that of learners with special needs, and particularly Deaf, deaf and hard of hearing students. These learners are limited in their chances to interact in spoken/written foreign languages and in the learning opportunities they can join. This, by extension, has an unfavourable impact on their possibilities of engaging in study abroad. Based on the experience with a newly launched e-learning course “Online English for International Mobilities”, the present paper discusses the need for building effective FL learning strategies in Deaf, deaf and hard of hearing students in connection with the process of academic internationalisation. The main argument is for the need to foster students’ ability to self-regulate, reduce their teacher dependency and reliance on directed learning, and to encourage them to take responsibility for their own learning. Secondly, the paper provides a comparison of two pilot runs of the course from the perspective of (online) classroom dynamics and cooperation. While the course is built to be as autonomous as possible and benefits from the advantages of the e-learning format, great importance is given to group dynamics and cooperation via discussion forums and online <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>s. It also takes advantage of the considerable benefits of individualized, personalized feedback being provided by teachers on selected assignments.</p>

<p>E-learning has taken centre stage during this period of social distancing and lockdowns, in the current pandemic, by enabling education to continue. There are perceptibly no limitations to the utility of e-learning tools in the cognitive domain of learning. It complements traditional learning in other domains, namely, psychomotor, affective and communication skill, fairly well. Not only does it ease learning in terms of availability and accessibility, but with the options of asynchronous learning and personalisation of content, it also empowers learners with more <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Despite the limitation of lack of ‘hands-on’ training and experience with e-learning, it has been accepted quite well, although initially both teachers and learners had been skeptical about its applicability and quality. In the ongoing pandemic period, e-learning may assume a bigger role as blended learning in medical education. While this transition may be smooth for the better resourced nations who already have the required infrastructure and resources ready, the resource limited nations may first have to develop the same before being able to implement it. Ensuring the availability of cheap and high-speed <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>, computers in various forms (desktops, laptops, tablets and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s) within reach of every learner, will enable them to go online.</p>

<p>With the deep integration of “<span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> + education” and the continuous advancement of education reform, blended teaching has become the main method of university education reform. Blended education combines the advantages of traditional education and online education to complement each other. It not only takes advantage of the flexibility and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of online education but also retains the benefits of emotional communication between teachers and students in offline education. With the increase in practical exploration of blended teaching in universities, teaching evaluation is an important part of teaching, and blended teaching evaluation should also attract attention. The purpose of this paper is to study the mixed oral English teaching evaluation based on the mixed mode of SPOC and deep learning. On the basis of analyzing the teaching design principles of the mixed mode of SPOC and deep learning and the principles of constructing the teaching evaluation after half a semester of teaching investigations conducted by the two classes of English majors, the impact of the SPOC and deep learning mixed teaching mode on students’ spoken English was studied through the method of covariance analysis. The experimental results show that the mixed teaching mode of SPOC and deep learning has been able to fully stimulate students’ interest in oral English learning and improve students’ oral English ability, critical thinking of students, ability to solve problems, group cooperation, and effective communication. Self-directed learning and self-reflection have all had a positive impact.</p>

<p>Computational Thinking (CT) is considered one of the most needed abilities of the 21st Century as the usage of digital resources has become more and more frequent. Research on CT teaching has been growing over the last decade and Brazilian initiatives have focused on Elementary and High School students while less privileged audiences, such as non-literate citizens, are rarely addressed. The lack of literacy affects more than communication, but <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for economic, cultural and educational development, social interaction, and also the experience with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y. Non-literate citizens represent more than 11 million people in Brazil, and Youth and Adults Education (YAE) is an educational modality offered to these citizens. In this article, we present the main results from a Master’s research that investigated CT as a means to reduce YAE’s students’ rejection and fear of technology, aware of their characteristics, contexts, and particularities. In our research, we consider that through the practice of CT people can comprehend how technology works and how it can be used, favoring familiarity, and reducing rejection and fear of technology. Grounded on Computing and Education literature, we conceived a model to plan and conduct initiatives for YAE, applying and studying our model in a case study conducted inside a Brazilian public school during 8 workshops with 17 participants. For the case study, 9 principles to support the practice with YAE students were identified and used to inform 12 activities created/adapted for practicing CT throughout the workshops. A research overview is presented, along with its theoretical grounds to the main results from the case study and lessons learned. Results show the model as promising to inform practices to exercise CT abilities, sensitive to the audience’s context.</p>

<p>This phenomenological study explores how English language teachers become <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) literate and why they make use of ICT in English language class and find out challenges in integrating ICT in English language teaching (ELT). For this purpose, two secondary-level English teachers were selected purposively, and in-depth interviews were conducted to collect data. The collected data were analyzed using the thematic analysis technique. The findings drawn from the lived experience of the teachers reveal that teachers become ICT literate and updated by taking formal classes, training, and teaching their students; they make use of ICT in ELT for students’ language development, motivation, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The challenge of keeping the students on the right track is the major challenge English language teachers encounter while integrating ICT in ELT. Though there are challenges, every English language teacher should try to teach the English language integrating ICT.</p>

<p>New educational technologies offer the potential to affect service to all learners, but especially adult learners. Because of this fact, adult educators have become enamored by the possibilities offered through the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, distance education, and computers in general. Recently, Adult Learning covered this topic several times. Key research trends deal with the following issues: How much do the new technologies improve access to adult education? Are they as good, in terms of learning outcomes, as more traditional approaches? Are they better than traditional approaches? Are they appropriate for certain groups and not others? If so, what are the parameters of these differences? Are some groups excluded by the heightened emphasis on learning via distance and/or by computer? What are the policy implications of these findings? This column begins an examination of the meaning of new technologies both to educators and the general public. At every turn, there are those who hailed technological breakthroughs as the ultimate panacea; the point at which access will finally be opened and the hurdles to learning will evaporate. It is useful to remember that the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and computers are part of a long chain of innovations that have simultaneously promised diffusion and the possibility of interaction. Of course, the first in this chain of diffusion was the printing press, followed by the lending library, which was not a technological innovation. The lending library is still viewed as a democratic invention that encourages the spread of knowledge. Andrew Carnegie, whose Corporation would later be so instrumental in funding organized adult education, had as his primary philanthropic mission the establishment of public libraries. In terms of modern efforts at technology and diffusion, the telephone at one time was hailed as a new educational invention, followed by movies, radio, and television. All offered the potential of allowing people to continue their learning in a convenient fashion, with the possibility of immediate access. The library, nonetheless, preceded all of these. While each provide important sources of diffusion, none live up to the promise of diffusing information to every corner of society. Yet the dream continues. Those writing about the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> emphasize the possibility it offers for immediate access to information. The new wrinkle, of course is the opportunity for immediate feedback and discussion, which earlier innovations did not possess. This is not quite true, however, since back in the nineteenth century, the telephone possessed the same potential. While all of education is subject to fads, it seems that adult education has more than its share. This is probably due to adult education’s lack of an organized structure with its’ built-in system of control. As many writers indicate, this allows for greater flexibility, but it also precludes the development of a coherent vision. A field without a sense of vision cannot really develop, it merely spurts ahead in many different directions. What, then is the vision presented by the new technologies? This vision is quite simple and embodies principles that define efforts at adult education and diffusion for over one hundred years. They present the possibility of education on demand. The dream is that when computers become the norm, people will be able to access information from all over the world. This is the notion that somehow the wires of technology will replace the older traditions that connected people to each other. …</p>

<p>AbstractIn the present article various aspects of higher education challenges in Iran are discussed with keeping an eye on curricula and pedagogical practices from the Islamic perspective. It is clearly argued that Longstanding Problems such as faculty quality, Problems Faced by Students and Insufficient Resources and <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> are the most significant challenges of higher education in Iran. New Realities resulted from new revolutions such as the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and distance learning are also playing vital role in shaping the new higher education era in Iran.IntroductionToday, global wealth is concentrated less and less in factories, land, tools, and machinery. The knowledge, skills, and resourcefulness of people are increasingly critical to the world economy. Human capital in the United States is now estimated to be at least three times more important than physical capital. A century ago, this would not have been the case (Emily Hannun &amp; Claudia Buchmann, 2003). The developed world is reacting quickly, with education a major political priority. High-quality human capital is developed in high-quality education systems, with tertiary education providing the advanced skills that command a premium in today’s workplace (College Board, 2004).Most developed countries have seen a substantial rise in the proportion of their young people receiving higher education. Lifelong learning is also being used to help workers adjust to rapidly changing economies (International Comparisons of 4-year College Continuation Rates, 2001). During the past two or three decades, however, attention has focused on primary education, especially for girls. This has led to a neglect of secondary and tertiary education, with higher education in a perilous state in many, if not most, developing countries. With a few notable exceptions, it is underfunded by governments and donors. As a result, quality is low and often deteriorating, while access remains limited. Higher education institutions (and whole systems) are politicized, poorly regulated, and sometimes corrupt (Burton Bollag, 2004).We believe that a more balanced approach to education at all levels is needed. The focus on primary education is important, but an approach that pursues primary education alone will leave societies dangerously unprepared for survival in tomorrow’s world. We live in a period of major structural change. The classic industrial revolution that started in the United Kingdom at the end of the eighteenth century spread gradually and unevenly to Europe and beyond (United Joint Economic Committee States Congress, 2000). By the end of the twentieth century, a number of so-called follower countries had joined the ranks of industrial nations, and today industrial countries are found throughout the world. Some have narrowed, and even closed, the gap between rich and poor, with the East Asian countries being a good example. Average incomes have tended to increase across the world (except in Sub-Saharan Africa) in the past 20 years, although one-quarter of the world’s population still lives in abject poverty. Advances in information technology, meanwhile, have made this ever-increasing volume of knowledge more accessible, effective, and powerful. Networked computers and new forms of telecommunications spread information around the world with dazzling speed (Steven J. Rosenstone &amp; John Mark Hansen, 2003).The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, in particular, means that more knowledge than ever is in circulation. Those who have the skills to use it have access to an extraordinarily valuable (and sustainable) resource (Emily Hannun &amp; Claudia Buchmann, 2004).Longstanding Problems and New Realities Faculty QualityA well-qualified and highly motivated faculty is critical to the quality of higher education institutions. Unfortunately, even at flagship universities in developing countries, many faculty members have little, if any, graduate-level training. This limits the level of knowledge imparted to students and restricts the students’ ability to access existing knowledge and generate new ideas (Heath A. …</p>

<p>The article focuses on studying the modern trends of digital transformation of the management system of institutions of additional education of schoolchildren. Theoretical and methodological provisions have been scientifically substantiated and practical recommendations have been developed to improve the management system of additional education of schoolchildren in the context of digital transformations. It is proved that the institution of extracurricular education is also a community characterized by dedication, formal and informal structures, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, cyclicality, freedom of choice of extracurricular activities. For the first time it was proposed to use a system-<span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netic approach to the strategic management of institutions of additional education of schoolchildren based on the procedural model of strategic management and the information management system, tested in the management system of Russian Childrenʼs Center “Ocean”. It is proved that Management Information Systems (MIS) uses the information necessary for top managers at all levels in making operational, tactical and strategic decisions. The advantages and positive factors for institutions of the sphere of additional education of schoolchildren from the introduction of MIS within the boundaries of the procedural model of strategic management are highlighted. The characteristic features of the management activities of the subjects of management of institutions of additional education of schoolchildren are outlined. There are presented the management models, the knowledge of which will provide the heads of organizations of extracurricular education with data on selecting MIS. The importance of further development of the theory, methodology and practice in the strategic management of additional education of schoolchildren in the context of digital transformations has been proved.</p>

<p>Although the research results of mobile teaching mode at home and abroad have been involved in all aspects of education and teaching and provided a lot of useful reference for subsequent researchers, the lack of research on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">WeChat</span> interactive translation teaching mode makes the practical research in this field urgent. As China’s education industry continues to pursue international development, it is necessary to train a large number of international talents who have an international perspective, are familiar with international rules, and can participate in international affairs and international competition. However, to become an international talent, you must first have superior English communication skills and be able to deal with various international situations proficiently. The English education goals at the basic education stage are simply beyond reach and can only be cultivated through professional and systematic college English courses. This shows that college English education is at a crucial position in the future development of education. This study attempts to explore how to apply the interactive teaching mode supported by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">WeChat</span> network platform in translation teaching and English learning of high school students, so as to improve students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in translation practice, promote students’ personalized learning, and improve students’ interest and ability in English learning. Based on the investigation of a senior high school in our city, the school began to implement the interactive translation mobile teaching mode based on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">WeChat</span> in September 2018. The experiment selected the change of students’ English learning achievements in a certain semester and judged whether the mobile teaching mode was conducive to the improvement of learning performance based on t-test. We also need to collect the needs of teachers and parents for the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">WeChat</span> based mobile teaching mode and judge whether the mode can be promoted. The experimental results show that this teaching mode has an obvious effect on the improvement of students’ English scores, especially in the eighth grade, whose scores have increased from 72.6 to 75. Through the construction of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">WeChat</span> based interactive translation mobile teaching mode, parents can fully understand the key points of English learning and make English tutoring more targeted and timely. This teaching mode is worthy of promotion in senior high school English course learning.</p>

This study explores the mechanism influencing the use of ICT on students’ science literacy. We utilized two-level hierarchical linear models and structural equation models to analyze data collected from the 2015 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) in China. Results indicate that student-level and school-level ICT factors, in particular ICT interest, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in using ICT, and ICT availability at school positively impact the development of students’ science literacy. Further, we found some notable interactions between school-level factors and student-level ICT variables. Moreover, there are structural relationships among ICT availability, ICT emotional perception, ICT learning usage behaviors, science self-efficacy, and science literacy. We also found that teacher-delivered science instruction has a negative moderating effect on ICT learning usage and science self-efficacy. These findings have important implications of how to integrate ICT in future science teaching practices.</p>

<p>The health and education sectors have experienced rapid technological development. In this scenario, the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> technology has grown as an option for the expansion of continuing education (CE), as it allows professionals to develop educational activities with flexibility, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and convenience. E-learning has gained popularity and currently, thousands of online courses are being offered. However, studies of e-learning in professional training have presented only a few specific foci of study.to develop a comprehensive approach to understand both the experience and the complex scenario of the use of e-learning in the CE for pharmacists.Field research in 10 Brazilian states through interviews and focus groups with alumni of a CE e-learning specialization course for pharmacists in public health. Data analysis used the model of socio-technical systems and was based on a framework with the components Objectives, People, Processes, Culture, Technology, Infrastructure, and Scenario.The People and Culture components indicated the assimilation and normalization of technologies in the educational process. Although the infrastructure (technical and organizational) was deficient in some regions, the Technology component suggested that the characteristics of the course design, associated with the personal characteristics of the students, provided ways to overcome obstacles. The objectives of the use of distance education seem to be related to the possibility of greater accessibility and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The Processes component, in turn, revealed the burden that a e-learning course puts on the pharmacist.E-learning proved to be useful to enable and expand access to education, providing pharmacists with an opportunity for CE. On the other hand, e-learning contributes to the normalization of the precarious working conditions of pharmacists, attributing to individuals the sole responsibility for the CE even in an institutional CE program, which results in work overload.</p>

<p>&lt;p class=“AuthorInfo”&gt;In the modern society, the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> breaks through the restrictions on time and space and becomes a ubiquitous learning tool. Designing teaching activity for digital learning and flexibly applying technology tools are the key issues for current information technology integrated education. Interactive learning modules could be used in the classroom environment for effective learning. This study explored the effect of instructional modules for providing supplementary instruction in biology concepts. Interactive digital learning module was developed in order to assist students in biology learning. Interactive activities were considered in this study, include teacher – student interaction, student - student interaction, student - content interaction, and student - technology interaction. 180 students of Grade 11 in 6 classes at SMAN 2 Balige were selected as the research subjects. Three groups of students participated in biology learning course, (2 classes) using different modules were interactive digital module, digital module and text module. Goal of this research was to determine the impact of interactive digital learning module on students’ learning activity and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Quantitative results obtained by using questionnaire to understand the student’s learning activity and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Results showed student’s activities and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> who learned with interactive digital learning modules significantly different with students who learned using text learning modules. The use of interactive features increased the activity and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of learners and created the student-centered learning environment. Students under interactive multimedia instruction performed better than text module class. These findings suggested that learning activity and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of students in biology could be enhanced by multimedia instruction.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>The article considers what is a philosophy and its relation to education . The modern academic development of philosophy has questioned the theoretical basis of specific aspects of knowledge and human experience, including education. It is an active rather than a passive or descriptive discipline. Education is defined similarly as a process by which knowledge, skills (including collecting empirical evidence and reasoning from it), cultural norms, values, and beliefs are acquired. The development of the modern philosophy of education is considered with its emphasis on conceptual analysis. Education is philosophically the conscious development of maturity requiring capacity for both intellectual and economic <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Issues in the contemporary philosophy of education are then considered, particularly the challenges of post-modernism and post-truth for a philosophy of education in an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> world. It identifies the need for comparative philosophical perspectives other than Occidental ones and suggests philosophical anthropology and comparative education as potential guides. It concludes that although there is now no consensus on how a coherent contemporary philosophy of education may be developed, analysis of concepts, metaphysical reasoning, and ethics may still provide a basis for a coherent and defensible philosophy of education whatever the comparative cultural setting.</p>

<p>Evolving <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) reshapes people’s reading activities by popularizing digital reading. Past studies focused on the relationships between students’ frequency of ICT use and reading performance but neglected the possible interrelationships between students’ ICT-related psychological factors, school contextual factors, and reading performance. This study applied the Self-determination Theory (SDT) to explore the relationships between students’ ICT-related psychological factors (perceived interest, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and social interaction in using ICT) and reading performance. The possible moderation effects of schools’ contextual variables (schools’ support in ICT devices and schools’ support in teachers’ capacity to integrate technology in teaching) were also investigated. Data from 222,293 secondary students from 10,103 schools in 47 economies who participated in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018 were analyzed using three-level hierarchical linear modeling. The results provided support for the SDT by confirming the positive correlations between students’ ICT-related interest, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and competence and reading performance, and the accentuating moderation effect of schools’ contextual factors. However, students’ perceived social interaction in ICT use was negatively correlated with reading performance, and this negative correlation worsened with increasing schools’ support in ICT devices while buffered with increasing schools’ support in teachers’ capacity to use technology.</p>

<p>Background: Respiratory care (RC) is a healthcare discipline that specializes in providing treatment for patients with acute and chronic cardiopulmonary abnormalities. Today, RC possesses a solid skill base and an expansive depth of knowledge, enabling them to provide safe, team-based, evidence-based effective care for patients. This study explores perceptions of RC students (RCS), RC faculty (RCF), and RC professionals (RCP) regarding Interprofessional Education (IPE) and Interprofessional Practice (IPP). Additionally, it identifies factors that affect perceptions of knowledge, skills, and abilities related to IPE and IPP among RCS, RCF, and RCP.
 Methods: A mixed method (embedded) design was used. An online <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> survey questionnaire was <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>ed to the program directors to distribute it among their students, alumni, and faculty. The total of 421 program directors were reached via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>. Three hundred forty-five surveys were returned, with 208 surveys eligible for analysis.
 Results: The findings showed a significant main effect of professional status on the Interdisciplinary Education Perception Scale (IEPS) overall score regardless of the IPE exposure. However, there was no significant difference in the average score on the competency and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, perceived need for cooperation, or perception of actual cooperation. Qualitatively, it was revealed that simulation was the most useful IPE experience for promoting IPP. Additional factors such as time, attitude, experiences, cooperation, and cost were believed to affect the infusion of IPE into the academic environment.
 Conclusion: Regardless of the status of RCS and RCPs exposure to IPE during their professional education, all perceived IPE as positively supporting IPP. Qualitatively, for those directly exposed to IPE, simulation was identified as the most useful IPE experience for promoting IPP.
 Recommendations: IPE should be continued implemented as a strategy for the promotion of IPP, as well as the necessity for further documentation and assessment of the IPE techniques used in the academy to guarantee learning outcome accountability.</p>

<p>Recently, Covid-19 has threatened the education sector and forced learners to adjust an online learning. According to that, learners need to study in their own space and make them more independent and autonomous. However, learners tend to experience difficulties caused by their surrounding environments that sometimes does not support online learning. Surrounding environments include human activities e.g., noise in the surrounding; financial capabilities of parents for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> data plans; or other issues beyond the student’s intellectual abilities. Therefore, this research aimed to explore the existed environmental factors that affected the learning environment and define the factors which affected learners’ volition. This study was applied a qualitative method and presenting the collected results descriptively. The researcher worked with one English teacher who has been voluntarily participating in this study. This study used semi-structured interview and questionnaire as the research instruments. Firstly, the researcher sent the questionnaires using Google Form for all students at 11th graders from one of the government-owned senior high schools in Surabaya. Secondly, the researcher interviewed an English teacher to find out the class’ conditions. This study has revealed that teacher still holds huge responsibilities to guide students along the online learning process. Besides, there were still a lacks IT skills of students which make the teacher not only a facilitator but also a helper or counsellor. This dominant role of the teacher eventually made students less autonomous.</p>

<p>The significance of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in today’s English Language Teaching (ELT) context has been well recognized and confirmed by many research findings; however, in some cases in which independent learning is not well established, the implementation may not be easy. Thus, this research is intended to provide data on teachers’ readiness and challenges in promoting learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> during online learning activities. This research employed quantitative and qualitative data collection. The quantitative data were gained by a survey that has been conducted to 38 English teachers in 38 junior high schools in Bengkulu. In addition, the qualitative data were collected from an interview that has also been carried out to six teachers. The quantitative data obtained were then analysed through descriptive statistics analysis in the form of percentages and frequency. Meanwhile, the qualitative data were analysed by using thematic analysis. The results showed that in general most teachers were ready to build learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in ICT-based English learning. Most teachers used various methods in online teaching, gave freedom for the students to access different online resources according to their interest, found it easy to carry out online learning, yet most of them did not prefer to implement online learning activities. In the implementation, some challenges were faced by teachers, including poor <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> connection, students’ different characteristics, and lack support from school policymakers.</p>

<p>The development of the literature on teacher leadership in the academic realm has been exponential, but the quest for more leadership knowledge seems to be inexhaustible. The purpose of this paper is to analyze teachers’ perceptions with respect to their leadership abilities. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Email</span> interviews were conducted with nine teachers from two primary and two secondary schools to obtain their views regarding teacher leadership, whilst affording them opportunities to make suggestions for collaborative teacher leadership development. Having employed a phenomenological approach and thematic analysis as method, this paper proposes a collaborative teacher leadership development framework (CTLDF). Significant about the CTLDF is that teacher leaders should consider ausgang as a way of opening the door for collaboration, homo economicus as a collaborative act and parrhesia as <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> towards collaborative teacher leadership. The findings reveal that teacher leaders should cultivate a readiness to create opportunities for collaborative leadership development. The study recommends that teacher leaders should first have to be cognizant about their own individual strengths, whilst slowly starting initiatives to collaborate in order to sustain improvements in teacher leadership practices.</p>

<p>Mobile-assisted Language Learning (MALL) has been globally popular. Yet, experimental studies investigating the results of different treatments between additional MALL and standard MALL implementations in Indonesian university context are still understudied. This research sought to investigate the extent to which additional MALL activities as a treatment to an EFL experimental group of university students could improve their English given the limited class time and large sized classes. The subjects of this study were two second semester classes of English Literature students. The experimental class, a low-performing group, was asked to watch a youtube video twice or thrice a week in addition to the standard online learning during the Covid-19 pandemic while the controlled class, a better performing group, was not given this treatment. The findings revealed that (1) experimental students significantly improved their pronunciation, intonation, vocabulary and fluency but not their formal assessment results; (2) though assigned additional MALL activities, the experimental group, due to limited financial ability for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>, spent roughly as much time as the controlled group; ((3) bad <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> connection and low economic affordability contributed significantly to the less satisfactory result of MALL; (4) due to the standard online learning during the pandemic, both experimental and controlled students experienced increased exposures, enthusiasm, motivation, range of independent activites, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and English ability; (5) real time students’ collaboration is challenging. This study suggests that MALL somehow allows greater English improvement and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> development and therefore is recommended that universities and respective local governments especially in remote areas provide the necessary supports.</p>

<p>Technology-enhanced collaborative writing (TECW) for second language development is receiving increasing research attention from educators and teachers. However, there have been few review studies investigating how teachers implement this activity, how they use technology for the implementation, and what challenges they have. To better prepare practitioners to use digital tools for collaborative writing among their students, we reviewed 42 relevant studies focusing on their implementation identifying nine main TECW practices. These include: receiving teacher training; grouping students; training students on collaboration; training students on technology; providing students with new knowledge of writing; monitoring processes and giving immediate help; providing sufficient <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to students; evaluating outcomes and giving feedback; and encouraging students’ reflection. Technology could support TECW implementation by expediting information delivery, developing group workspaces and group <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>rooms, recording students’ writing and collaboration behaviours and visualising their thoughts, enabling teacher commentary and information post, and presenting organised, analysed records of the TECW process. Challenges to TECW included: students’ reluctance to collaborate and difficulties using new technology. Based on the review, we argue that teachers can influence the implementation of TECW from cognitive, metacognitive, behavioural, and motivational aspects. Teacher training, student <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and the size of writing groups are potential areas for future research in TECW.</p>

<p>This paper explores Hungarian university students’ autonomous learning behaviors during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Hungary (March-June 2020). A self-developed questionnaire was used to explore some aspects of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> relying on the action-oriented dimensions of Tassinari’s (2015) dynamic model of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The present paper aimed to investigate how university students in Hungary regulated their learning processes during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020 with regards to three <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>y (ICT)-based teaching modes. Based on a quantitative study of the constructs of goal setting, management of the learning process and monitoring of efficiency, the researchers examine to what extent students were capable of adapting, through the exercise of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, to challenges posed by the altered learning environment. Results of the study also show that participants had different perceptions of the three teaching modes and that students’ exercise of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> influenced their perception of these ICT-based teaching modes.</p>

<p>The world has witnessed democratic decline in 23 countries worldwide during the last decade (Freedom House, 2019) in the context of rising nationalism and right-wing populism (Fraser, 2017; Robertson, 2018, 2020). The political importance of this topic is rooted in the fact that higher education is one of the most crucial public goods (Marginson, 2007, 2017) and governments tend to exercise tighter control over HEIs while democratic conditions worsening (Perry, 2015). Although many studies have examined the effects of the transition to democracy on higher education globally (O’Donnell et al., 2013; O’Donnell et al., 1986, Salto, 2020), very few have studied the reverse trend – democratic backsliding. Given that university <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is a wider term that encompasses the practises undertaken by universities to operate, researching its aspects, and assessing the true implications of democratic backsliding on universities represents an important field for current and future research.
 My research investigates the impact of democratic backsliding on the university <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, by examining the cases of Turkey, Hungary, and Poland. These countries were considered democracies until the 2010s, but they are increasingly moving away from democracy (Freedom House, 2020). The study draws on an extensive analysis of publicly accessible government laws and regulations, university decrees, mission statements, political pamphlets, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online media</span> sources and interviews, and grey literature to analyze institutional responses as well as field work and interviews. I employ neoliberal authoritarianism and historical institutionalism as a framework to investigate the critical junctures and institutional changes affecting appointive (hiring, promotion, and dismissal of staff), financial (funding levels and criteria, preparation and allocation of the university budget, and accountability), and academic (access, curriculum, degree requirements, and academic freedom) <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (Ordorika, 2003).</p>

<p>Middle school brings rapid developmental changes for adolescents, and parent engagement is as essential as ever. However, what worked for parent-teacher partnerships in elementary school doesn’t fit so well in middle school. Adolescents are building their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and teachers must help empower parents’ efforts to bolster students as independent learners through academic socialization. The authors explore how a brief <span style="background-color:lightgreen">texting</span> intervention might build trust between teachers and parents, empower parents to support their children, and contribute to students’ confidence and belonging in school. Results indicate that brief communications sent by text may bolster parent engagement efforts in middle school.</p>

<p>Abstract Introduction: The number of two-to three-year-old children using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s was 10% in 2013 compared to 40% in 2017 (Konok, Bunford, &amp; Miklósi, 2020). Several theoretical and empirical studies deal with the didactics of using modern technology in the classroom. Most studies highlight the neutral (Zsolnai, 2017) or positive impact of using ICT in the classroom. Only a few address the negative effects of digitally enhanced learning (Dávila, Casabayó, &amp; Rayburn, 2018; Livingstone, 2012; Lorenzo &amp; Trujillo, 2018). State education has continually tried to integrate modern technology with education, but there are also examples of institutional restrictions on its use and even a total ban can also be found. Purpose: This study provides an overview of the pedagogical and epistemological reasons why Waldorf pedagogy and Waldorf Steiner schools take a critical approach to the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICT) and to “screens” in general, together with mapping out the current state of Waldorf schools in Hungary. Methods: In the present study, we applied source analysis as a traditional research method in the philosophy of education. Conclusions: The findings show that the institutional use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies entirely contradicts the basis, tasks and spirit of Waldorf pedagogy. If we look at the epistemology and anthroposophical anthropology of Waldorf pedagogy, we can see that the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of a Waldorf teacher is not limitless, and so a continuous practical and theoretical responsibility of the Waldorf movement and Waldorf teachers is to establish and uphold coherence between the practices of every Waldorf institution and Waldorf pedagogy.</p>

<p>Teachers are expected to encourage students to be active in the learning process in line with social-constructivist principles. However, when it comes to their own learning, they are obliged to attend activities organized by their institution. Triggered by this dilemma, this study introduced <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Computer-Mediated</span> Communication as an alternative to the top-down delivery of trainer-fronted professional development and explored teachers’ uptake of Web 2.0 in the pre-pandemic era. To obtain comprehensive insights into teachers’ perceptions related to the use of Web 2.0 for their own learning, the study employed qualitative and quantitative methodology. Study results revealed that teacher development cannot be promoted with the use of Web 2.0 per se as it is very much dependent on teacher awareness, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, beliefs, contextual realities but most significantly student learning. Despite limitations, this study highlights the principle of learner-centeredness as the key for promoting teacher development and the need to make prospective teacher learning practices an integral part of student-focused activity. Based on the results of the study, it is recommended that the multi-dimensional nature of teacher learning and contextual realities at multiple levels are considered in the design of post-pandemic teacher development schemes, significantly in institutions with low-<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> cultures in order to turn top-down teacher development practices which teachers are used to into teacher initiated bottom-up learning processes.</p>

<p>The paper demonstrates the feasibility of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICT) in English as a foreign language (EFL) teaching and learning process. The organizational and pedagogical approaches to efficient EFL learning in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic have been outlined. Furthermore, the main perspectives and challenges appearing in an online learning environment have been characterized. The proposed paper aims to consider the possibility of integrating innovative computer technologies into online foreign language learning to foster students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and boost their language proficiency. The findings suggest that using ICT is beneficial for mastering a foreign language in out-of-class settings. Admittedly, there is no perfect or universal blend that may suit all the EFL learning environments. Therefore, it is claimed that blended programs should be created for each academic course regarding students’ wants, needs, and abilities. Furthermore, each higher educational institution needs to have a strategy for designing and implementing a distance EFL learning program that considers instructional, pedagogical, and technological factors.</p>

<p>This mixed methods study examines the way online resources can be effective in developing the learning <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> metacognitive skills of planning, monitoring, and self-evaluation among undergraduate students at the Facultyof Letters and Humanities Fes-Agdal, which is representative of the socio-cultural and higher education system of Morocco. The sample consisted of an experimental group and a control group. The experimental group consisted of 120 students who were exposed to three main online tools (Newsela.com, mrnussbaum.com, and rewordify.com), with virtual meetings and instruction provided through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>. The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> groups were kept secret, with only participants joining. The control group consisted of 120 students that benefited only from the university’s regular reading courses. The experimental intervention period was followed by interviews with a sample of 25 students from both groups, providing a qualitative perspective. The overall results suggest that online resources have a positive effect on the development of metacognitive skills. Students tend to appreciate the inclusion of online resources in the classroom without devaluing the role of their EFL teacher – the students did not expect online resources to fully replace the role of their teachers.Keywords: EFL online learning <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>; learning <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>; online resources; teaching and learning in higher education</p>

<p>Writing is a complex language skill, and writing using English as a medium for employment purposes requires an intricate set of knowledge and skills. Because such a writing process frequently occurs outside of a formal learning setting, few attempts to study the phenomenon have been made. Through the lens of the activity theory, the paper analyses the influence of six components in a CV writing process from a social-constructivist approach. A mixed-method approach was adopted with a Likert scale survey with open-ended questions and semi-structured interviews. Quantitative data from 184 participants revealed that students were mostly influenced by various digital artifacts (e.g., online dictionaries, online courses) and situated in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>ies of learning. Qualitative results also indicate the prominent challenges relating to syntax and lexical use as one the conflicting factors and a certain level of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> as a facilitating factor while they managed to overcome these complications. The paper suggests how the curriculum of Business English could be adapted to support language learners in real-life employment situations.</p>

<p>With the continuous development of science and technology, network technology has become more and more advanced and network applications are widely used in all walks of life, and vocal music teaching is no exception. The Intelligent Agent plays a unique role in networked teaching by making up for the lack of intelligence, adaptiveness, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and interoperability and interactivity in all aspects of traditional teaching. This paper introduces the knowledge of Intelligent Agent and then discusses its application in the networked teaching environment. Compared with the traditional teaching environment, the intelligent network teaching environment is more conducive to the initiative and innovation of students, reflecting the characteristics of student-centred learning and achieving a variety of functions such as teaching resource sharing, information interaction, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communication</span>, and distance learning with the support of computer network technology. It is a new field to be explored, especially opening up a new chapter of online vocal music teaching.</p>

<p>In recent years, transportation, medical care, energy, and other fields have relied on a number of smart technologies such as the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things and cloud computing, and the degree of intelligence has continued to increase. As a key part of the future development of cities, education is facing tremendous pressure and challenges. How to use all kinds of smart technologies to promote the informatization of education and create a new era of smarter education is an important mission of current smart education. Decision tree classification is a frequently used technique in data mining. It has the characteristics of fast classification and high efficiency. It is not only used to analyze data but also to make predictions. Professional art education occupies an important position in college education. How to combine decision tree algorithms to develop targeted and effective professional art education and to strengthen the teaching reform and research method innovation of art design has become the current teaching work of colleges and universities. The purpose of this paper is to optimize the teaching mode of art courses in colleges and universities, improve the teaching effect of art classes, and realize the teaching goal of art courses. In this paper, art curriculum teaching experience and the reality of teaching research, through analyzing three local questionnaire surveys of college students, based on the principle of students’ subjectivity from the topic content, organization form, evaluation mode of college art teaching in our student <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, initiative, and the role of creative mechanisms are discussed. According to the practical teaching activities of art courses conducted in this paper, the satisfaction degree of college students with art courses is up to 92%, which indicates that this experiment is still relatively successful and significant, and arouses students’ subjectivity to some extent.</p>

<p>Saudi EFL learners have been traditionally described as non-autonomous. During the coronavirus pandemic, Saudi universities shifted to online education. Scholars maintain that online education by its very nature enhances learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The current study, that was conducted after students received three semesters of online education, aimed to explore the effect of the shift to online education on Saudi college EFL learners’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. It also investigated gender differences in learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Both quantitative data by means of a self-report questionnaire (N=306) and qualitative data by means of a semi-structured online interview (N=20) were collected and analyzed. Quantitative data revealed that Saudi college EFL learners are autonomous (with a total mean of 4.02 out of 5). This mean is much higher than the means obtained in studies conducted before the shift to online education. Females outperformed males in just one dimension of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, autonomous learning enjoyment. No gender differences were found in the other dimensions of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> or total learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Qualitative data analysis indicated that students attributed to online education improvement in five important aspects of their learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, namely, goal setting and organization of study time, the use of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> as learning resources, the use of performance feedback, self-assessment and computer skills. An aspect that witnessed some improvement but still has room for much improvement is reflection on learning.&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Article visualizations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=“/-counters-/edu_01/0926/a.php” alt=“Hit counter” /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>This study is based on the separation of teachers and learners caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the implication of Moore’s Transactional Distance Theory, which proliferated for nearly 30 years but has been inconsistently validated empirically. The quantitative approach was employed, with questionnaires distributed based on the learners’ perspectives. The subjects of the study include 153 respondents from computer science department of an Indonesian public university. Three key tenets of transactional distance include dialogue, structure, and learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> were specifically addressed and validated as significant predictors in this study. The findings elucidated an inverse relationship between dialogue and learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> respectively with transactional distance, and a less rigid course structure capable of contributing to lessen the perceived degree of transactional distance in the e-learning environment. Furthermore, this study discovered that e-learning satisfaction and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> connection speed had an impact on the extent of transactional distance.</p>

<p>This study aimed to ascertain vocational EFL teachers’ perspectives on the development of Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL) resources in vocational schools. It employed a mixed-method approach in which data were collected simultaneously using an open-ended questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. The study involved 95 English teachers from vocational schools in two cities of East Java, Indonesia. Among the participants, four were invited to participate in an online interview to discuss their perspectives on the characteristics, use and development of MALL material for vocational students. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics. The analysis results showed that more than half of the respondents agreed that MALL resources were more accessible (65.4%), easier to generate (65.4%) and more successful at improving learners’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (73.1%), compared to traditional materials. Additionally, 40% of teachers thought that MALL materials could be used to promote classroom interaction, and it was much easier for teachers to provide immediate feedback through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>. In summary, 42% of teachers agreed that MALL resources could aid in foreign language acquisition. Due to students’ proximity to technology and mobile devices, teachers recognized that MALL materials can be applied inside and outside the classrooms. Therefore, vocational EFL teachers must be able to develop and implement MALL materials in their classrooms.</p>

<p>Abstract Introduction: The number of two-to three-year-old children using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s was 10% in 2013 compared to 40% in 2017 (Konok, Bunford, &amp; Miklósi, 2020). Several theoretical and empirical studies deal with the didactics of using modern technology in the classroom. Most studies highlight the neutral (Zsolnai, 2017) or positive impact of using ICT in the classroom. Only a few address the negative effects of digitally enhanced learning (Dávila, Casabayó, &amp; Rayburn, 2018; Livingstone, 2012; Lorenzo &amp; Trujillo, 2018). State education has continually tried to integrate modern technology with education, but there are also examples of institutional restrictions on its use and even a total ban can also be found. Purpose: This study provides an overview of the pedagogical and epistemological reasons why Waldorf pedagogy and Waldorf Steiner schools take a critical approach to the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICT) and to “screens” in general, together with mapping out the current state of Waldorf schools in Hungary. Methods: In the present study, we applied source analysis as a traditional research method in the philosophy of education. Conclusions: The findings show that the institutional use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies entirely contradicts the basis, tasks and spirit of Waldorf pedagogy. If we look at the epistemology and anthroposophical anthropology of Waldorf pedagogy, we can see that the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of a Waldorf teacher is not limitless, and so a continuous practical and theoretical responsibility of the Waldorf movement and Waldorf teachers is to establish and uphold coherence between the practices of every Waldorf institution and Waldorf pedagogy.</p>

<p>Efforts in quality improvement and development of education in the era of regional <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> are not only the responsibility of the central government and provincial governments, but also the responsibility of local governments. Quality improvement and development of education thus become strategic issues for any local government. This study aims to address issues related to: (1) the condition of school facilities and infrastructure (2) the role of school committees which is not optimal; (3) the absence of equitable distribution of teachers; and (4) the lack of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>y/ICT-based learning application in in secondary schools. The research was conducted in four districts, namely Bangkalan, Sampang, Pamekasan and Sumenep. The main theory employed in this study is the School Based Management (SBM) or the so-called School Based Management (SBM). The population was students, parents and teachers. The total number of samples was 250 people comprising 100 students, 100 parents and 50 teachers. The research data were obtained from primary and secondary data. The study yielded a number of key findings. First, 90% of High School (or its equivalent) teachers master the materials taught. This is due to fact that the materials taught are in accordance with the education qualification of the teacher. Secondly, the mismatch found in Madurese high schools was apparently caused by the lack of educators with suitable qualification for the subjects they teach concurrently. Almost all secondary teachers in Madura island require trainings related to the development of competency for mastering the subject materials. The last but not the least, the majority of teachers still apply simple learning methods. Although the method applied by teachers are generally similar, there are significant differences between the favorite schools and the other schools.</p>

<p>The article provides a review of the regulatory documentation framework for the modernization of education in Russia, due to the joining the Bologna process. The directions refected at the level of the federal law on education, national doctrines and projects, federal target programs, letters of the Ministry of Education, and professional standards are considered. The change of the ‘knowledge’ paradigm to the ‘competence’ one is accompanied by the increasing use of digital technologies in all aspects of life, including education. Technological progress has led to computerization, and further informatization of education. The ubiquitous spread of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, directed by the Federal target program «Electronic Russia» (2002-2010) and the National project «Education», should have expanded the boundaries through the implementation of e-learning and distance learning technologies, promote democratization and accessibility of education, make the educational space more open. However, the monitoring has revealed problems with the overall strategy of e-education, the availability of the learning environment, and the availability of educational and methodological support. One of the possible ways to solve the problem is to appeal to open education and the implementation of massive open online courses, which are now designed by the leading Russian universities. A change of requirements for the participants of the educational process, an increase in students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, a tendency of forming an individual learning path, the use of project and group techniques based on digital technologies are seen. These measures should contribute to the competitiveness of the Russian higher education in the world.</p>

<p>In the third-year microprocessors course given to Me<span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>ronics Engineering students at the University of Waterloo, the lab studies have been redesigned as a scaffolded project. The project aims to provide a more authentic learning opportunity that integrates concepts from the concurrent courses, as well as prior courses. The project was carefully designed to provide some student <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> while ensuring competence can be achieved by students with a broad range of initial skill levels through the completion of authentic tasks. The impacts of the revised project on student learning were measured using pre- and postproject surveys, course grades and course critiques. Despite significant challenges that were encountered during the first two offerings, the results show that students perceived an increased competence in several key skills, and an increase was seen in overall course satisfaction.

<p>This article addresses the teaching carried out by teachers in the state of Paraíba during the Covid-19 pandemic and aims to reflect on the impacts of Emergency Remote Education (ERE) on their pedagogical practices. It is a case study whose data were collected through a questionnaire prepared in Google Forms, which was applied through a link to one hundred and five teachers of different subjects who work in municipal, state or federal public and private schools, in high school and / or in the final years of elementary school. The collected data were analyzed in the light of a literature that explores the ERE and its implementation. The results obtained showed a diversity of practices carried out by means of Digital <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies (DICT), part of which is in line with the modus operandi of traditional education and part of which seeks to overcome it. Taken together, these practices can provide students with more <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, new forms of communication between educational actors and the acquisition of new learning about the pedagogical use of DICT with the potential to modify the teaching that succeeds the pandemic, when we return to the “new normal” of classroom teaching</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic, which struck the world in 2020, has hit education systems around the world. The world community has begun searching for and testing models for organising the educational process in a new reality. The purpose of this study was to analyse how the education system in Ukraine is functioning under the COVID-19 pandemic. The theoretical framework for considering the research problem is based on the theory of synergetics. Such synergetic postulates as openness, evolution, dynamics, bifurcation point, interaction, self-organisation, irreversibility and new state are key guidelines for understanding the processes taking place in Ukrainian education. A qualitative research approach was used to guide the study. The research methods included the review of the governmental documents, review of the surveys and interviews. The major finding is that the COVID-19 pandemic is transforming the education system in Ukraine and many changes are positive. This includes the long-awaited <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of educational institutions, the opportunity to acquire digital skills by educators, strengthening cooperation with regional and local authorities and updates to the overloaded curriculum. The Ukrainian authorities, the pedagogical community and society are working together to organise education under new conditions. However, Ukrainian education faces serious challenges (partly inadequate <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> access in homes, especially in rural areas; lack of educators’ online instruction skills; few official methodological guidelines and online textbooks and low levels of motivation of students to participate in online sessions). The findings thus revealed the importance of a national strategy for the development of education, considering the recommendations of the international organisations and the experience of foreign countries.</p>

<p>This study aims to investigate how Turkish students’ involvement in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICT) predicts their math and science performance in the 2018 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) test. The research also tests demographic variables including socioeconomic status (SES) and gender as covariates. The data were examined through two-step hierarchical regression analyses. Regarding demographics, SES revealed a significant positive contribution to the prediction of math and science performance, whereas gender failed to make a significant contribution. Additionally, after controlling demographics, ICT availability at home significantly and negatively predicted student math and science performance, whilst ICT availability at school was not found to be significantly contributory. Regarding ICT use variables, all constructs significantly predicted student math and science performances, but some negatively contributed to the model, whereas others positively contributed. Amongst ICT attitude variables, all constructs made a significantly positive or negative contribution to predicting both math and science performance, with one exception. Only perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in ICT use failed to significantly contribute to the prediction of math performance. Based on the findings, it was concluded that persistent involvement in ICT tends to be related to decreased math and science performance. We propose that policymakers and practitioners drop the myth that ICT use results in better achievement under any circumstances and should therefore refrain from integrating ICT without first undertaking careful planning.</p>

<p>&lt;p style=“text-align: justify;”&gt;A professional development that is often mandated is exclusionary, less motivating, and provides teachers with little or no improvement in their professional practice as well as student achievement. This necessitates a fundamental change in policy from prescribing professional development to addressing teachers’ self-identified felt needs. Hitherto, teachers are generally disenfranchised from specifying their felt needs for development, thus they feel uninterested, or enthusiastic to attend professional development programs that are prescribed for them by school leaders. When they do or are compelled to attend, they tend to be less attentive and are often indulged in reading newspapers, grading students’ test papers, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">texting</span>, playing video games, or simply doing something unrelated to the professional development. This practice stifles teachers’ professional growth and student learning, hence it must not be allowed to continue unabated. Through a qualitative case study research design, using survey, interviews, and focus groups, this research brought to the fore, the debilitating effects of the current practice. Analysis of data yielded four major themes: choice, motivation, effectiveness, and satisfaction. The study proposed a paradigm shift in policy from mandating to granting teachers the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to identify their own real or felt needs for professional development. Implications for practice, leadership, policy, and further research were also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic led, in Portugal as well in other countries, to an abrupt transition to online classes in higher education, with no consideration for the specific students’ conditions. Therefore, this study aims to assess the students’ perspective on online learning classes carried out during the lockdown in 2020. The analysis is based on 2,107 valid answers from students of seven Portuguese higher education institutions that took synchronous online classes. Principal component analysis and binary logistic regression were the main quantitative methods used. This study identified five factors that, in all cases, significantly explain the students’ perspective on the transition to online classes. These factors include not only pedagogical matters (teachers’ overall quality) but also elements related to personal or motivational students’ characteristics (performance and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>; constraints and obstacles to socialization; self-confidence while attending online classes) and technological issues (<span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> access conditions). Notwithstanding, self-confidence is not a relevant factor for students that had technical limitations in what concerns infrastructural matters. Therefore, besides confirming the factors behind the success of online classes, this research is relevant for highlighting the need to assure that students have the proper conditions regarding technical infrastructures to improve the overall quality of online classes. Keywords: COVID-19, emergency remote teaching, higher education, technical infrastructures, students’ perspective.</p>

<p>The aim of this study is to describe the experience of Higher Education Institution (HEI) faculty members on transactional distance in the context of a flexible educational landscape during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data gathered from eight (8) participants who have been teaching in a state college since the start of the pandemic. A common meaning of distance emerged from the analysis and was revealed through three different aspects wherein the variables of the Transactional Distance Theory (TDT) are concerned predominantly: i. dialogue (difficulty in communication and interaction), ii. structure (issues on participation due to intermittent <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> connectivity), and iii. learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (poor performance in assessment results). These variables in TDT prompted the exemplification of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>gogy and heutagogy in a flexible educational landscape from the descriptions of teachers. Responding to the sense of distance, teaching reflected upon the opportunity in sharing current practice to foster flexibility while employing a learning management system to accommodate learner needs. The findings were discussed and interpreted as an embodied experience originating from the passage of transactional distance continually affecting faculty members’ life fundamental transition to a changed pedagogical space that is reflected in their experience of teaching amidst the constraints brought by the pandemic.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> has penetrated into people’s lives as the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> education platform has faced many changes in the way vocal music is taught in the new situation. The teaching methods set up on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> have also undergone dramatic changes. A number of advanced music education concepts have emerged that require a careful review of the current state of music education in the world and in China. Current online learning environments are usually used only for formal or informal learning. The former overemphasizes the subjective role of the teacher and ignores the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the learner. Through a new modern network education method, this paper deeply analyzes the unique advantages and existing problems of a new voice education method based on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and puts forward corresponding solutions. Its purpose is to encourage more ordinary vocal music teachers to better understand the new teaching methods, broaden their artistic horizons, consciously use modern teaching methods to support vocal music education in ordinary schools, and further expand the scope of music application. The experimental results show that for 4000 concurrent users, the response time of the system is less than 5 seconds, which can meet the time requirements of the system. For the service of querying some other data, the response time of the system is less than 9 seconds, so the response ability of the system to multiple users is impressive. Therefore, with the development of education, comprehensive network education platform is also the development direction of informatization in the future.</p>

The study is designed as a systematic review. ITE-related 67 documents published by UN, EU, and OECD were analyzed following several coding steps. According to the results, international institutions promote entrepreneurship, life-long learning, and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies as economic issues in ITE. As political issues, they put forward social themes including preparing for diversity, quality in ITE including accountability and standards, and structure of ITE including flexibility and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Although the documents are mainly parallel with the consensus approach, economic and political issues revealed in the study were discussed from perspectives of both approaches. One perspective considers promoting the economic issues in ITE the economic efficiency and growth which is beneficial for all. The other reminds that division of this benefit may include class-based inequalities. Also, different perspectives emphasize different social themes and they bring different explanations for how the quality assurance functions.</p>

<p>Pedagogical conditions that ensure the organization of the educational process in higher educational institutions with specific studying conditions in terms of martial law based on the right to <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of higher educational institution and legal regulation of its activities are presented in the article. The purpose of the article is to determine the pedagogical conditions for the organization of the educational process in higher educational institution with specific studying conditions in terms of martial law throughout Ukraine. Methodology of the article. Consideration of the peculiarities of the organization of the educational process in higher educational institutions with specific studying conditions. It is revealed that in terms of martial law, there is a need to introduce pedagogical conditions to address issues related to: limiting opportunities for the use of information and communicative technologies in the educational process while the absence of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and mobile communications; ensuring timely completion of course and qualification papers by all applicants for higher education; conducting group classes that provide for the circulation of language information with limited access; involving scientific and pedagogical workers and cadets in scientific work. It is highlighted that the normative legal acts regulating the educational process provide general recommendations for ensuring two-way communication between the subjects of the educational process in a higher educational institution. The effectiveness of the introduction of pedagogical conditions related to the organization of the educational process in terms of martial law has been demonstrated, on the example of the Academy of the State Penitentiary Service. The educational process is represented through a system of scientific and methodological and pedagogical measures that have proven their worth in terms of martial law. Results. The analysis of normative legal acts regulating the activity of higher educational institutions contributed to the highlighting of the peculiarities of the organization of the educational process in the terms of martial law. It is proved that in terms of martial law the organization of the educational process is significantly influenced by factors caused by difficulties in using informative and communicative technologies for group classes, setting educational tasks that require additional sources in a special library, ensuring academic integrity, effective development of general and special (professional) competencies. Practical significance of the obtained results is that they contribute to choosing the pedagogical conditions that promote the organization of the educational process in higher educational institutions with specific studying conditions in terms martial law. Key words: <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of higher educational institution, pedagogical conditions, individual schedule, informative and communicative technologies, academic disciplines.</p>

<p>Self-regulated learning is a method of the student-centered learning paradigm. This method encourages students to be actively involved in the learning process, organize themselves, recognize their capabilities, and take the initiative to decide the appropriate way to achieve the learning achievement. The use of self-regulated learning with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s’ assistance has had a double effect on students’ language proficiency. However, the self-regulated learning method with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> assistance in the speaking class has not been supported by current empirical studies. The evidence indicates that self-regulated learning with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s’ assistance affects students’ English skills, such as acuity in micro-and macro-linguistics analysis, improved digital literacy, enthusiasm for learning, and self-potential development <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. This study aimed to analyze the impact of using the self-regulated learning method with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s in the speaking class. This review is a quantitative study with a pre-test and post-test design that was executed between October 2020 until January 2021. 110 students were chosen as samples in this study. An English-speaking rubric has been used to obtain data; that data was then analyzed by a software application that is SPSS 24.0, which was proceeded by qualitative description. The findings demonstrate that using a self-regulated learning method with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> assistance has positively impacted student speaking ability. This increased effect is demonstrated by the adjusted mean score on the post-test = 82.32. English instructors are encouraged to apply this method by considering students’ characteristics, cognitive capacities, learning styles, learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and the steps of how to apply this method in the instruction process.</p>

<p>Objective. The objective of this study is to know the integration process of Digital Technologies of Information and Communication (DTIC), facilities and limits perceived by professors of an undergraduate course in Nursing. Methods. Descriptive and exploratory study, with a qualitative approach, carried out in 2018, with nine professors from an undergraduate Nursing course at a public university located in the interior of Ceará. For the data production process, semi-structured interviews were conducted and content analysis was carried out. Results. DTIC have been integrated into teaching practices from different perspectives, in theoretical and practical activities, using mobile practice simulation applications, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networks, links to website</span>s, WhatsApp® groups and video-lessons. Furthermore, the integration of these technologies increases the creation of strategies that promote the active participation of the student, offering spaces for reflection, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, as well as the development of creativity and collaboration. Teachers highlight interactivity and communication, access to resources that are not available at the University, such as anatomical models, simulators of nursing procedures. Among the limits, structural issues, access to the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>, absence of institutional policies and permanent education are factors that demand greater attention for an effective pedagogical integration of DTIC. Conclusion. Although it represents an initial process of use, there is a potential for continuity and expansion of DTIC in different environments and disciplines. Efforts have been undertaken by teachers to integrate these technologies into the context of pedagogical activities in the Nursing course.</p>

<p>Background and Purpose: English for Specific Purposes (ESP) instruction in Iran is still mostly focused on traditional ways. This study aims to investigate ESP teachers’ and students’ perceptions of integrating <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>y (ICT) in ESP instruction to solve traditional ESP instruction problems in Iran.
 
 Methodology: This concurrent parallel mixed method study investigated students’ and teachers’ perceptions of solving ESP instruction problems through ICT. The sample concluded 300 undergraduate engineering students and 24 experienced and novice ESP teachers. In the quantitative phase of the study, data were collected through two adapted questionnaires. In the qualitative phase, data were obtained from interviews with 12 undergraduate students, three experienced, and three novice ESP teachers.
 
 Findings: The findings revealed that the participants had positive perceptions of integrating different ICT tools for solving the problems with traditional ESP materials and methods, problems with low language skills, lack of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, demotivation problem, inactivity problem, and problems with lack of exposure to real-life situations. The findings also showed that integrating different ICT tools and ICT-based interactive activities promote students’ communication skills subconsciously through experiencing direct participation in communications.
 
 Conclusion and Contributions:he findings might contribute significantly to change the ESP instruction status quo in Iran, which is not based on the ESP students’ communication needs, and replace it with innovative approaches to meet the needs of the modern ESP student. The results also provide a unique outlook of promoting ESP instruction in tertiary education by integrating ICTs through divergent stakeholder perceptions.

<p>Online higher education teaching and learning has become a new normal in many countries due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, the support for online learning seems inadequate to address students’ diverse online learning needs and may impede the inclusiveness in higher education. Therefore, based on a questionnaire administered to higher education students in Sri Lanka, this paper examines the support or lack of support students have experienced during the university closure that may enable or hinder inclusive online learning. It draws on Self-Determination Theory (SDT) as a theoretical lens to analyse and make sense of these enablers for and barriers to inclusive online higher education. The key findings suggest that students first need <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support to access stable and affordable <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and devices, and quality online learning resources. They also need competence support for monitoring and managing their own learning through feedback and scaffolding as they engage in their learning online. Finally, they need relatedness support for reducing their anxiety and having a sense of connectedness by interacting and communicating with teachers and students.</p>

<p>Physical Education is rooted in physical movement and exploration and is usually held outdoors to make teaching and learning more accessible and meaningful. Since the pandemic happened, schools adopt a new teaching-learning modality which create new host of obstacles for Physical Education teachers, especially in teaching practical skills in Physical Education to the students due to its characteristics. This becomes now challenging to monitor students’ progress in performing the skills or whether students have acquired/performed the skills correctly. This study aims to explore the strategies and techniques in the teaching of practical skills in Physical Education in the new normal. This study also identifies the effectiveness and hindrances of the strategies and techniques used. The findings of this study serve as a basis in formulating a framework for enriching contemporary curriculum discourse in physical education of senior high public schools in Tagbilaran City during the school year 2020-2021. Physical Education teachers used a variety of ways in the new normal to effectively teach practical skills in Physical Education, rather than depending solely on printed modular instruction. In teaching the practical skills, task teaching and students submitting video performances were employed. Because of the nature of modular distance learning, students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for learning is one of the contributing elements to the difficulty of teaching practical skills in physical education. Many students have not yet established sufficient learning <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, resulting in learning gaps and preventing them from developing practical skills in physical education. Adding to that is the lack of needed resources such as gadgets and poor <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> connections.</p>

<p>Abstract. Introduction. The school breakdown in spring 2020 made both teachers and learners all overthe world face new challenges: how to cope with distance learning (DL). It was not simple even in the welldeveloped countries. In Ukraine teachers tried to find different solutions. This period was a sudden but hugestep towards implementing ICT into the learning process. Purpose. The aim of the present study was to get aninsight into the way learners see distance learning, to hear their opinion and see their attidude to this form ofeducation, the difficulties and challenges they encountered during this period in the learning process in generaland in foreign language (FL) learning in particular. The focus was made on the learning habits, motivation,assessment, applications used, time spent on learning and stress students might have experienced. Methods.An online questionnaire containing closed-ended and open-ended questions was compiled and filled in bylearners of the upper grades of different schools. The data analysis was interpretive and statistical. Results.The material was sent mainly in the form of written text or video links and recordings via Messenger, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>or Google Classroom, very few online lessons were held. Most learners had difficulties; the most problematicarea in FL learning was grammar. Feedback and assessment were mainly in written form. The attitude tolearning was quite serious, learners developed their digital skills but some became demotivated. It was moretime-consuming, more difficult but less stressful and also less effective than face-to-face learning. Conclusion.Despite all the difficulties faced learners developed learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, digital skills and gained experience ina new form of learning that can be useful for them in their future studies as in the digital age DL is gainingground worldwide.</p>

<p>The advent of computer in general and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> in particular has opened new avenues for learning language. Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) is considered highly effective for language learning as technology creates a student centered environment, increases learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and results in higher learning outcomes. This study investigated if CALL using Web Based Instruction (WBI) as a tool is more beneficial than the traditional method for teaching English grammar to undergraduate students in Pakistan. An experimental design was followed to compare the effect of technology based and traditional method of teaching and a focus group interview was conducted to obtain the participants’ views about CALL. MANCOVA test was applied for the analysis of the pretest and posttest scores. Results showed that the experimental group performed significantly better than the control group. Additionally, the students exhibited a positive attitude towards technology based teaching. Based on these findings, integration of computers is recommended in English language teaching for improved learning.</p>

<p>Blended learning has taken center stage in higher education because it involves overseeing of “Online learning” and the ongoing growth of teaching reform in colleges and universities. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> promotes the reconfiguration and integration of educational resources. The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> has greatly magnified the role and value of high-quality educational resources. Blended teaching combines the advantages of traditional teaching and network teaching to complement each other; it not only gives full play to the flexibility and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of network teaching, but also retains the connection of teacher-student emotional communication in traditional teaching. Translation teaching is an important part of college English teaching. This article mainly introduces the research of college English translation (CET) blended teaching strategies under the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> background. This paper proposes a research plan for CET blended teaching strategies under the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> background, including literature research method, questionnaire survey method, analytic hierarchy process, expert interview method, teaching evaluation sentiment classification algorithm based on feature-weighted Stacking algorithm, and analytic hierarchy process of the teaching effect evaluation algorithm. The experimental results of this article show that the average value of the questionnaire Cronbach’s α coefficient is 0.915, demonstrating that the study’s information is both extremely plausible and reasonably real.</p>

<p>This article addresses discourses on Active Methodologies (AMs) in mother tongue teaching materials, with the aim of problematizing them. AMs bring strategies that promise a more dynamic class, with active participation of the student, placing them at the center of the learning process, which leads to more <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and responsibility. Theoretical contributions are from Discourse Analysis (DA), based on Foucault (1999), for the analysis of the meaning effects, emanating from the discourse. In the school context, the textbook acts as a form of power-knowledge, imposing regimes of truth. An analysis was made in a high school textbook of a public school, and a subtle use of AMs was observed. They appear as a hoax for traditional teaching, masquerading as liberating, fun and playful teaching. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies (ICT) are placed as if they were easily accessible and familiar to students.</p>

<p>The use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s among secondary school students is of concern when looking at the increase of violent behaviors in schools. The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> use and the psychological wellbeing of secondary school students has become an issue of interest for research. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between the time spent on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> use and the psychological wellbeing of secondary school students in Nairobi County, Kenya. The study used an embedded mixed method research design. A Multistage sampling method was employed in selecting the 7 schools, and the sample size of 357 respondents. Data was collected using a questionnaire and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Pearson’s Product Moment Correlation Coefficients was used for data analysis. The main findings of this study showed a strong positive correlation between time spent on the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s and the psychological wellbeing of secondary school students (0.885). The study also found out that there was a strong positive correlation between time spent on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s and the aspect of personal growth (0.985) and the self-acceptance (0.980). There was a moderate positive correlation between time spent on the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s and the environmental mastery (0.60), the purpose in life (0.528) and the positive relations with others (0.457). There was a weak positive correlation between time spent on the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s and the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (0.004). The study recommends that the school administration should establish counselling facilities which can address the issues related to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s use among secondary school students.</p>

<p>The article elaborates on an interactive approach to language learning applied in an online EFL classroom. It presents a new insight into implementing interactive methods to develop students’ communicative competence. In conditions of world integration, the formation of communicative and life skills is indispensable. Eventually, such an approach to English language learning in distance mode is the most accessible way for teacher-learner(s) interaction to acquire general linguistic expertise and upgrade specific language skills.
 The study results show that an interactive approach facilitates live communication in online EFL settings, enhances learners’ motivation and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and fosters quick decision-making reactions. Modern computer technologies offer boundless opportunities for interactive methods application in the online foreign language learning context. A skillful instructor is called to masterly plan <span style="background-color:lightgreen">computer-mediated</span> classroom activities, creating space to realize each student’s cognitive and communicative potential fully. Students learn to debate, substantiate their viewpoints, brainstorm ideas, do projects, work individually or collaborate in comfortable learning settings.</p>

<p>Changes in the education system require a person to have a creative attitude to activity, mobility, responsibility, and new technologies. To form the creativity of students, it is necessary to use innovative technologies and the peculiarities of the digital environment. The author identifies the pedagogical conditions for the formation of students’ creativity. The theoretical and empirical methods used are the analysis of key concepts, observation, a survey and the analysis of students’ outcomes. The key concepts of creativity are clarified: “creativity” and the “ability to be creative”. The essential characteristics of creativity are revealed. The pedagogical conditions to form students’ creativity are revealed. They are: to include problem-solving tasks and pedagogical situations; to use reflection; to apply innovative pedagogical technologies. The creative technologies that contribute to the formation of students’ creativity are identified. The most effective technologies that contribute to the development of students’ creative abilities are <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies, project work, gamification, module learning, and group technologies. The common features of these technologies are cooperation, student’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and reflexive activity. The identified effective technologies and creative tasks offered can be used by the academic staff that implement Bachelor’s and Master’s education programs.</p>

<p>Instructors commonly assume that the successful online course must replicate its live counterpart by including a variety of interactions among student, instructor, and computer. Given the changing lifestyles prompted by an evolving <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, an increasing student need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and student learning styles, highly interactive courses may not necessarily be the best online approach. In this article, I review research dealing with interactive environments, present the results of my own interaction study, and propose an integrative approach for the use of interaction that sees it in light of the increasing integration of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> into students’ daily lives.</p>

<p>Purpose – This paper is part of a larger study which explored postgraduate students talk around academic texts via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> (FB). Our exploration is largely guided by the idea of reading as a social practice. In this paper, we specifically focus on the students’ reflections of their online experience of talking around academic texts. Method – The qualitative data used in this paper were derived from students’ reflective diaries, students’ FB interactions, and informal conversations and were collected from a group of students (27) attending a master’s class in distance learning mode.Thematic analysis was conducted to examine the themes that emerged to represent their reflections.Findings – The students’ reflections were grouped into two major categories: convenience and facilitation of learning.Students’ reflection on the convenience afforded by the FB talk centered mainly on the idea of distance and time. Their reflections on the facilitation of learning were broken down into the following themes: safe environment to explore, social support, self-regulation and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.A separate category, “FB entries need responding”, was assigned to students’ comments about the importance of lecturer’s and group members’ feedback.Value – This study revealed the potential of FB as a convenient, safe and an informal avenue for students to share their understandings and reading-related problems.The informal nature of their FB experience supported free exploration of ideas without the worry of having to appear “clever”.</p>

<p>Within the framework of the Information Society, we carried out a developmental research2 that focuses on the process of conception, implementation and evaluation of a virtual learning environment model (prototype of an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> device) aimed at university teaching. The course that serves the modelization is Educational Technology in the context of initial teacher training. One of the purposes of the research was to understand the overall process concerning the design of the environment and validate it for further development. Another aim was to discuss a pedagogical issue that is related to questions such as: From a pedagogical perspective, what is the gain in introducing web technologies at university presential teaching? Can the flexibilization allowed by these technologies potentiate learners’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and, thus, enable the acquisition of skills that are necessary for them to learn throughout their lives? What happens when a system like this is used? In the text we present the study and emphasize the methodology adopted due to the fact that it is new in the Portuguese context. Key words: developmental research, e-learning, university pedagogy.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTIONHow might middle school teachers and schools more appropriately engage early adolescent students in the writing process so that they are motivated and engaged to want to write and write well? We know that education for young adolescents must be developmentally responsive, challenging, empowering, and equitable. There is also a need for strong, authentic relationships among and between the student, curriculum, community, teacher, and school. As well, the curriculum must engage students in active, purposeful learning. These essential attributes connect to the literature on student engagement and highlight a unique approach to writing that has been implemented in Philadelphia area schools over the past 10 years.The purpose of this article is to introduce Writers Matter, an approach designed to engage and motivate young adolescents in the writing process, connect this approach to the student engagement literature and provide research results from a pre-post writing survey that focuses on student engagement. Writers Matter supports literacy, equity, and excellence in middle grades through its focus on <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, voice, and relationship building in the context of writing tasks that connect to personal experience and other content areas (Yost «fe Vogel, 2012).RELATED RESEARCH ON STUDENT ENG A GEMENTAdolescents write all the time, through text messages, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span>, and blogs. Why is it that so many adolescents are less motivated to complete writing tasks required in school? The literature on student engagement may provide the reader with some answers, since it is well known that engaged students are more successful in school (Fredricks, Blumenfeld, «fe Paris, 2004; Martin «fe Dowson, 2009; Osterman, 2000; Wang The school engagement literature seeks to discover ways to create environments that stimulate greater learning. According to Fredricks et al.&nbsp;(2004), many adolescents view school as boring or a grade game, in which students try to get by with as little effort as pos* sible (p.&nbsp;60). Further, these authors state that recent studies have shown steep declines in school motivation among adolescents. The literature defines engagement in three ways (Fredricks et al., 2004):* Behavioral engagement includes involvement in academic or social/extracurricular activities.* Cognitive engagement centers on students’ motivation or drive to persist on academic tasks, thus developing and using self-regulation strategies in order to succeed.* Emotional engagement focuses on adolescents’ positive or negative reactions to teachers, classmates, academics, and the school.All contribute in different ways to increased academic learning and achievement.Cognitive EngagementCognitive engagement comprises a willingness on the part of students to expend the necessary effort to master difficult skills using strategies that support learning. Studies have found that students are strategic about their learning in settings that are socially supportive, respectful, challenging and autonomous (Fredricks et al., 2004). Cognitive engagement occurs when class members actively debate and discuss ideas, and engage in a critique of others’ work in an environment that is mutually respectful. A key concept in this research is that cognitive engagement occurs more readily in supportive, caring learning environments.Peterson and Hittie (2003) identify several attributes of a supportive learning community:* belonging (feeling a valued member of a group);* inclusion (membership in the group is open and diversity is valued);* support and care (group members receive support, mentoring, assistance, and caring they need in order to develop coping strategies; all members of the group help each other to achieve, which is a community goal);* contributions and responsibility (all members have an obligation to contribute to the common good); and* democratic problem solving (conflicts are managed by inclusive dialogue and democratic decision making; listening, understanding, and perspective taking are crucial prerequisites). …</p>
