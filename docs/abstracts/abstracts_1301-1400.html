<p>There is a severe tendency in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>law theory to delegitimize state intervention in the governance of virtual communities. Much of the existing theory makes one of two fundamental flawed assumptions: that communities will always be best governed without the intervention of the state; or that the territorial state can best encourage the development of communities by creating enforceable property rights and allowing the market to resolve any disputes. These assumptions do not ascribe sufficient weight to the value-laden support that the territorial state always provides to private governance regimes, the inefficiencies that will tend to limit the development utopian communities, and the continued role of the territorial state in limiting <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in accordance with communal values. In order to overcome these deterministic assumptions, this article provides a framework based upon the values of the rule of law through which to conceptualise the legitimacy of the private exercise of power in virtual communities. The rule of law provides a constitutional discourse that assists in considering appropriate limits on the exercise of private power. I argue that the private contractual framework that is used to govern relations in virtual communities ought to be informed by the values of the rule of law in order to more appropriately address the governance tensions that permeate these spaces. These values suggest three main limits to the exercise of private power: that governance is limited by community rules and that the scope of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is limited by the substantive values of the territorial state; that private contractual rules should be general, equal, and certain; and that, most importantly, internal norms be predicated upon the consent of participants.</p>

<p>A “Democracy Index” is published annually by the Economist. For 2017, it reported that half of the world’s countries scored lower than the previous year. This included the United States, which was demoted from “full democracy” to “flawed democracy.” The principal factor was “ero-sion of confidence in government and public institutions.” Interference by Russia and voter manipulation by Cambridge Analytica in the 2016 presi-dential election played a large part in that public disaffection.</p>
<p>Threats of these kinds will continue, fueled by growing deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) tools to manipulate the preconditions and levers of democracy. Equally destructive is AI’s threat to decisional and informa-tional privacy. AI is the engine behind Big Data Analytics and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things. While conferring some consumer benefit, their principal function at present is to capture personal information, create detailed behavioral profiles and sell us goods and agendas. Privacy, anonymity and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> are the main casualties of AI’s ability to manipulate choices in economic and political decisions.</p>
<p>The way forward requires greater attention to these risks at the nation-al level, and attendant regulation. In its absence, technology giants, all of whom are heavily investing in and profiting from AI, will dominate not only the public discourse, but also the future of our core values and democratic institutions.</p>

<p>E-government as part of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> products has become a topic of discussion in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and mass media discussions and is popular after being linked to the regional <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> policy of districts / cities in Indonesia. However, there are still many government information systems that are developed and implemented that do not function optimally at both the regional and central government levels. Measuring the level of E-government maturity is needed to determine the extent to which the successful application of E-government is. The purpose of the E-government maturity assessment is to provide basic data, advanced data, and all that is necessary for the development of an E-government strategy. Gartner is one of the models used to measure the maturity level of e-government. Gartner’s model suggests four critical phases of the evolution of e-government, namely: web presence, interaction, transactions, and transformation. The gartner model is used to measure the maturity level in Sukoharjo district. The research methodology used a questionnaire and the calculation used the average score for each dimension. To determine the relationship between dimensions and criteria, the PLS (Partial Least Square) method is used. Research has proven that the maturity level of E-government is 4.06 (predictable process). The dimensions of transformation and usability affect community participation using e-government in Sukoharjo district.</p>

<p>Working life has digitalized considerably in recent decades and organizations have taken into use new forms of collaborative technologies such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms. This study examined the relationship between <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use at work and well-being at work for millennials and members of former generations in Finland. The research data contained focus group interviews (N = 52), an expert organization survey (N = 563), and a nationally representative survey (N = 1817). Well-being measures included technostress, burnout, psychological distress, and a set of background variables. Content analysis and linear regression models were used as analysis methods. The results showed that millennials have various intrinsic and extrinsic motivations for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use at work. Intrinsic motivations included employees’ personal choice and their pure interest to follow the market and discussions in their own field. Extrinsic motivations were related mainly to organizations’ work culture and personal branding. The survey findings revealed, however, that millennials were not only more active <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> users for work, but they also experienced higher technostress and burnout than members of former generations. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social media</span> use motivations were associated with both higher and lower technostress and burnout depending on motivation, indicating that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use can have both positive and negative effects. Overall, our findings suggest that employees tend to utilize <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> more if their needs for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness are fulfilled.</p>

<p>AbstractThe Law Merchant is depicted today as a transnational system based on merchant practice operating outside the fabric of national law. It is conceived as cosmopolitan in nature, universal in application, expertly delivered, and independent of other regulatory systems.This article critiques these qualities attributed to the historical as well as present-day Law Merchant. It disputes that it has evolved ‘spontaneously’ out of merchant practice; that it is uniform in nature; and that it transcends national law. It argues instead that the Law Merchant is often fragmentary in nature and subject to disparate national and transnational influences. It challenges, in particular, unitary conceptions of ‘<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>’ ascribed to the Law Merchant, presenting a pluralistic conception of Law Merchant ‘<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>’ instead. It illustrates these arguments in relation to the so-called <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span>space Law Merchant and to transnational commercial arbitration.</p>

<p>Consent has enjoyed a prominent position in the American privacy system since at least 1970, though historically, consent emerged from traditional notions of tort and contract. Largely because consent has an almost deferential power as a proxy for consumer choice, organizations increasingly use consent as a de facto standard for demonstrating privacy commitments. The Department of Health and Human Services and the Federal Trade Commission have integrated the concept of consent into health care, research, and general commercial activities. Despite consent’s prominence in U.S. law, this article seeks to understand, more fully, consent’s origins and development, then applies a philosophical-legal lens to clearly identify problems with consent in its current use. Jurgen Habermas’ theory of communicative action as it applies to private and public spheres and Helen Nissenbaum’s model for contextual inquiry provide useful lenses for understanding the impact of consent on human <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. This article suggests five resulting problems for human <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, the “consent myth,” and four principles for addressing these problems in contemporary health technologies, such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Health Things (IoHT) and artificial intelligence (AI) applications.</p>

<p>Three philosophical rationales–search-for-truth, self-governance, and self-fulfillment–have animated discussions of free expression for decades. Each rationale emerged and attained prominence in American jurisprudence in specific political and cultural circumstances. Moreover, each rationale shares a foundational commitment to the classical liberal (modernist) self. But the three traditional rationales are incompatible with our digital age. In particular, the idea of the classical liberal self enjoying maximum liberty in a private sphere does not fit in the postmodern information society. The time for a new rationale has arrived. The same sociocultural conditions that undermine the traditional rationales suggest a self-emergence rationale built on the feminist concept of relational <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. This novel rationale constitutionally protects expression that fosters the ongoing creative and dynamic process of self-emergence. As such, the rationale justifies protecting expression concerned with the emergent self’s struggle to define itself and the broader culture. The self-emergence rationale has important ramifications, especially for free-expression issues related to the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. The Roberts Court has invoked the traditional rationales in granting expansive first-amendment protections to corporations. Many <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>-related issues involve multinational corporations, such as Google, Verizon, and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>. But under the self-emergence rationale, publicly held business corporations should not have free-speech rights for two reasons. First, they have fixed rather than emergent natures. Second, they manipulate and limit the sociocultural space available for the autonomous self-emergence of individuals.</p>

<p>Present U.S. privacy law is predominantly based on the ideals of individual control, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and liberty from governmental intrusion, despite the fact that its inspiration was an idea grounded on the importance of protecting human dignity and an “inviolate personality.” On the other hand, Europe has predominantly taken the position that privacy protects human dignity and fosters personal relationships. This view also promotes individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, although it does so in a different fashion and – as this paper suggests – perhaps to a greater extent. Privacy laws based on the right to a private life, such as those generally found in European jurisdictions, more accurately reflect the realities of the digital age and properly protect individual privacy online. In combination, protecting <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> through principles based on human dignity and recognizing that reasonable expectations can have their place in the context of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>ies and digital communication – albeit often mediated and less private than some forms of offline communication – would result in more effective individual safeguards and more satisfactory results. Recent decisions of the European Court of Human Rights have laid the theoretical groundwork required for heightened protection of human dignity in these online environments.</p>

<p>Virtual spaces to help learn a language or write autonomously have become common and are only likely to increase. Multiple resources can be placed on a site easily accessible 24/7 and computer mediated communication in various forms can supply needed human interaction spaces. But how are these sites used by the local students? Following the path of several individuals in detail can allow more understanding and depth of the precise usage of space. This paper tracks two Arab students exploring and using a newly formed online self-access centre (SAC) for writing or online writing lab (OWL) for the best part of a semester. As an exploratory action research study, it was data driven and multiple data sources were mainly unobtrusive so that the study could proceed very naturally. The choices, learning style, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> types and personality differences between the two students suggest a range of support is ideal in an online SAC to cater for individuals in this context, including resources, how to learn, 1-1 asynchronous with advisor (<span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s), forums, electronic writing raters, and a high profile test. Ongoing action research should help to keep the online facility relevant to needs and open to new ways.</p>

<p>Contractual choice of Law in contracts of adhesion is an issue that poses great challenge to the conflict of law theory. The issue is also practically important because the increasing use of form contracts in the traditional paper world, and particularly in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> based business transactions. In the US, the enforceability of contracts of adhesion remains unsettled and the choice of law question in the contracts as such is left unanswered. The article analyzes the nature of contracts of adhesion as opposed to the party <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> principle in contractual choice of law, and argues that contracts of adhesion do not conform to the basic notion of party <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The article suggests that the choice of law clause in contracts of adhesion shall not take effect unless adherents meaningfully agree. The article proposes a second chance approach for contractual choice of law in contracts of adhesion. The approach is intended to set a general rule that a choice of law clause in an adhesive contract shall not be deemed enforceable prior to affirmation of the true assent of adherent.</p>

<p>This essay explores why the United States is relinquishing an important source of power over the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, and what this means for both users of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and scholars of global governance. The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> began as a niche tool of engineers and academics, funded by the Department of Defense. Governance was loosely exercised by an insular group of enthusiasts and experts. By the 1990s, as the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> grew rapidly, control was asserted more directly by the US government. Significant power was delegated to the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), a California non-profit. In June 2016, the Obama administration approved ICANN’s proposal for independent management of the critical “naming and numbering” function of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. ICANN — governed by a complex multistakeholder structure that incorporates many non state actors — will directly control what is essentially the address book of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. By delegating more <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to ICANN, the US will strengthen multistakeholderism, not just for ICANN, but as a broader principle of global governance. The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> has been, over the past two decades, a central site of struggle between multistakeholderism and multilateralism. By relinquishing its role as primus inter pares among states, the US seemingly will lose an important source of power over the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. And yet even as its power is diminished, the achievement of its preferences will be strengthened. This somewhat paradoxical story has important lessons not only for the exercise of state power over the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> but also for the evolution of global governance in a time when increasing numbers of nonstate actors across a range of international issues have achieved substantial participatory roles.</p>

<p>D. Clash between the privacy of children, UNCRC’S evolving capacities principle, and the freedom of commercial expression and speech It seems that the main dilemma in the matter of children participating in reality programs is the clash between two weighty interests: children’s rights and privacy on one hand, and commercial freedoms of expression and speech on the other. We begin with children’s rights, (163) including children’s dignity and the protection of their interests, which are all internationally recognized rights under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC). (164) Among the rights that could harmed are the child’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (165) and mental health. (166) There is also breach of privacy, (167) an important and internationally recognized value for children, (168) because they experience public emotional turmoil and cannot choose their audience and what to expose. (169) Intense and extensive exposure such as re-runs often results in hurt feelings and damage to the child’s personality. (170) Parents and broadcasters have a duty to protect children’s privacy. (171) Matters of the individual’s right to privacy, such as the prohibition against exposing a medical or emotional condition, or any other information about the individual’s private life, must not debatable. As discussed below, there is disagreement over other forms of violations of privacy. Paragraph 5 of the UNCRC describes the principle of evolving capacities. (172) According to this principle, children have certain inherent rights from the moment they are born, such as the right to food or security. (173) But other rights–autonomous rights–are granted to them gradually, according to their age and abilities, both physical and emotional. (174) This is so they will protected as they age, rather than be abandoned to their (175) Thus, for example, children are protected from being exposed to matters that are not suitable for their age that may cause them harm, supposedly in the name of fulfilling their rights. (176) The evolving capacities principle is also applicable when defining age groups for consent and participation in reality television. At times, children can care less about their privacy than adults. (177) Modern day children are active on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and frequently expose details about themselves on social networks. Therefore, at least at certain ages, it can assumed that they give genuine consent to such exposure, inasmuch as they control it. (178) Children do not give genuine consent when it comes to reality programs because broadcasters sometimes take advantage of their desire to become famous and thus their consent is not real. One must remember that children are not unionized nor are they considered employees, and in most countries there is no specific legislation that protects them. (179) When children expose their lives on a reality program, one must take a more paternalistic approach than one does with adults, and not leave them to their (180) In contrast to social networks, children cannot respond to a broadcast that portrays them in a certain way. This is even more important if the child did not agree to exposed on the program, and it was their parents’ wish that they filmed, as in docu-reality cases or on Nanny 911. The first natural and obvious protection against breaches of privacy is the parents’ and children’s consent, which serves also as contractual consent. It is possible to compare this situation to that of public figures, who are exposed by virtue of the positions they chose. (181) In this comparison, participants in reality programs who chose to exposed should also not have the right to privacy, or they should have only a weaker version of that right because they made their choice and they want to become famous. (182) But the situation is more complex, especially if a child’s consent is uninformed. We must also ask whether the children want to become famous at any cost. …</p>

<p>Author(s): Samuelson, Pamela | Abstract: Fair use has been invoked as a defense to claims of copyright infringement in a wide array of cases over the past thirty years, as when someone has drawn expression from an earlier work in order to parody it, quoted from an earlier work in preparing a new work on the same subject, published a photograph as part of a news story, made a time-shift copy of television programming, photocopied a document for submission as evidence in a litigation, reverse engineered a computer program to get access to interface information, cached websites to facilitate faster access to them, or provided links to images available on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, just to name a few.The wide array of fair use cases has led many commentators to complain that fair use is unpredictable. This Article argues that fair use law is both more coherent and more predictable than many commentators have perceived once one recognizes that fair use cases tend to fall into common patterns, or what this Article will call policy-relevant clusters. The policies underlie modern fair use law include promoting freedom of speech and of expression, the ongoing progress of authorship, learning, access to information, truth-telling or truth-seeking, competition, technological innovation, and privacy and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> interests of users. If one analyzes putative fair uses in light of cases previously decided in the same policy cluster, it is generally possible to predict whether a use is likely to be fair or unfair. Policy-relevant clustering is not a substitute for appropriate consideration of the statutory fair use factors, but provides another dimension to fair use analysis that complements four-factor analysis and sharpens awareness about how the statutory factors, sometimes supplemented by other factors, should be analyzed in particular contexts.Parts I through V mainly provide a positive account of how fair use has been adjudicated in a variety of contexts and suggestions about factors that should be given greater or lesser weight in certain fair use policy clusters. Its articulation of the policy-relevant clusters into which the fair use cases typically fall should not, however, be understood as attempting to limn the outer bounds of fair use or to foreclose the development of new policy-relevant clusters. Part VI offers a more normative account of fair use as an integral and essential part of U.S. copyright law that can, in fact, encompass the wide range of fair uses discussed in the Article. It also recaps the key lessons from this Article’s qualitative assessment of the fair use case law and points to some encouraging trends in recent cases.</p>

<p>The introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in our contemporary society imposes historically unique challenges for humankind. The emerging <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of AI holds unique potentials of eternal life of robots, AI and algorithms alongside unprecedented economic superiority, data storage and computational advantages. Yet to this day, it remains unclear what impact AI taking over the workforce will have on economic growth. The contemporary trend of slowbalisation is described, as the slowing down of conventional globalization of goods, services and Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) flows; yet at the same time, we still see human migration and air travel as well as data transfer continuing to rise. These market trends of conventional globalization slowing and rising AI-related industries are proposed as first market disruption in the wake of the large-scale entrance of AI into our contemporary economy. Growth in the artificial age is then proposed to be measured based on two AI entrance proxies of Global Connectivity Index and The State of the Mobile <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> Connectivity 2018 Index, which is found to be highly significantly positively correlated with the total inflow of migrants and FDI inflow – serving as evidence that the still globalizing rising industries in the age of slowbalisation are connected to AI. Both indices are positively correlated with GDP output in cross-sectional studies over the world.</p>

<p>Our society thrives on new technology and technological advance. We enjoy the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>, clothes that do not wrinkle or stain, and the wonders of medical biotechnology. A century of innovation has improved our lives in myriad ways. We are healthier, wealthier, and, if not necessarily happier, have a vastly greater variety of options for how to spend our leisure time. The marvels of technological advance are not always riskfree. The risks presented by new technologies can take varying forms: deleterious effects on human health or the environment, concerns about individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and privacy, or concerns relating to community or moral values.

<i> Gordon Hull </i></p>
<p>In U.S. v.American Library Association (2003), the Supreme Court upheld the Child <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> Protection Act (CIPA), which mandated that libraries receiving federal funding for public <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> access install content-filtering programs on computers which provide that access. These programs analyze incoming content, and block the receipt of objectionable material, in particular pornography. Thus, patrons at public libraries are protected from unintentionally (or intentionally) accessing objectionable material, and, in the case of minors, from accessing potentially damaging material. At least, that is the official story. In this paper, I develop three points. (1) I argue that CIPA and ALA are better read as examples of the enforcement of a regime of normative sexuality. The question of minors accessing pornography is only relevant to the official story insofar as it provides a rhetorically persuasive example of deviance from that normative regime. CIPAs full target includes information about topics such as homosexuality and contraception. (2) Rather than (or in addition to) punishing deviances directly, CIPA attempts to constitute a “public” in which such deviancy can never occur in the first place. Hence, the designation of a “public” space serves to domesticate alternative sexualities and to sanitize that space of sexual difference. (3) This interaction at the border of the public and private spheres offers an opportunity to reflect on and underscore the ways that subject formation and subjectivity are mediated through technological artifacts like the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>.</p>

But it’s the organization of and ultimately the knowledge and intelligence we extract from the information we receive that really matters. It can show us the areas of greatest non-compliance … and thereby, contributes to more efficient and effective compliance programs. –IRS Commissioner Doug Schulman (2011) (1) Every animate and inanimate object on earth will soon be generating data, including our homes, our cars, and, yes, even our bodies. –The Human Face of Big Data (2012) (2) Introduction Although the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has always been an information intensive agency, (3) its information-gathering never been the focus of privacy scholars. Those scholars have instead focused on agencies such as the National Security Administration (NSA). (4) But the IRS’s legal claim to private information is remarkable. It is entitled to collect information about who sleeps how often in your house, (5) your hobbies, (6) your reading preferences, (7) your religious affiliation, (8) your travel plans, (9) your weight and your doctor’s recommendations about it, (10) your spouse or your dependent’s abortion, sterilization, (11) or gender identity disorder, (12) and if you were considering a carnal quid pro quo when you made a gift to your mistress. (13) Yet, privacy scholars have taken no note of the IRS’s extraordinary legal claim to such information. From the reverse angle, despite the information-intensive aspects of tax law, tax scholars have not taken note of the increasing pervasiveness of information technology. (14) Modern technologies are creating minutely detailed records of our existence, (15) increasingly facilitating the persistent, continuous and indiscriminate monitoring of our daily lives. (16) One information privacy scholar described the radical and technological transformation of personal information: The small details that were once captured in dim memories or fading scraps of paper are now preserved forever in the digital minds of computers, vast databases with fertile fields of personal data…. Every day, rivulets of information stream into electronic brains to be sifted, sorted, rearranged, and combined in hundreds of different ways. Technology enables the preservation of the minutia of our everyday comings and goings, of our likes and dislikes, of who we are and what we are…. It is ever more possible to create an electronic collage that covers much of a person’s life–a life captured in records, a digital biography composed in the collective computer networks of the world. (17) A prominent national security advisor predicted that by 2040, all of our daily activities will be known by governmental and corporate pursuing the gush of data from the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> of things. (18) As we move towards such a future, the IRS most likely will be among those entities pursuing this growing gush of data. This Article suggests an agenda for discussion among privacy and tax law scholars: issues we ought to consider, research we ought to pursue, and debates we ought to have. In Part I of this Article, I describe the flow of tax-relevant information from taxpayers and third parties to the IRS. …</p>

These artworks carry both artistic and social messages. Such practices force us to reinterpret some elements of the classical art paradigm: its <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, authorship, uniqueness (as opposed to copies and series), and the social role of art. The analysis is aimed at Hungarian and Romanian online artistic projects from Transylvania region of Romania, relevant as intercultural communication endeavours.

<p>Although many are concerned that autonomous weapon systems may make war “too easy,” no one has addressed how their use may alter the distribution of the constitutional war power. Drones, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> operations, and other technological advances in weaponry already allow the United States to intervene militarily with minimal boots on the ground, and increased <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in weapon systems will further reduce risk to soldiers. As human troops are augmented and supplanted by robotic ones, it will be politically easier to justify using force, especially for short-term military engagements. Accordingly, one of the remaining incentives for Congress to check presidential warmongering—popular outrage at the loss of American lives—will diminish. The integration of autonomous weapon systems into U.S. military forces will therefore contribute to the growing concentration of the war power in the hands of the Executive, with implications for the international doctrine of humanitarian intervention.</p>

<p>‘Work-life balance’ (‘WLB’) emerged as the catchcry of workers everywhere in&nbsp;the late 20th century. It was particularly appealing to women lawyers as it was&nbsp;thought that if a balance could be effected between work and life, satisfying&nbsp;careers and the raising of children could be combined. The key to effecting this&nbsp;balance, it was believed, was flexible work. Technology has facilitated this&nbsp;flexibility as all that is required is a computer, or other device with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>&nbsp;connection, and a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>. Provided that the firm is agreeable, the lawyer&nbsp;would have a degree of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in determining when and where the work is&nbsp;carried out. However, flexible work has not always proved to be the boon that it&nbsp;was hoped, as the shift from face-to-face time to virtual time has blurred the&nbsp;boundary between work and life, insidiously extending the hours of work and&nbsp;impinging on the realm of intimacy. Drawing on a web-based survey and&nbsp;interviews with lawyers Australia-wide, this article considers the ramifications&nbsp;of perpetual connectivity for lawyers in private practice, with particular regard&nbsp;to its gender significance.

<p>Author(s): Van Houweling, Molly S | Abstract: The power and ubiquity of personal computing and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> have enabled individuals - even impecunious amateurs - to create and communicate in ways that were previously possible only for well-funded corporate publishers. These individual creators are increasingly harnessing law - insisting on ownership of their rights and controlling the ways in which those rights are licensed to others. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> users are demanding ownership of their online musings. Scholars are archiving their research online and refusing to assign their copyrights to publishers. Independent musicians are streaming their own songs and operating without record companies. Organizations like the Free Software Foundation are encouraging individual authors to manage their copyrights in innovative ways.When the myriad individual authors empowered by today’s ubiquitous digital technology claim, retain, and manage their own copyrights, they exercise a degree of authorial <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> that befits the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> Age. But they simultaneously contribute to a troubling phenomenon I call copyright - the proliferation, distribution, and fragmentation of the exclusive rights bestowed by law, and of idiosyncratic permutations of those rights. The information and transaction costs associated with atomism could hamper future generations of technology-fueled creativity and thus undermine the very purpose of copyright: to encourage the creation and dissemination of works of authorship for the ultimate benefit of the public.In this project I aim to place contemporary atomism in historical and doctrinal context by documenting law’s previous encounters with proliferated, distributed, and fragmented ownership. Along the way I examine how law has encouraged and discouraged atomism and managed its consequences. This history demonstrates the enduring relevance of my concerns within policy, highlights countervailing interests, and provides a framework for thinking about how to alleviate the unfortunate consequences of atomism - and how not to.</p>

<p>Traditional classrooms confine English as a Foreign Language (EFL) reading to the textbook and the classroom setting, something that demotivates active reading. With the advent of mobile technology, however, such boundaries can be broken to include external reading materials where students could read and share anytime and anywhere. This paper investigates the role of mobile technology in enhancing Learner <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> (LA) in the EFL reading context among students in the Preparatory Year (PY) of Najran University in Saudi Arabia. A reading class of 30 students utilised mobile applications (WhatsApp and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> search engines such as Google) to access external reading materials and interact with their peers and teachers outside the classroom. Qualitative data collection underwent a number of procedures. The baseline data was constructed from the students’ portfolios, which reported the participants’ traditional reading practices and use of mobiles. Then, the participants were encouraged to use <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> search engines and WhatsApp group to share their readings. Finally, five participants were interviewed. The data analysis revealed that the participants’ LA is improved through the use of selected mobile applications in terms of taking responsibility for and making decisions about reading materials and the time and place of reading. The study recommends further investigation into the role of mobile applications for generating learners’ own tasks and writing skills.</p>

In particular, the author focuses on Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Germany and France in the field of sex education of students who have laid the foundations of modern school sex education in Europe, paying special attention to gender policy, EU legal framework and Council of Europe in the field of school education. In Belgium, for example, society has a liberal attitude towards sex and sex education, moreover, sex education is a compulsory practice that offers schools considerable <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the development of curricula, including sex education. Italy is strongly influenced by the Catholic Church, so sex education is controversial in schools, and sex education programs are implemented as part of traditional classroom instruction, focusing mainly on the biological aspects of gender and behavior, adhering to the formation of traditional views on gender issues. based on the principles of morality. Luxembourg has open views on the issue of youth sexuality, the Netherlands shows one of the lowest levels of teenage pregnancy in the world, and the Dutch approach is often seen as a model for other countries. Attitudes toward sex education in Germany are characterized as liberal, accepted and recognized by federal law. This is due to the declining birth rate, which currently requires a rethinking of the position of politicians and the church on sex education and sex education of young people, while continuing to recognize the right of every citizen of the state to start a family. Sex education in France has a holistic approach and plays an important role in the sexual and emotional development of young people, helping them to resist the influence of the media and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. Improving the national systems of school sex education in the studied countries requires the formation of an effective gender policy in each country.</p>

<p>Although precise statistics do not exist, data suggests that the number of children believed to be at risk for commercial sexual exploitation in the United States is between 200,000 and 300,000 and that the average age of entry is between eleven and fourteen, with some as young as nine. The number of prostituted children who are criminally prosecuted for these acts is equally difficult to estimate. In 2008—the most recent year for which data is available—approximately 1500 youth under age eighteen were reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation as having been arrested within United States borders for prostitution and commercialized sex. Anecdotal evidence suggests, however, that these numbers reflect only a small fraction of the children who face criminal charges as a result of their prostituted status. Research also reveals that because most states have laws that hold children criminally liable for ―selling‖ sex, law enforcement and the courts readily pathologize these youth, a significant  Assistant Professor of Law, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Law (tbirckhe@<span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>.unc.edu).

Statistics additionally suggest that the number of American girls who are sexually exploited is increasing, particularly for those between the ages of thirteen and seventeen. Likewise, it is estimated that eighty percent of prostituted women began this activity when they, themselves, were younger than eighteen. Yet, nearly all states can criminally prosecute children for prostitution even when they are too young to legally consent to sex with adults, and very few communities have developed effective programs designed to prevent or intervene in the sexual exploitation of youth. This Article critically examines the prevalence of laws allowing for the criminal prosecution of minors for prostitution. It argues that rather than maintain a legal scheme that characterizes and treats such juveniles as willing participants who, if harmed, are merely getting what they deserve, a more nuanced approach must be developed in which—at a minimum— criminal liability should be consistent with age of consent and statutory rape laws. It analyzes the range of ways in which states have addressed the problem of prostituted children, and it highlights those few that have successfully utilized strategies of intervention and rehabilitation rather than prosecution and incarceration. It contrasts the impact of state versus federal legislation as well as domestic versus international policy in this area and examines the ways in which these differences serve to perpetuate pernicious stereotypes vis-a-vis youth and crime. The Article addresses the historical treatment of prostituted children as criminals rather than victims by both American law and society, and critiques contemporary rationales for continuing a punitive approach toward these youth. The Article explores the conflicting statutory, common law, and colloquial meanings of the terms ―prostitution,‖ ―consent,‖ and ―bodily <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>‖ as they relate to children and sexuality. It also considers the extent to which the criminal offenses of prostitution and statutory rape address different sets of harms and explores how gender and sexual orientation are implicated in the discussion.

<p>The future of online trust, innovation and self-regulation is threatened by a widening gap between users’ expectations informed by laws and norms, and new capacities for benefits and harms generated by technological advances. As this gap widens so too does ambiguity between asserted rights, interests, and threats. As a result society perceives heightened tensions and risks when engaging the Web. How do we narrow this gap and thereby lower risks of actions online in manner that instills trust, safeguards <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and promotes ingenuity? One part of this solution is to embrace the fundamental principles of ethics to guide our decisions in the midst of information uncertainty. One context where this solution is germinating is <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> security research. These research activities are prerequisite for evidence-based policymaking that impacts us individually and collectively, such as infrastructure security, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> crime, network neutrality, free market competition, spectrum application and broadband deployment, censorship, technology transfer, and intellectual property rights. Therefore, in the wake of struggles to resolve the aforementioned mounting tensions, ethics has re-emerged as a crucial ordering force. For this reason, ethics underpins the debate among <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> security researchers, oversight entities, industrial organizations, the government and end users about the acceptability of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> research activities.</p>

<p>The paper shows how and why Home-Based <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> Businesses are drivers of variety. This paper argues, by means of five theoretical perspectives, that because of the variety HBIBs generate, they contribute to the economy over and above their direct and indirect contributions in terms of revenue and employment. A multiple case study approach is employed studying the best practices of eight HBIBs. It is found that HBIBs generate variety because of the unique way in which they operate, and because of the reasons why they are started. How HBIBs operate can be captured in the acronym SMILES: Speed, Multiple income, Inexpensive, LEan, and Smart. They are founded (amongst other motives) for reasons of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, freedom and independence. Both aspects - the how and why - of HBIBs are conducive to the creation of variety as they facilitate trial-and-error commercialization of authentic ideas. Five theoretical perspectives posit that variety is important for the industry and the economy: evolutionary theory, strategic management, organic urban planning, opportunity recognition, and the knowledge economy. The findings are discussed in the context of each perspective.</p>

<p>This paper will look at the definition of a “data controller” within the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC and consider whether the phenomenom of social networking (through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> (FB), MySpace and Bebo) has produced unintended consequences in the interpretation and application of the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC to the online environment. The Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC defines a “data controller” broadly to refer to the ‘natural or legal person, public authority, agency or any other body which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of processing are determined by national or Community laws or regulations, the controller or the specific criteria for his nomination may be designated by national or Community law.’ If the definition of the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC (DPD) is applied literally to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> and MySpace, arguably, not only organisations such as FB and MySpace are regarded as “data controllers” (through Art. 4 of the DPD), but individuals who posted information about others (friends or work colleagues etc.) would also be regarded as “data controllers” and thus have to adhere to the legal rules laid down under the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC (ie. Art. 7 of the DPD fair and lawful processing; not excessive etc) unless it could be shown that the exemptions under Art. 9 that processing was intended for journalistic, artistic and literary purposes or that Art. 13 exceptions apply. As identified in an earlier paper, Art. 3.2 DPD (Wong and Savirimuthu, Art. 3(2) All or Nothing: This is the Question? The Application of Art. 3(2) Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC to the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>) is unlikely to apply whereby processing was carried out for private and domestic purposes. This paper is an attempt to address a definitional difficulty that the legislatures did not anticipate. In attempting to protect the privacy of individuals, it is now possible to argue that it is becoming easier for individuals (and not merely organisations) to be brought 1 Dr Rebecca Wong is Senior Lecturer in Law at Nottingham Law School, Nottingham Trent University with teaching and research interests in Tort, Intellectual property, Data Protection and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span> law.

<p>Firms increasingly seek to use <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>ies as sources of ideas, innovations, and designs. However, many such open innovation efforts lack sustained participation and ultimately fail. This research sought to understand motivations to participate in a firm-hosted design community and how the nature of the design task influences sustained participation. From an inductive study of a leading vehicle design community, we found project variety—across two dimensions of project <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and project complexity—supported a range of motivations to participate and the social practice of vehicle design. We discuss implications of our study for research on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>ies and for firms within the global vehicle industry.</p>

<p>Guided by theories of “management by exception,” we study the impact of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y on worker and plant manager <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and span of control. The theory suggests that information technology is a decentralizing force, whereas communication technology is a centralizing force. Using a new data set of American and European manufacturing firms, we find indeed that better information technologies (enterprise resource planning (ERP) for plant managers and computer-assisted design/computer-assisted manufacturing for production workers) are associated with more <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and a wider span of control, whereas technologies that improve communication (like data intranets) decrease <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for workers and plant managers. Using instrumental variables (distance from ERP’s place of origin and heterogeneous telecommunication costs arising from regulation) strengthens our results.

<p>The role of intellectual property is changing. IP traditionally is characterized as providing economic incentives to invest in creative production or as a reward for intellectual labor, and accordingly IP laws typically are associated with the needs of corporate creators and celebrity artists. In an era of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, however, IP has become a tool for a diverse range of vulnerable individuals to assert <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> within unequal and risky digital environments.</p>
<p>This paper examines cases in which IP is not being used to fortify economic incentives or reward labor but instead as a way to manage boundaries around sensitive and intimate social activities. These include lawsuits to combat the nonconsensual dissemination of sexual imagery and lawsuits by families of deceased artists and public figures to shape the cultural memory of the deceased. IP theory has often resisted addressing questions of sexual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, privacy, or family mourning, yet IP is playing an increasingly important role in mediating each. Many scholars have stressed that we no longer need IP laws to spur widespread creative activity in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> era; nevertheless, the social, emotional, and economic stakes surrounding control over image, sounds, and text arguably have never been greater.</p>
<p>This paper makes two main contributions. First, it shows that IP often provides an effective tool for managing personal and social boundaries and as a result reinforces <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, community, and kinship among the diverse group of individuals who become rights holders. Individuals are using the old tools of IP to tackle a new and different set of socioeconomic challenges. Second, as a normative matter, it argues that IP provides some important practical and conceptual advantages over other legal responses to sexual privacy and family mourning. IP delegates context-sensitive boundary-management decisions to individuals, families, and communities—as opposed to more top-down criminal or regulatory solutions—and can be transferred within communities and across generations—as opposed to more individualized tort and contract solutions. Although undeniably a break from traditional theory, IP can be a useful means of legally responding to emergent cultural vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>The world is constantly undergoing changes, and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> is being used as an important teaching resource. From the chalk piece to the computer, technology has been present in school as a link between action and learning for professors and students. Technological tools are more and more frequent in the class room: the computer along with its chief resource – the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> – have raised a debate about their effectiveness in school education. The use of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> in educational programs has revealed that this resource gives rise to educational environments which are different from that of the traditional attendance classes regarding the roles of teachers and students, the flow of information, the degree of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and participation of students, and the development of complex competencies such as those involving the resolution of problems. Nevertheless, experience shows that these results are useful and effective only when teachers are technically prepared for them. To educate using new technology is a challenge which has not yet been thoroughly tackled. Technology may help, but to educate is fundamentally to learn how to manage a set of information and turn it into something significant to the individual, namely knowledge. The introduction of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> into school programs acts as a catalyst for change. Therefore it is appropriate to consider this new tool as a precious aid to learning.</p>

<p>Purpose This paper aims to explore articulations of how individuals internalise official demands on handling COVID-19 and the function of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> in this process, and further to discuss this from a human rights’ perspective. Design/methodology/approach A thematic analysis of qualitative data from an international survey on COVID-19 and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. The analysis was inspired by Berger and Luckmann’s theory of reality as a social construction. Findings Articulations expressed an instant internalisation and externalisation of the officially defined “new normal”. However, negotiations of this “new normal” were articulated, whereby everyday life activities could proceed. Resistance to the “new normal” appeared, as routines and common sense understandings of everyday life were threatened. Health-care professionals were put in a paradoxical situation, living in accordance with the “new normal” outside work and legitimately deviating from it at work. The “new normal” calls for individuals’ “oughtonomy” rather than <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social media</span> were used to push individual’s re-socialisation into the “new normal”. The latter both promoted and challenged human rights as the individual’s right to self-determination extends beyond the self as it risks threatening other people’s right to life. Originality/value With the means of a theoretically based thematic analysis inspired by Berger and Luckmann, the current study shows how articulations on COVID-19 and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> can both support and challenge human rights and reality as a facticity as dictated by dominant organisations and discourses in society.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> and the ability to maintain social activities can be challenging for people with disabilities experiencing reduced mobility. In the case of disabilities that impact mobility, power wheelchairs can help such people retain or regain <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Nonetheless, driving a power wheelchair is a complex task that requires a combination of cognitive, visual and visuo-spatial abilities. In practice, people need to pass prior ability tests and driving training before being prescribed a power wheelchair by their therapist. Still, conventional training in occupational therapy can be insufficient for some people with severe cognitive and/or visio-spatial functions. As such, these people are often prevented from obtaining a power wheelchair prescription from their therapist due to safety concerns. In this context, driving simulators might be efficient and promising tools to provide alternative, adaptive, flexible, and safe training. In previous work, we proposed a Virtual Reality (VR) driving simula-integrating vestibular feedback to simulate wheelchair motion sensations. The performance and acceptability of a VR simulator rely on satisfying user Quality of Experience (QoE). Therefore, our simulator is designed to give the user a high Sense of Presence (SoP) and low <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span>-sickness. This paper presents a pilot study assessing the impact of the vestibular feedback provided on user QoE. Participants were asked to perform a driving task whilst in the simulator under two conditions: with and without vestibular feedback. User QoE is assessed through subjective questionnaires measuring user SoP and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-sickness. The results show that vestibular feedback activation increases SoP and decreases <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-sickness. This study constitutes a mandatory step before clinical trials and, as such, only enrolled people without disabilities.</p>

<p>AI-driven tools play an increasingly important role in the media: from smart tools that assist journalists in producing their stories to the fully automated production of news stories (robot journalism), from audience analytics that inform editorial decisions to AI-driven news recommendations. As such, AI-driven tools are more than simple tools. Within newsrooms, AI-driven tools exemplify potentially far-reaching structural changes in internal routines and divisions of responsibility between humans and machines. Within European media markets, the introduction of AI-driven tools brings with it substantial structural shifts and transformations of power. And from the perspective of users and society, AI-driven tools could result in new, smarter and more responsive ways of informing the public, but when applied wrongly, also have potentially a detrimental effect on the public sphere, on pluralism, privacy, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and equal chances to communicate. The right to freedom of expression in Article 10 ECHR is an important basis to inform law and policy makers on possible approaches to regulating AI in the media (including the European Commissionâ€™s ambitious plans for regulating AI), but can also more broadly inform our thinking about the potential and threats from AI for the realisation of freedom of expression, and the role of the media in that context. After an introduction to some of the recent developments around AI and algorithms in the news media, we will highlight some of the most pressing freedom of expression implications stemming from AI-driven tools in the news media. We will also show that the protection afforded under Article 10 ECHR comes with specific duties and responsibilities for the news media and reflect on the question of how to deal with AI-driven tools in a way that is compatible with fundamental rights and freedoms. Finally, we will explain that, while the introduction of AI-driven tools can create new opportunities for users to exercise their freedom of expression rights, the application of automated filtering and sorting can also result in new digital inequalities and unequal opportunities of access to information.</p>

<p>This paper introduces a virtual reality (VR) system which was designed to promote English speaking proficiency as learners carry out collaborative information gap tasks. In a former study, a simpler system was developed to explore the effect of modality on learners’ foreign language anxiety (FLA) where results suggested that anxiety was statistically significantly lower in the VR environment compared to a voice and video <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> system. However, of three key affordances—presence, interactivity, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>—the previous system only focused on presence. The current system features an interactive component also. In this paper, we present results of a study which compared the two systems (presence-only versus interactive system) with the aim of answering the question: Does more-fully utilizing the affordances of VR lower or increase learners’ FLA? In a counterbalanced design, 30 participants (15 pairs) completed a spot-the-difference task in two different VR environments: static-VR (former system) and interactive-VR (current system). Results of a post-experimental questionnaire suggested that there was no difference in participants’ FLA for the two domains. However, a significant difference was found in terms of ease of communication and enjoyment which favored the interactive-VR mode. Additionally, compared to predictions that the interactive-VR task would be more cognitively demanding, it was considered simpler than the static-VR task. This suggests that using more of the affordances of VR by increasing interactivity further may make the embodied experience more life-like and therefore increase opportunities for learning. This paper introduces the system, implications for researchers and teachers, and future research directions.</p>

<p>The article outlines the methodological aspects of forming the readiness of bachelors in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security for professional activities by means of collaborative learning in an educational and digital environment that can increase the level of their professional training. The readiness of a bachelor in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security for professional activity is outlined, which in essence is a selective and predictable activity of a bachelor in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security at the stage of its preparation for professional activity and arises from the moment of determining the purpose of activity on the basis of perceived needs and motives, personality plan, guidelines and models for future action. It is proved that the readiness of a bachelor in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security for professional activity can be formed by means of collaborative learning in an educational and digital environment. That is, the readiness of the bachelor of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security for professional activities, we can understand essentially selective and predictable activity of the bachelor of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security in the preparation for the profession and arises from the moment of determining the purpose of activities based on perceived needs and motives, personality plan, guidelines and models for future action. The structure of virtual modeling in the online laboratory for bachelors in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security in the educational-digital environment is determined, which consists of three interfaces: the interface of the higher education applicant, the interface of the teacher and the interface of the administrator. It is noted that it is important in the collaborative training of bachelors in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security that the environment in which they interact should be based on democracy, equality and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, with this rule training will be at a high level and as a result will be successful. The organization of collaborative training of bachelors in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security in an educational and digital environment should be based on the principles of social contact. It was found out that the main principles of collaborative learning in mobile applications for bachelors in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security in the educational-digital environment included the systematic establishment of social contacts during the training of bachelors in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security, development of communication, building relationships between bachelors in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security in educational digital environment on democracy and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, changing the role of participants in the educational process in time depending on the nature and nature of the problem and psychological comfort.</p>

<p>The harms associated with wireless mobile devices (e.g.&nbsp;<span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s) are well documented. They have been linked to anxiety, depression, diminished attention span, sleep disturbance, and decreased relationship satisfaction. Perhaps what is most worrying from a moral perspective, however, is the effect these devices can have on our <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. In this article, we argue that there is an obligation to foster and safeguard <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in ourselves, and we suggest that wireless mobile devices pose a serious threat to our capacity to fulfill this obligation. We defend the existence of an imperfect duty to be a ‘digital minimalist’. That is, we have a moral obligation to be intentional about how and to what extent we use these devices. The empirical findings already justify prudential reasons in favor of digital minimalism, but the moral duty is distinct from and independent of prudential considerations.</p>

<p>Digital innovation is ever more present and increasingly integrated into citizen science research. However, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s and other connected devices come with specific features and characteristics and, in consequence, raise particular ethical issues. This article addresses this important intersection of citizen science and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things by focusing on how such ethical issues are communicated in scholarly literature. To answer this research question, this article presents a scoping review of published scientific studies or case studies of scientific studies that utilize both citizen scientists and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things devices. Specifically, this scoping review protocol retrieved studies where the authors had included at least a short discussion of the ethical issues encountered during the research process. A full text analysis of relevant articles conducted inductively and deductively identified three main categories of ethical issues being communicated: <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and data privacy, data quality, and intellectual property. Based on these categories, this review offers an overview of the legal and social innovation implications raised. This review also provides recommendations for researchers who wish to innovatively integrate citizen scientists and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things devices into their research based on the strategies researchers took to resolve these ethical issues.</p>

<p>The corporations perceive human capital as the greatest potential for competitive advantage, and staff training as a prerequisite for achieving the company’s strategic aim since business success and market competitiveness directly depend on the ability of employees to provide life long learning. In the context of searching the ways of optimizing this process, the aim of our study is to determine the features and opportunities for the development of individualization of learning by means of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies in multinational corporations in Canada in order to use their experience in Ukrainian higher education. The set of interrelated general scientific research methods was used to achieve this goal: analysis, synthesis, comparison, generalization, systematization, which were used to study the scientific literature, programs and corporate training courses in multinational corporations in Canada. Analysis of training in Canadian multinational corporations shows that the use of the advanced <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies in independent non-formal learning, including mobile learning, social networks, Massive Open Online Courses, electronic coaching, corporate blogs, gamification, wikis, etc., contributes to the deepening of individualization of training, and the practice of employee’s independent planning and implementation of his/her learning process is becoming more common. The study concludes that individualization is an important aspect of training in Canadian multinational corporations. The basis of individualization of learning is self-direction, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of students, their willingness to take responsibility for planning and implementation of all stages of their learning.</p>

<p>The aim of the research is to identify specific of AI in healthcare, its nature, and specifics and to establish complexities of AI implementation in healthcare and to propose ways to eliminate them. Materials and methods: This study was conducted during June-October of 2020. Through a broad literature review, analysis of EU, USA regulation acts, scientific researches and opinions of progressive-minded people in this sphere this paper provide a guide to understanding the essence of AI in healthcare and specifics of its regulation. It is based on dialectical, comparative, analytic, synthetic and comprehensive methods. Results: One of the first broad definitions of AI sounded like “Artificial Intelligence is the study of ideas which enable computers to do the things that make people seem intelligent … The central goals of Artificial Intelligence are to make computers more useful and to understand the principles which make intelligence possible.” There are two approaches to name this technology - “Artificial intelligence” and “Augmented Intelligence.” We prefer to use a more common category of “Artificial intelligence” rather than “Augmented Intelligence” because the last one, from our point of view, leaves much space for “human supervision” meaning, and that will limit the sense of AI while it will undoubtedly develop in future. AI in current practice is interpreted in three forms, they are: AI as a simple electronic tool without any level of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (like electronic assistant, “calculator”), AI as an entity ith some level of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, but under human control, and AI as an entity with broad <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, substituting human’s activity wholly or partly, and we have to admit that the first one cannot be considered as AI at all in current conditions of science development. Description of AI often tends to operate with big technological products like DeepMind (by Google), Watson Health (by IBM), Healthcare’s Edison (by General Electric), but in fact, a lot of smaller technologies also use AI in the healthcare field – <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> applications, wearable health devices and other examples of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things. At the current stage of development AI in medical practice is existing in three technical forms: software, hardware, and mixed forms using three main scientific-statistical approaches – flowchart method, database method, and decision-making method. All of them are useable, but they are differently suiting for AI implementation. The main issues of AI implementation in healthcare are connected with the nature of technology in itself, complexities of legal support in terms of safety and efficiency, privacy, ethical and liability concerns. Conclusion: The conducted analysis makes it possible to admit a number of pros and cons in the field of AI using in healthcare. Undoubtedly this is a promising area with a lot of gaps and grey zones to fill in. Furthermore, the main challenge is not on technology itself, which is rapidly growing, evolving, and uncovering new areas of its use, but rather on the legal framework that is clearly lacking appropriate regulations and some political, ethical, and financial transformations. Thus, the core questions regarding is this technology by its nature is suitable for healthcare at all? Is the current legislative framework looking appropriate to regulate AI in terms of safety, efficiency, premarket, and postmarked monitoring? How the model of liability with connection to AI technology using in healthcare should be constructed? How to ensure privacy without the restriction of AI technology use? Should intellectual privacy rights prevail over public health concerns? Many questions to address in order to move in line with technology development and to get the benefits of its practical implementation.</p>

<p>Purpose This study aims to investigate how <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> services can improve the well-being of elderly consumers. Drawing on transformative service research (TSR) and technology adoption literature, it examines the main challenges for the elderly when adopting <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> services and how they and their family members can co-create value to improve the elderly service inclusion and well-being. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative methodology is used to identify challenges, value co-creation behaviors and well-being outcomes of elderly individuals and their family members when using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> services. The data collection method involved 24 in-depth interviews with consumers over 75 years of age and their family members. Findings This research first recognizes specific challenges for the elderly in adopting <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> services related to resistance to technology adoption and health impairments. Second, the findings identify value co-creation behaviors held by elderly consumers of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> services: learning and formal training, complying with indications and seeking help when they encounter problems with technology. Family members also contribute to elderly well-being through two value co-creation behaviors: helping and supporting elderly relatives with technology and being patient and tolerant when they need support. Finally, these behaviors are found to influence five dimensions of elderly consumers’ well-being: enjoyment, personal growth, mastery, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and social connectedness. Originality/value This study addresses a gap in the literature by exploring the value co-creation behaviors of elderly consumers of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> services and their family members for improving well-being outcomes. Understanding value co-creation and well-being for elderly consumers of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> services is an emerging and under-researched area in TSR and service inclusion literature.</p>

<p>This article addresses issues surrounding the social construction of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> addiction, focusing on conceptualisations of reality, escape, hope, and time. Drawing on a critical realist account of semiosis, the framing of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> addiction in China is analysed using the documentary film Web Junkie as an empirical pivot and point of departure. A contextual overview of relations, interests, and tensions surrounding youth and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> in China is provided, and the film Web Junkie is briefly presented. The main body of the article consists of a critical analysis of conceptualisations of “reality” and “escape.” The core tension focused on in the analysis is the struggle over time, necessitating engagement with critical thought on hope and utopia. The analysis concludes that struggles over temporal <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> underlie conflicting claims about “reality” and “escape” that are central to “<span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> addiction” and its treatment in China today.</p>

<p>Under the trend of “<span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>+Education”, the online and offline blended teaching mode has become an important direction of teaching reform. This article takes the course “Cooking Technology” as an example to build an online and offline blended teaching mode, and investigates the application of blended teaching in the teaching of applied undergraduate courses. Using empirical analysis and interview methods, the article found that the curriculum teaching of “Cooking Technology” has insufficient combination of theory and practice, single teaching mode, poor teaching effect, and heavy teaching tasks. Base on the principle of student-centered, pedagogical coherence, integration of theory and practice, this article designs the blended teaching activities for the “Cooking Technology” course from the three major links, which is the pre-course phase, in-class stage and after-school phase. This article puts forward the issues that should be focus on interaction in blended learning and teaching, establishing a reasonable and sound appraisal method, pay attention to the percentage of online instruction used, so as to provide reference and reference for the construction of “golden courses” of culinary majors and other majors. Finally, the study found that the blended teaching can better cultivate students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in learning and solve the basic problems that most students are not interested in learning.</p>

<p>In foreign language instruction, students are often exposed to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">computer-mediated</span> testing in international exams and language courses; however, regular classrooms are not equipped with computer labs to offer a lesson coherent with that testing procedure. To fill this gap, mobile-assisted language learning emerges as a portable option for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">computer-mediated</span> learning and testing. Hence, this action research aims to study the implementation of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s-assisted practice, combined with note-taking, as test-wise and test-management strategies, to tackle the needs of 218 participants who were taking an English as a foreign language program at a Colombian university. In the diagnostic stage, learners expressed that the most difficult computer-assessed skill was speaking, due to lack of confidence and suitable strategies. Findings revealed an improvement in students’ oral performance, collaboration levels, and high acceptance of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s-assisted practice as a test preparation tool that facilitates <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, metacognition, and peer-feedback.</p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) regulatory and other governance mechanisms have only started to emerge and consolidate. Therefore, AI regulation, legislation, frameworks, and guidelines are presently fragmented, isolated, or co-exist in an opaque space between national governments, international bodies, corporations, practitioners, think-tanks, and civil society organisations. This article proposes a research design set up to address this problem by directly collaborating with targeted actors to identify principles for AI that are trustworthy, accountable, safe, fair, non-discriminatory, and which puts human rights and the social good at the centre of its approach. It proposes 21 interlinked substudies, focusing on the ethical judgements, empirical statements, and practical guidelines, which manufacture ethicopolitical visions and AI policies across four domains: seven tech corporations, seven governments, seven civil society actors, together with the analysis of online public debates. The proposed research design uses multiple research techniques: extensive mapping and studies of AI ethics policy documents and 120 interviews of key individuals, as well as assorted analyses of public feedback discussion loops on AI, employing digital methods on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>ies specialising in AI debates. It considers novel conceptual interactions communicated across the globe, expands the regulatory, ethics, and technological foresight, both at the individual level (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, identity, dignity, privacy, and data protection) and the societal level (fairness/equality, responsibility, accountability and transparency, surveillance/datafication, democracy and trust, collective humanity and the common good). By producing an innovative, intercontinental, multidisciplinary research design for an Ethical AI Standard, this article offers a concrete plan to search for the Holy Grail of Artificial Intelligence: Its Ethics.</p>

<p>Problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> use (PIU) has become public health concern, particularly among adolescents and emerging adults. There is growing interest concerning the potential impacts of early maladaptive schemas (EMSs) on PIU and its most severe manifestation <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> addiction (IA). However, a deeper understanding of these relationships is needed regarding of effects of schemas on IA. The purpose of the present study was to explore the role of EMSs among adults.The sample comprised 714 Iranian participants who completed a self-report survey comprising sociodemographic variables, the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> Addiction Test (IAT), and the Young Schema Questionnaire-Short Form (YSQ-SF). The data were analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM).Findings indicated that there was a positive and significant relationship between EMS domains and IA. The results confirmed that disconnection/rejection schema domains and impaired <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>/performance schema domains were significantly related with IA. The results of the analysis of convergent validity and discriminant validity were acceptable among the nine reflective constructs.Findings of the present study indicated that existence of underlying EMSs may be a vulnerability factor for developing IA and adds to the growing body of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>psychology literature that has examined the relationships between the EMSs and IA.</p>

<p>The present study aimed to address to the dearth of research into the phenomenology of recovery among young people exposed to trauma.Using an interpretative phenomenological approach, we analyzed <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> forum data to consider how young people experience recovery from trauma.Five domains of recovery were identified: meaningful shifts in the sense of self, gaining control and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, establishing hope and commitment, making meaning out of tragedy, and engaging in normative activities and connecting with others. Participants described the experience of recovery as an ongoing, nonlinear and dialectical process that was not synonymous with cure and often took place in the context of supportive relationships.While the broad themes of recovery align with those derived from adult literature, the accounts diverge with respect to the content within the domains themselves. The findings suggest that services oriented to trauma-exposed young people need to bolster these internal processes of change, while also attending to their specific developmental needs and capacities.

<p><span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span>bullying victimization is associated with mental health problems and reported to occur more in nonheterosexual orientation youth (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and questioning (LGBQ)) than among heterosexual youth. Parental support may protect against mental health problems after being victimized, but nonsupportive parental influences may also exacerbate harm. This study investigated whether parenting dimensions (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support, psychological control) moderated the associations between bullying victimization and mental health problems among heterosexual and LGBQ adolescents. An anonymous survey was completed by 1037 adolescents (M age = 15.2 ± 1.9, 50% female). Regression analyses examined associations between victimization, sexual orientation, and mental health problems, and investigated the moderating role of parenting. Both forms of victimization were associated with higher mental health problems. LGBQ youth experienced more depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation than heterosexual youth. Lower levels of parental psychological control and higher levels of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support were related to having fewer mental health problems. However, perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support appeared less protective when adolescents experienced more frequent victimization. Moreover, parental psychological control was related to heightened risk for suicidal plans specifically among LGBQ youth and also exacerbated the association between <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying victimization and stress among LGBQ youth. These findings underscore the need to address parenting in whole-school antibullying and mental health promotion programs.</p>

<p>Purpose Online games are prevalent <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> applications and are known for satisfying the various needs of users. Nonetheless, little is known about whether online games could be a resort for users encountering workplace frustration. Explaining how workplace frustration and users’ need satisfaction affect loyalty of online gamers, this study aims to formulate hypotheses and develop a framework based on the self-determination theory (SDT). Design/methodology/approach The authors use an online survey to collect 848 responses and use structural equation modelling to test the hypotheses. Findings The authors find that workplace frustration, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> need satisfaction and competence need satisfaction are positively related to online gamer loyalty. Moreover, workplace frustration enhances the link between competence need satisfaction and online gamer loyalty. Originality/value The authors are the first to use SDT to identify the three antecedents and the moderator of online gamer loyalty. Our findings offer a key message that game providers could design effective means to retain their gamers by understanding their gamers’ workplace frustration and informing them that playing games could alleviate the associated negative feelings.</p>

<p>While in the 90s the New London Group advocated a definition of literacy that takes into account modes of expression other than written, today the comparison of different cultures (Cole, 1996) makes it more essential than ever to reflect on what kind of literacy enables integration into contemporary Western societies.We propose some ideas developed within the Italian L2 classes for refugees and asylum seekers from the DiCO education project, which is committed to promoting the research and the implementation of discoveries in contemporary glottodidactics research studies through training, workshops and innovative teaching and learning materials.The paper aims at both investigating the notion of literacy itself and illustrating some insights on possible digital literacy (Buckingham 2015) paths parallel to traditional literacy acquisition ones, with particular focus on the so-called media-literacy (ibid.) as a means to support learning and teaching.Some hands-on examples will be provided throughout the paper, presenting <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> built- in features that, by changing the shape of the educational content (Pireddu, Maragliano 2012), facilitate language acquisition of adult learners with low education. The research results lead to reflecting on the potential role of media literacy in the development of learners’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.</p>

<p>Abstract This article examines a subset of multilateral forums dealing with security problems posed by digital technologies, such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> warfare, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> crime and lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS). 1 It identifies structural issues that make it difficult for multilateral forums to discuss fast-moving digital issues and respond in time with the required norms and policy measures. Based on this problem analysis, and the recent experience of regulating <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> conflict and LAWS through Groups of Governmental Experts, the article proposes a schema for multilateral governance of digital technologies in armed conflict. The schema includes a heuristic for understanding human–machine interaction in order to operationalize accountability with international humanitarian law principles and international law applicable to armed conflict in the digital age. The article concludes with specific suggestions for advancing work in multilateral forums dealing with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> weapons and lethal <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.</p>

<p>In this paper, we explore how cryptocurrencies have been received in Sweden and Japan, and what specific attitudes and discourses may reveal about the ethical implications surrounding this new technology. By way of topic modelling prevalent discourses on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> among users of cryptocurrencies, and teasing out the more culturally situated significance in such interactions through discourse analysis, our aim is to unpack the way certain tropes and traces around the notion of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> may provide a fruitful lens through which we may discern how this technology has been received in each respective country. The ultimate aim of the paper is to shed light on the attitudes that inform the way this technology is perceived and the cultural and ideological nuances that this brings to the fore, as well as how this culturally nuanced view may help us better discern the potential advantages and ethical challenges associated with this new technology.</p>

<p>The evolution of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies has changed the way we relate to each other and how we build our knowledge. This creates challenges for education systems, as school must provide all students with the educational experiences that will enable them to develop the skills reflected in the profile of the 21st-century student on com pletion of compulsory schooling. It is up to teachers to find new ways of teaching, making the most of the resources and digital tools made available by mobile technologies. Technology can make a significant contribution to increasing students’ motivation because it is closer to what they like and use in their daily lives. And this introduction of technology into the classroom can promote student-oriented teaching, which contributes to the development of skills such as <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, critical thinking and self-esteem.
 One of the areas that can contribute to this paradigm shift is the creation of experiences in immersive learning environments such as Transmedia Storytelling. Immersive learning environments can favour the creation and implementation of projects that promote reading skills in schools. This is the focus of this article.
 The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of transmedia storytelling on the level of motivation of students and on the improvement of pedagogical practices implemented by the teachers involved. This case study was carried out in the subject of Portuguese in three 7th-grade classes of a school from the Médio Tejo region.
 The results obtained suggest a high level of motivation of students and teachers. The latter recognise that pedagogical routes using Transmedia Storytelling contribute to the motivation, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and improvement of students’ learning.</p>

<p>The article investigates the problem of developing motivation for learning of higher education students in the process of linguistic and professional training in the conditions of distance learning. Motivation for learning is interpreted as a system of external and internal motives for learning, the hierarchy and interaction of which is formed under the influence of pedagogical conditions, has a multilevel structure, the formation levels of which can be assessed by a certain criteria and indicators. The specific factors of motivation for learning are characterized, the reasons for the motivation decrease of students of non-language specialities when studying a foreign language are regarded. The necessity of realizing the principles of subjectivity, professionally-oriented technological effectiveness, interactivity, independence (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>), communicativeness, consciousness, accessibility, and stages in the linguistic and professional development of students in the conditions of distance learning is proved. The active introduction of distance learning technologies to the education system of Ukraine is emphasized. The distance learning is interpreted as a system of professionally oriented training of students constructed in a certain way in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> environment. The effectiveness of distance learning and the specifics of designing individual educational routes of higher education students are substantiated. The main tasks and imperatives of linguistic and professional training of future specialists are determined. The special importance of improving the goals, content, forms and methods of teaching in order to increase motivation for learning of students is emphasized.</p>

<p>Abstract Calls for a European “third way” in matters of digital technology need to be put into action to achieve an actual change of the status quo. To achieve <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the digital sphere, European alternatives to digital services and products need to be established. However, such efforts must also extend to the level of information technology infrastructure. To that end, decentralized indexing of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> could significantly help to strengthen Europe’s digital sovereignty. Nevertheless, legal challenges need to be overcome to make that vision a reality.</p>

<p>Smart manufacturing is a challenging trend being fostered by the Industry 4.0 paradigm. In this scenario Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are particularly elected for modeling such types of intelligent, decentralised processes, thanks to their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in pursuing collective and cooperative goals. From a human perspective, however, increasing the confidence in trustworthiness of MAS based <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span>-physical Production Systems (CPPS) remains a significant challenge. Manufacturing services must comply with strong requirements in terms of reliability, robustness and latency, and solution providers are expected to ensure that agents will operate within certain boundaries of the production, and mitigate unattended behaviours during the execution of manufacturing activities. To address this concern, a Manufacturing Agent Accountability Framework is proposed, a dynamic authorization framework that defines and enforces boundaries in which agents are freely permitted to exploit their intelligence to reach individual and collective objectives. The expected behaviour of agents is to adhere to CPPS workflows which implicitly define acceptable regions of behaviours and production feasibility. Core contributions of the proposed framework are: a manufacturing accountability model, the representation of the Leaf Diagrams for the governance of agent behavioural <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and an ontology of declarative policies for the identification and avoidance of ill-intentioned behaviours in the execution of CPPS services. We outline the application of this enhanced trustworthiness framework to an agent-based manufacturing use-case for the production of a variety of hand tools.</p>

<p>It is well documented that social interactions have a crucial impact on all aspects of personal development for adolescents, however few studies have documented how social interactions affect a young person’s sense of sexual agency. The aim of the current qualitative study was to examine young people’s perceptions of their own sexual agency in relation to their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> attitudes and behaviors. Participants (n = 31) were recruited from a nonprofit organization and asked to complete a one-hour in-depth interview and a demographic survey. Using an inductive method, involving constant comparison, we identified four overarching themes: (a) Participants utilize different <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms for distinct purposes and are cognizant of each audience; (b) Based on past experiences, participants have negotiated and created their own rules of engagement for online behavior; (c) Participants have different expectations about how others should act online versus how they act in relation to flirty or sexual messages; (d) Participants were concerned about the authenticity of online identities and are aware of vulnerability in online interactions. Our results highlight the need for sexual health researchers to observe social network etiquette closely through the lens of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and agency.</p>

<p>This article discusses how Shosana Zuboff’s critical theory of surveillance capitalism may help to understand and underpin responsible practice and innovation in mobile journalism. Zuboff conceptualizes surveillance capitalism as a new economic logic made possible by ICT and its architecture for extracting and trading data products of user behavior and preferences. Surveillance is, through these new technologies, built into the fabric of our economic system and, according to Zuboff, appears as deeply anti-democratic and a threat to human sovereignty, dignity, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. In Europe, the framework of responsible research and innovation is promoted as an approach and a meta-concept that should inform practice and policy for research and innovation to align with societal values and democratic principles. Within this approach, ICT is framed as a risk technology. As innovation in mobile journalism is inextricably tied to the technologies and infrastructure of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms, the apparent question would be how we can envision responsible innovation in this area. Zuboff provides a critical perspective to study how this architecture of surveillance impedes the practice of mobile journalism. While the wide adoption of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s as a key tool for both producing and consuming news has great potential for innovation, it can also feed behavioral data into the supply chain of surveillance capitalism. We discuss how potentially harmful implications can be met on an individual and organizational level to contribute to a more responsible adoption of mobile technologies in journalism.</p>

<p>Direct and indirect criminological risks of the use of robotics are analyzed and issues of responsibility of the manufacturer (developer)and/or owner (user) of robotics are discussed for acts committed with their participation. This essay discusses promising areas of legal research related to robotics and its corresponding legal regulations. The definition of robotics is based and proposed as all categories of robots in their broadest sense, regardless of their purpose, degree of danger, mobility, or <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, as well as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-physical systems with artificial intelligence in any form. It is proposed to recognize socially dangerous acts committed with the use of robotics as crimes committed in a generally dangerous way if there are grounds for doing so. It is concluded that the commission of acts through robotics is capable, in certain cases, of creating a plurality of crimes in the form of a real aggregate. The expanding powers of State security bodies, which can carry out the functions of state policy development, legal regulation, control, and supervision in the field of robotics application, have been verified.</p>

<p>This paper reports the positive impact of international collaboration, utilization of technology and the Independent Learning Centre Program (ILCP) on student confidence and personal achievement. During 2008-2009, Concordia Lutheran College (CLC), an Australian K-12 school and Patrick County High School (PCHS), an American secondary school worked together to deliver the Independent Learning Centre Program (ILCP) as developed by Carmichael (2008). This project utilized the Learning Activity Management System (LAMS) as a support system for delivery. The purpose of the online delivery was to make available to Patrick County High School, the teaching and learning strategies enhancing independent learning skills for information literacy and differentiated instruction (Tomlinson, 2003) via the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. The program gave students in both schools the opportunity to collaborate internationally and engage in a research topic of personal interest.

<p>Purpose The emergence of mHealth applications has led to the rise of health-based services delivered over <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s. Younger people are often found to be more innovative toward technology, especially related to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s (Rai et al.&nbsp;, 2013). Most mHealth application downloaders are continually shifting between applications because of the hyper-competition making achieving loyal consumers challenging (Racherla et al.&nbsp;, 2012). The purpose of this paper is to study the determinants that help increase young consumers mHealth application loyalty. This study integrates self-determination theory (SDT), gamification elements and engagement to examine loyalty. Design/methodology/approach A valid sample of 263 college student’s data was obtained for data analysis from a survey conducted in multiple campuses of the Delhi University in India. Findings The three psychological needs: need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, need for competence and need for relatedness, showed a positive impact on intrinsic motivation. From the gamification factors; perceived playfulness, the level of challenge and social interaction, only the first two showed a positive impact on extrinsic motivation. Both motivation factors influence engagement, showing a frequent interaction with the application, leading to loyalty. Originality/value Previous studies examined the adoption of mHealth services, this study is one of the first to examine young consumers’ loyalty in using mhealth apps. It sheds light on the existing literature and contributes to research on mHealth applications by determining the factors that lead to loyalty by the young consumers.</p>

<p>The article deals with theoretical and practical aspects of the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies of training in philosophy classes in the process of professional training of future specialists in labor protection. The author analyzed the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies during training sessions - lectures and seminars on philosophy, preparation of abstracts and scientific works on the specified discipline. It is revealed that the systematic use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies of teaching allows creating a fundamentally new information educational sphere, thus providing wide opportunities for educational activities, greatly affects the redistribution of roles among its participants, increases motivation, develops <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, provides individualization and differentiation of the educational process , contributes to the modernization of the traditional education system. All this makes it possible to improve the quality of learning. The article states that the inclusion of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies in the educational process creates a network environment in which education becomes a sequence of social contacts, each of which is communication. Thanks to the use of modern <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies, in particular in philosophy classes, the teacher has the opportunity to use all the necessary tools for effective assimilation and perception of the researched issues. Lectures become more saturated with factual material, and students listen more, rather than writing under dictation, which is positively perceived by listeners. Modern multimedia technologies, opening students access to non-traditional sources of information, increase the efficiency of independent work in philosophy, provide completely new opportunities for creativity, finding and consolidating new professional skills, allow to implement fundamentally new forms and methods of learning, which certainly has a positive effect on the common activities of teacher and student in the process of studying philosophy.</p>

<p>The development of electronic communication brings to rapid language and speech-communicative changes. These changes make the scientific task of their timely conceptualization urgent. The purpose of this study is to generalize and analyze the research results on the onyms functioning in the electronic environment and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> communication. The analysis highlights two the main areas of the research that have developed in science to date. The functioning of the proper name in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> discourse is the study object of the first group. The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> environment is mainly a source of language material according to this group research, which is analyzed considering the electronic communications features (its polycode, informality, interactivity). The feature of this group research is that its’ the main object is represented either by specific linguistic phenomena or special types of discourse, while electronic communication is a secondary feature for its highlight. The second research direction involves the study of new onomastic phenomena that owe their existence to the context of the electronic environment and its communicative, pragmatic, and technical features. This research direction implies both the detection of new types of onyms that were generated by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> communications, and the description of their characteristic semantic, pragmatic, stylistic, and formal grammatical features. A special status among the objects studied in the second direction is given to such a phenomenon as a nickname, which implements a whole set of features that allow us to talk about its principal novelty and uniqueness. A nickname is the result of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in terms of pragmatic and communication. This contributes to its use as a means of self-presentation and expression; also, a nickname has noticeable formal features that represent the ways of its construction (free choice of motivational bases, language play, active use of non-alphabetic characters). There is also noted an impact of new phenomena in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> onomastics on the onomastic system and emphasized the need for closer attention to this influence.</p>

<p>Learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is considered as one of the most important factors contributing to lifelong learning for language learners studying at university. This is primarily because learners were likely to feel motivated and engaged when they were given the freedom to take charge of their learning. Higher Education in Oman has been relatively a recent phenomenon that was introduced three decades before. Ministry of Higher Education in Oman emphasis developing lifelong learning and self-study skills in learners studying at a higher educational institution in Oman. Most of the learners studying at higher educational institutions were taught by the native Arab speakers in schools, and they were mostly dependent on their teachers for the completion of different academic tasks in schools. Learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is now not desired but the obligatory aspect of learning under the current unprecedented circumstances where learners were required to take control of their learning, complete their tasks, assignments and projects on their own and where teacher intervention is minimal due to ‘remote teaching’ situation. The prevalent situation where technology has now taken the pivotal role in shaping the 21st century teaching and learning process, it is high need for the EFL learners studying at tertiary level at the university should be autonomous and critical thinkers who can control of their learning process and aware of the necessities of learning. Therefore, considering the learners’ spoon-feeding learning attitude at school and fast-changing learning requirement, the researcher aimed at identifying learners’ understanding and perceptions to achieve <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in learning in an EFL Context. This study also aims at finding out learners’ belief on the role of peers, teachers and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> in achieving <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in learning. By using mixed method approach, the researcher designed a 35-items Likert scale questionnaire and semi-structured interview questions to record the perceptions of 135 EFL learners studying at tertiary level in a private university in Oman. The results of the current study revealed that students were aware of the concept of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and they believe that teacher’s scaffolding, peer intervention and use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms can not only help them to foster <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in them but also to gain confidence, motivation, self-esteem, sense of responsibility and self-determination in an EFL language learning environment. The implications of this research will assist the EFL teachers and the administration to consider EFL learners learning needs and learners’ self-efficacy and attitude towards their own learning.</p>

<p>Making research and publishing these researches at academic journals is accepted as a differential feature in the academic world. Previous studies Show the evidence that work engagement is a significant predictor of performance. In this study, the relationship between work engagement, which is assumed as substitute for performance, and job resources is examined. At least one university from each city of Turkey is selected and academicians of those universities are sent 20- items survey via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>. 422 academicians is reached by using convenience sampling method. Job resources are subject to second order confirmatory factor analysis. Further, both for job resources and work engagement discriminant validity, convergent validity and composite reliability test are implemented. The results are analyzed with structural equation modelling. The results indicate that, job resources (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, social support, coaching, opportunity for personal development and task significant) need to be enhanced in order to develop work engagement of Turkish academicians.</p>

<p>During every waking moment, we must engage with our environments, the people around us, the tools we use, and even our own bodies to perform actions and achieve our intentions. There is a spectrum of control that we have over our surroundings that spans the extremes from full to negligible. When the outcomes of our actions do not align with our goals, we have a tremendous capacity to displace blame and frustration on external factors while forgiving ourselves. This is especially true when we cooperate with machines; they are rarely afforded the level of forgiveness we provide our bodies and often bear much of our blame. Yet, our brain readily engages with autonomous processes in controlling our bodies to coordinate complex patterns of muscle contractions, make postural adjustments, adapt to external perturbations, among many others. This acceptance of biological <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> may provide avenues to promote more forgiving human-machine partnerships. In this perspectives paper, we argue that striving for machine embodiment is a pathway to achieving effective and forgiving human-machine relationships. We discuss the mechanisms that help us identify ourselves and our bodies as separate from our environments and we describe their roles in achieving embodied cooperation. Using a representative selection of examples in neurally interfaced prosthetic limbs and intelligent me<span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>ronics, we describe techniques to engage these same mechanisms when designing autonomous systems and their potential bidirectional interfaces.</p>

<p>Emerging global social movement and media activist practices are integrating intersectional politics into technologically facilitated activism. Based on a multiyear empirical study, this article proposes a preliminary theoretical framework that maps 5 key dimensions of an emergent intersectional technopolitics : (1) intersectional anticapitalist politics enacted in meta-issue movements; (2) distributed online–offline media architectures and motility; (3) multiplicities of genres, forms, technologies, and spaces; (4) translocal solidarity economies and technologies; and (5) liberatory intersectional mechanisms of collective <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The author argues that intersectional technopolitics is an innovative and complex set of coherent global social movement and media activist practices rooted in meta-issue movements integrated with transmedia digital technologies. The article concludes with a critical analysis of contradictions encountered by intersectional technopolitics activists as they interact with the structures of broader social movements, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> technologies, and societal hierarchies.</p>

<p>There is a&nbsp;growing interest in Europe for the concepts of “digital sovereignty” and “strategic <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>space”. Although their meanings are different, they are closely linked and both refer to the will of European political and economic actors to maintain their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in their strategic decision process. For the European states, it involves acquiring an autonomous capacity of appreciation, decision and action in order to exercise their sovereignty.

Technological developments will create (to create), access (to access), manage (to process), and utilize (to utilize) information precisely and accurately. Information is a very valuable commodity in the era of globalization to be mastered in order to increase the competitiveness of an organization in a sustainable manner. This phenomenon is important to study, because this system is expected to be a solution related to the implementation of effective, efficient, transparent and accountable local governments for efforts to prevent corruption by utilizing the application of this technology. This type of legal research used by researchers is empirical sociological legal research. Empirical sociological legal research that includes research on legal identification (unwritten) and research on legal effectiveness. Data collection was carried out by interview, observation and literature study. This study aims to analyze the effectiveness of the implementation of electronic-based regional <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> on efforts to prevent corruption (a case study of the Bekasi City and Regency Government). The conclusion is that the effectiveness of the implementation of electronic-based <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is not optimal, there are still problems that there is no national integrated SPBE governance, SPBE has not been applied to the implementation of government administration and public services as a whole and optimally, the reach of ICT infrastructure to all regions and to all levels of society not optimal, the limited number of ASN employees who have ICT technical competence. based on the substance of the regulations, it is necessary to regulate the authority of the central government and local governments in managing e-government.

<p>Independent journalism on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> networks appears to be changing the world of journalism. Building on Bourdieu’s field theory, the present study looked at journalists’ perceptions of values expressed in their online activities as compared to traditional news values. In-depth interviews were conducted with leading journalists active on traditional and online platforms in Israel in order to better understand journalists’ perceptions of the journalistic culture on the two kinds of platforms. The study found that by strongly emphasizing <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, online platforms empower journalists to embrace new values, including public service and immediacy. A public service ideology has expanded into online efforts to actively promote diverse issues that are not necessarily covered by traditional media. Immediacy is now dictated by the features of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, which force journalists to respond in real time to all events relevant to their cause. Two values in the model of journalistic culture were found to be incompatible with the features of journalists’ online operations, and the ethics and objectivity of traditional journalism have been completely replaced by the online journalists’ orientation towards promoting their personal opinions, ideologies and agendas.</p>

<p>This paper explores how first-year students experienced emergency online teaching during COVID-19 and aims at understanding individual experiences related to basic psychological need satisfaction, considering different levels of contextual facilitators for learning activities involving technology in higher education derived from the C-flat model. Employing a case study approach, interviews of 15 chemistry students were qualitatively analyzed. The results show negative effects of lacking <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> connectivity and concurrence of learning and home spaces but positive effects of ceased commute between home and campus. Teachers’ implementation of digital learning opportunities was perceived as adequate but did not sufficiently address the overwhelming increase in students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and decrease in social relatedness. Students’ self-regulation skills as well as skills to initiate and maintain social contacts for interactive learning activities and for motivational support emerged as crucial aspects. Many students were not able to cope appropriately and students’ need satisfaction during emergency online teaching appeared to be related to students’ prior need satisfaction resulting in five groups of students, with two being relatively resilient and three being vulnerable to the disruptions of regular onsite teaching. Implications for further research and practice are discussed. • First year students experienced overwhelming <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> during emergency online teaching. • Students struggled with maintaining social contacts for learning and motivational support. • Coping abilities are related to earlier study related psychological need satisfaction. • Lacking <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and concurrence of learning and home space are major problems. • Teaching via webinars provides structure, but interactive teaching forms are needed.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has placed schools around the world under unprecedented challenges where saving students’ lives is placed ahead of education as a priority. Within these conditions of distress and uncertainty, education authorities had no choice but to move traditional classes into online ones to ensure the sustainability of studies. The abrupt inevitable decision has been a first for most if not all teachers and students who are invited to cope with a totally new teaching/learning model without necessarily having prior experience in Distance Learning in terms of apparatus or techniques. This study comes as an in-progress appraisal of the D-learning scenarios proposed by Moulay Ismail University (MIU) in Meknes, Morocco, based on a two-level evaluation model (Reaction and Learning) proposed by Daniel Kirkpatrick. It is a real-time evaluation of a learning strategy that has long been considered optional for some students, to become, rather, a plan A constituent for many education departments around the world. The study investigates areas of success and failure from the students’ perspective via 4 sub-indicators: accessibility, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, retention and psychological impact. The study concludes that the figures can be more reassuring about the D-learning experience in MIU once issues related to connectivity and communication are redressed.

<p>Digital technologies are increasingly becoming an integral part of our daily routine and professional lives, and the healthcare field is no exception. Commercially available digital health technologies (DHTs - e.g.&nbsp;<span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s, smartwatches and apps) may hold significant potential in healthcare upon successful and constructive implementation. Literature on the topic is split between enthusiasm associated with potential benefits and concerns around privacy, reliability and overall effectiveness. However, little is known about what healthcare professionals (HCPs) have experienced so far with patients and what they perceive as the main advantages and disadvantages of adoption. This study therefore aims to investigate current perceptions of HCPs towards self-tracked health-related outputs from devices and apps available to the public.Nine HCPs volunteered to take part in semi-structured interviews. Related data were thematically analysed, following a deductive approach with the construction of a framework based on expected themes from the relevant literature, and themes identified from the first two interviews.The following main themes in relation to DHTs were identified and explored in detail: HCPs’ experience, knowledge and views; advantages and disadvantages; barriers towards healthcare implementation and potential solutions; future directions. While most participants were adopters of DHTs and held positive views about them, their overall experience with patients and the technology was limited. Potential reasons for this were explored, including factors such as time/resources; colleagues’ mindset; lack of evidence of effectiveness for practice; data security concerns.The potential advantages of DHTs’ adoption in healthcare are substantial, e.g.&nbsp;patient <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, time/resources saving, health and behaviour change promotion, but are presently premature. Therefore, future research is warranted, focussing on addressing barriers, minimising disadvantages, and assessing the clinical value of commercially available DHTs.</p>

<p>The technological progress in the social field in a sudden way, specifically in the pedagogical field due to the spread of COVID-19, has had to force and use new teaching and learning strategies. As one of these many teaching processes is the method known as e-learning, which has become more valuable and very important in these times due to the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The research method applied is descriptive, correlational, cross-sectional and predictive. The sample applied in this research is 608 students of the 5th grade of secondary education in the province of Sullana, Piura region of Peru. The results reveal the existence of a very significant influence in almost all the dimensions of the study. The dimensions with the highest association values are participation-<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, outcome resolution, decision concepts and decision outcomes. The dimensions with the lowest strength of association are undoubtedly the motivation rating, which can be interpreted as meaning that motivation does not have a strong influence on the results. It can be concluded that the application of the e-learning method in the teaching of 5th grade high school students in the area of mathematics is positively valued, although a strong incidence of the method on the grades is not observed, due to the fact that a lower percentage of students were unaware of the application of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies for online learning. In addition, women tend to rate <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and participation more positively than men when the aforementioned teaching method is applied.</p>

A traditional message emphasized the benefits of avoiding SMU, whereas a values-alignment message framed controlling SMU as being consistent with <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and social justice. Compared to no message or a traditional message, in both studies, a values-alignment message led to greater motivation to control SMU immediately afterward, and in Study 2, awareness of “addictive” <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> designs 3 months later.

<p>Serendipity refers to unexpected encounters with ideas or insights and their intentional application to achieve favorable outcomes. Despite extensive prior studies, the concept lacks theoretical logic and empirical validation regarding the role of an intentional act in the relationship between serendipitous encounters and their favorable outcomes. Drawing from self-determination theory, we develop a model that highlights the role of needs satisfaction in explaining this relationship. Positioning the empirical context to fortunate discoveries of information and social connections in professional use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span>, we validate the model by a cross-sectional survey study of 473 users. The model builds on the observation that individuals’ serendipitous encounters are associated with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span>-enabled innovation, that is, a contextualized form of task innovation. The study findings support the research model revealing that serendipitous encounters are positively associated with needs satisfaction and that needs satisfaction is positively associated with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span>-enabled innovation. In other words, fortunate discoveries of new information and contacts increase <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span> users’ intent to utilize the platform in new ways to accomplish work when the three key psychological needs of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness are satisfied.</p>

<p>The Schrems I and Schrems II judgments (C-362/14 Maximillian Schrems v Data Protection Commissioner EU:C:2015:650 and C-311/18 Data Protection Commissioner v <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> Ireland Limited and Maximillian Schrems EU:C:2020:559) are well known for the sweeping implications that the law student’s crusade against the data giant <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> had on international data transfers and for the ensuing headache that they gave to companies, as well as to legislators and public authorities on both sides of the Atlantic. What has remained slightly unexplored, on the other hand, are the constitutional side effects of the combined operation of the two judgments on the relationship between the right to an effective remedy and Member States’ procedural <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. In its first part, therefore, this article will review the unusual procedural path that, on the basis of the first Schrems ruling, brought the second Schrems case from the Irish Data Protection Commissioner to the Court. The second part will examine the consequences of the two judgments on effective judicial protection, in particular on the extent to which those appear to create an obligation for the Member States to provide new remedies where the rights of individuals are infringed by secondary EU law.</p>

<p>Drawing from the literature of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> as a public sphere, the present study investigates online news comments related to sexual reproductive health of people with disabilities (PWDs) published in The New York Times and The Guardian . We analyzed 3,633 online comments published between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2019, using thematic analysis. The findings revealed eight major themes: economic consequences; gender; stereotypes; awareness and education; independence and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>; medical standpoint; media portrayal; and social justice and accommodation. Further, our study found that 47% of online commenters from The NYT and 49.3% from The Guardian had a positive perception that PWDs should have equal access to sexual reproductive health, compared with non-disabled people. Our study also revealed that comments in The NYT were more focused on the legal issues in the United States, while comments in The Guardian emphasized positive media representation and human aspects of the issue.</p>

<p>Abstract The present study aimed to identify psychological barriers which potentially prevent individuals from implementing collaborative car use in their every-day mobility behaviour. We suggested a model consisting of four psychological barriers: <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> Loss, Privacy Invasion, Interpersonal Distrust, and Data Misuse. Perceived Financial Benefit was included as a main incentive for collaborative car use. Using two samples, a community (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;176) and a student sample (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;265), three forms of peer-to-peer collaborative car use were examined: lending your own car to another private person (Lending To), renting a car from another private person (Renting From) and sharing rides with others (Ridesharing). For all three forms, a standardised questionnaire was developed which included the psychological barriers, self-reported collaborative car use intention and behaviour, and evaluations of scenarios. The results showed that different barriers predicted specific forms of collaborative car use: <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> Loss was connected negatively with Ridesharing and Privacy Invasion predicted Lending To negatively. Data Misuse was related negatively with Renting From, when the renting was arranged via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>. Interpersonal Distrust showed no predictive value for collaborative car use. Perceived Financial Benefit was a consistent incentive for all forms of collaborative car use. Overall, the results confirm the relevance of psychological barriers for collaborative car use. Practical implications to overcome the psychological barriers are discussed.</p>

<p>Changes in mobile technologies, developments in information technologies and telecommunication, computers programs and expansion of mobile market, likewise have inspired people to make use of these “anytime” and “anywhere” technologies in second language teaching. Use of mobile devices in language teaching has been the focus of language learning studies since language learning necessitates interaction and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> which are the key concepts in mobile assisted language learning for learners.
 The research aims at investigating Iraqi EFL secondary school students’ perceptions towards using mobile language learning technique.
 To achieve the aim of the present research, a sample of 40 secondary school students were chosen randomly from many schools .
 To fulfill the aim of the study, the questionnaire of students consists of (17) items. After the analysis of the data, the findings indicated that the vast majority of students had had used their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s to study English. Also, they expressed their welcome towards using this technology to study English in the future.
 It is recommended to promote the use of mobile learning devices, and encourage students to use mobile as a means of learning and teaching English language in various stages of education.</p>

Summary
</h2>
<h3 class="anchored">
Background
</h3>
Self-binding directives instruct clinicians to overrule treatment refusal during future severe episodes of illness. These directives are promoted as having the potential to increase <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for individuals with severe episodic mental illness. Although lived experience is central to their creation, the views of service users on self-binding directives have not been investigated substantially. This study aimed to explore whether reasons for endorsement, ambivalence, or rejection given by service users with bipolar disorder can address concerns regarding self-binding directives, decision-making capacity, and human rights.
<h3 class="anchored">
Methods
</h3>
This qualitative study used data from an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>-based survey distributed to the mailing list of the UK charity Bipolar UK, which contained multiple closed and open questions on advance decision making for patients with bipolar disorder. We included participants who reported that they have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder by a professional (doctor or psychiatrist). In a previous study, quantitative analysis of a closed question about self-binding directives had shown endorsement among a high proportion of participants with bipolar disorder who completed the survey. In this study, we did a thematic analysis of responses from those participants who answered a subsequent open question about reasons for their view. Research was done within a multidisciplinary team, including team members with clinical, legal, and ethical expertise, and lived experience of bipolar disorder. Ideas and methods associated with all these areas of expertise were used in the thematic analysis to gain insight into the thoughts of individuals with bipolar disorder about self-binding directives and associated issues.
<h3 class="anchored">
Findings
</h3>
Between Oct 23, 2017, and Dec 5, 2017, 932 individuals with a self-reported clinical diagnosis of bipolar disorder completed the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> survey, with 565 individuals (154 men, 400 women, 11 transgender or other), predominantly white British, providing free-text answers to the open question. 463 (82%) of the 565 participants endorsed self-binding directives, of whom 411 (89%) describing a determinate shift to distorted thinking and decision making when unwell as their key justification. Responses indicating ambivalence (37 [7%) of the 565 responses) were dominated by logistical concerns about the drafting and implementation of self-binding directives, whereas those who rejected self-binding directives (65 [12%] of the 565 responses) cited logistical concerns, validity of their thinking when unwell, and potential contravention of human rights.
<h3 class="anchored">
Interpretation
</h3>
This study is, to our knowledge, the first large study assessing the reasons why mental health service users might endorse or reject the use of self-binding directives. The findings provide empirical support for introducing self-binding directives into mental health services as well as advance decision-making practice and policy, and might help address enduring ethical concerns surrounding possible implementation of the directive while a person retains decision-making capacity. The opinions expressed here in responses given by multiple service users with bipolar disorder challenge a prominent view within international disability rights debates that involuntary treatment and recognition of impaired mental capacity constitute inherent human rights violations.

<p>Technology has posed many challenges to the teaching methods and materials of English as a second language. English teachers have to switch over to hi tech-based productive teaching methods from the conventional chalk and board method which no longer appeals to students of an entirely new generation of English learners with changing needs. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>, the most widely used type of social networking service, can be explored as an alternative learner- friendly mode of learning English. Irrespective of social status, most of the students own <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s with net facilities and students can be motivated to use them for improving their communication skills while they enjoy communicating with their circle of friends the matters that matter most to them. This paper proposes to examine the viability of the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">facebook</span> as a strategy of doing (communicating) as learning (English) to improve students’ conversational, commentary, and information-sharing skills in English and to assess how it contributes to learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The central hypothesis of the proposed paper is that students enjoy communicating through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">facebook</span> their thoughts, feelings, and values and they do not feel any constraints in doing so. The very act of communicating that they are reluctant in formal classroom atmosphere becomes a rewarding experience and motivating factor. The proposed study intends to employ empirical method for collection and interpretation of data.</p>

<p>Information posted by youth in online <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> contexts is regularly accessed, downloaded, integrated, and analyzed by academic researchers. The practice raises significant social justice considerations for researchers including issues of representation and equitable distribution of risks and benefits. Use of this type of data for research purposes helps to ensure representation in research of the voices of (sometimes marginalized) youth who participate in these online contexts, at times discussing issues that are also under-represented. At the same time, youth whose data are harvested are subject (often without notice or consent) to the risks associated with this research, while receiving little if any direct benefit from the work. These risks include the potential loss of online social community as well as threats to participant rights and wellbeing. This paper explores the tension between the social justice benefit of representation and considerations that would suggest caution, the latter including inequitable distribution of research-related costs and benefits, and the traditional ethics concerns of participant <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and privacy in the context of youth participation in online discussions. In the final section, we propose guidelines and considerations for the conduct of online <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> research to assist researchers to balance and respect representational and participant rights or wellbeing considerations, especially with youth.</p>

<p>Objective: To analyze the symbolic violence related to COVID-19 and the elderly on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. Methods: Qualitative research with a Brazilian case study as investigation strategy. The data collected for analysis were Brazilian memes published on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Instagram</span> <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. Such memes were randomly selected by searching the words “elderly” and “quarantine”. In order to analyze as much material as possible, nineteen memes were selected. Content analysis, as proposed by Bardin, was used to investigate data supported by QSR NVivo® software. Results: Two categories for analysis emerged from the connection observed on the content of the memes selected: the elderly stigmatization and their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> denial. Final Considerations: The analysis of the study allowed interpreting that aged people have been constantly experiencing symbolic violence linked to COVID-19 on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>.</p>

<p>Abstract Freedom of thought is not directly protected as a right in the United States. Instead, US First Amendment law protects a range of rights that may allow thoughts to be expressed. Freedom of speech has been granted especially robust protection. US courts have extended this protection to a wide range of commercial activities judged to have expressive content. In protecting these rights, US jurisprudence frequently relies on the image of the marketplace of ideas as furthering the search for truth. This commercial image, however, has increasingly detached expressive rights from the understanding of freedom of thought as a critical forum for individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Indeed, the commercialisation of US free speech doctrine has drawn criticism for “weaponising” free speech to attack disfavoured economic and regulatory policies and thus potentially affecting freedom of thought adversely. The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> complicates this picture. This paper argues that the Supreme Court’s expansion of the First Amendment for the benefit of commercial actors lies in the problematic tension with the justification for individual freedom of thought resting in personal self-direction and identity.</p>

<p>The need to move away from autonomous academic endeavors toward a more inclusive process involving all stakeholders in higher education provides the backdrop for this article. The introduction of the Paradigm of <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> and arguments for moving away from this view to one of collaboration and inclusion is framed within the context of educational outcomes and assessment. Research has shown that limited work has been done across institutions in developing “shared” outcomes and assessment across curriculum and “values.” The Electronic Portfolio (utilization of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> as a platform for wide distribution and discussion of materials) is introduced as a mechanism to harness information technology for achieving the objectives of developing discourse on achieving acceptance of wide-ranging outcomes and assessment measures. The involvement of all stakeholders in the process, particularly those beyond the academy, is seen as an integral part of building an emerging paradigm of collaboration and inclusion in the development of shared outcomes and assessment metrics. The use of the Electronic Portfolio as the information technology vehicle is described in some detail.</p>

<p>This paper presents a system for realistic behavioral programming of virtual characters, based on personality and probabilistic automata. We describe personality by using the Five-Factor Model and achieve <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> through a goal-oriented approach. Each character perceives the surrounding world, decides how to behave and acts on the environment according to its personality and to its goals. The chief idea explored by the proposed approach is that personality has a probabilistic influence on behavior selection instead of a deterministic one. Different behavior sequences available to achieve a goal are modeled using probabilistic automata and making probability dependent on character personality. This leads to non-repetitive behaviors, whose evolution is not foreseeable. The paper first motivates the approach in the context of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>therapy. Then, it summarizes related work and illustrates in detail the proposed approach. Finally, it presents obtained results and discusses the main limitations of the implemented system.

<p>Driven by the rapid pace of technical innovation in biosensing, artificial intelligence, the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things and wearable computing, the next generation of smart devices will be worn on-body, eventually becoming implanted. The increasing presence of these new forms of interactive technologies, known as biowearables , in children’s lives poses critical ethical concerns. In this position paper, we take a design ethics perspective to identify and describe four cases of ethical importance associated with biowearables, children, and long-term use. The cases concern potential negative impacts of specific aspects of biowearables on children’s identity formation, the development of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and agency , and what sources of information children turn to for authority about themselves. Drawing on ethical discourse related to emerging technologies and biowearable computing, we present prospective guidance for designers, where it is available. Where guidance is nascent or missing, we propose future research areas that could be addressed. In particular, we propose the importance of teaching children about computer ethics through hands-on critical reflection during design and technology activities. Our results will be of interest to the human–computer interaction community as well as to technology developers, educators, parents and those involved in policy formation around emerging technologies.</p>

<p>In the era of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things (IoT), emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies provide various artificial <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> features that allow intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) to assist users in managing the dynamically expanding applications, devices, and services in their daily lives. However, limited academic research has been done to validate empirically artificial <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and its downstream consequences on human behavior. This study investigates the role of artificial <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> by dividing it into three types of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in terms of task primitives, namely, sensing, thought, and action <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Drawing on mind perception theory, the authors hypothesize that the two fundamental dimensions of humanlike perceptions—competence and warmth—of non-human entities could explain the mechanism between artificial <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and IPA usage. Our results reveal that the comparative effects of competence and warmth perception exist when artificial <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> contributes to users’ continuance usage intention. Theoretically, this study increases our understanding of AI-enabled artificial <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in information systems research. These findings also provide insightful suggestions for practitioners regarding AI artifacts design.</p>

<p>The aim of a study was to reconstruct manifestations of children’s e-culture generated in the course of children’s <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> communication at selected web sites (<span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>, MovieStarPlanet, Gry.pl). Data were accumulated in a netnographic manner. Processing (text, visual and audio-visual) data and their interpretation was performed by a qualitative content analysis, which revealed many peculiar manifestations of children’s culture. This includes an absence of temporal and spatial boundaries of children’s culture, the mediated nature of its members’ contacts, the involvement of children in the network, the existence of culture in external memory, the electronic character of culture creations and their ephemeral and peculiar nature. This indicates the new, digital nature of children’s culture, which seems to produce an increase in children’s community-related actions and strengthens their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and their resistance potential towards the school and increases their participation in the digital culture, which serves to break down barriers between children.</p>

<p>With globalization, digitalization, and the spread of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies, rules regulating work have been softened or completely abolished. Consequently, employees face additional cognitive demands to plan, structure, and coordinate their work. To capture these demands of contemporary work, we constructed and initially validated the Cognitive Demands of Flexible Work (CODE) scale. The scale comprises four subscales (i.e., structuring of work tasks, planning of working times, planning of working places, and coordinating with others). We initially validated the scale in three independent studies (overall N = 1,129) in German and English. Confirmatory factor analyses supported the four-factor structure, as well as scalar invariance, of the different language versions. Moreover, the subscales showed convergent and divergent validity with related constructs such as requirements for problem solving or <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The criterion validity for emotional exhaustion, engagement, positive work rumination, negative work rumination, and problem-solving pondering suggested that cognitive demands of flexible work can be construed as challenge demands. However, relationships with emotional exhaustion were not significant. Overall, the CODE scale was shown to be a reliable and valid instrument to measure cognitive demands of flexible work.</p>

<p>Me<span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>ronic and soft robotics are taking inspiration from the animal kingdom to create new high-performance robots. Here, we focused on marine biomimetic research and used innovative bibliographic statistics tools, to highlight established and emerging knowledge domains. A total of 6980 scientific publications retrieved from the Scopus database (1950–2020), evidencing a sharp research increase in 2003–2004. Clustering analysis of countries collaborations showed two major Asian-North America and European clusters. Three significant areas appeared: (i) energy provision, whose advancement mainly relies on microbial fuel cells, (ii) biomaterials for not yet fully operational soft-robotic solutions; and finally (iii), design and control, chiefly oriented to locomotor designs. In this scenario, marine biomimicking robotics still lacks solutions for the long-lasting energy provision, which presently hinders operation <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. In the research environment, identifying natural processes by which living organisms obtain energy is thus urgent to sustain energy-demanding tasks while, at the same time, the natural designs must increasingly inform to optimize energy consumption.</p>

<p>The world’s population is forecasted of having 68% to be urban residents by 2050 while urbanization in the world continues to grow. Along with that phenomenon, there is a global trend towards the creation of smart cities in many countries. Looking at the overview of studies and reports on smart cities, it can be seen that the concept of “smart city” is not clearly defined. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and communication technolog</span>y have often been being recognized by the vast majority of agencies, authorities and people when thinking about smart city but the meaning of smart city goes beyond that. Smart city concept should come with the emphasizing on the role of social resources and smart urban governance in the management of urban issues. Therefore, the “smart city” label should refer to the capacity of smart people and smart officials who create smart urban governance solutions for urban problems. The <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in smart cities allows its members (whether individuals or the community in general) of the city to participate in governance and management of the city and become active users and that is the picture of e-democracy. E-democracy makes it easier for stakeholders to become more involved in government work and fosters effective governance by using the IT platform of smart city. This approach will be discussed more in this paper.</p>

<p>Technology has posed many challenges to the teaching methods and materials of English as a second language. English teachers need to switch over to hi tech-based productive teaching methods from the conventional chalk and board method which no longer appeals to students of an entirely new generation of English learners with changing needs. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>, the most widely used type of social networking service, can be explored as an alternative learner- friendly mode of learning English outside classroom. Irrespective of social status, most students own (smart) <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s with the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> connectivity and they can be motivated to use it for improving their communication skills while they enjoy communicating with their circle of friends the matters that matter most to them. This paper proposes to examine the viability of the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> as a strategy of doing (communicating) as learning (English) to improve students’ conversational, commentary, and information-sharing skills in English and to assess how it contributes to learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The central hypothesis of the proposed paper is that students enjoy communicating through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> their thoughts, feelings, and values and they do not feel any constraints in doing so. The very act of communicating that they are reluctant in formal classroom atmosphere becomes a rewarding experience and motivating factor in the virtual world. The proposed study intends to employ empirical method for collection and interpretation of data.</p>
