<p>Millions of people contribute to online content daily, allowing them to share their ideas and influence public conversations. Some have attached much enthusiasm and hope to such activities as they may result in a variety of benefits, including cultural empowerment, engagement with the political process, and collective knowledge production. While these considerations cast the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> as a potentially equalizing platform, research has shown that certain groups of people are more likely to participate in such online activities than others. All existing research on this topic has relied on cross-sectional data, making it impossible to make causal arguments about what results in more or less online engagement. That is, while research has found, for example, that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> skills are related to online participation, the cross-sectional nature of the data makes it difficult for scholars to disentangle the causal effect between the two variables, that is, whether higher skills result in more participation or whether more participation leads to higher skills, or both. In this paper, we draw on a unique panel survey data set that includes data about the same 547 young adults from 2009 and 2012 to address these questions. We consider how demographic factors, socioeconomic status as well as various <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> experiences such as veteran status, frequency of use, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of use, self-efficacy and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> skills may influence people’s participation online, from editing Wikipedia to taking part in online forum discussions, posting reviews and voting on others’ content. We find that far from being universal, only a small portion of respondents have ever participated in several of these types of online activities, and some have never engaged in any of them. Despite the study’s focus on young adults who have grown up with digital media, not only is participation not universal, there are systematic differences in the types of people who are more or less likely to participate. We show that young adults with higher levels of Web-use skills are more likely to engage in various online production activities than their less-skilled counterparts. In particular, those from more privileged backgrounds, i.e., whose parents have higher levels of education, are more likely to contribute their voices to online conversations. This paper makes a special contribution to the growing literature on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> skills by examining how three different measures of this concept relate to online engagement. We look at a universal <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> skills measure, we include a measure of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> self-efficacy, and we test the effect of a more nuanced measure of Web-use skills. We find that self-efficacy and skill have independent effects on the outcome of online engagement suggesting that research on people’s online know-how should not collapse these conceptually different variables. The paper ends with the policy implications of the findings for achieving a universally empowered <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> citizenry. Findings suggest that simply having grown up with digital media does not result in either universal know-how about the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> nor universal online engagement suggesting that interventions are important to make sure that people from all backgrounds have the necessary skills to take advantage of all that the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> has to offer.</p>

<p>Motives for Sport Participation as Predictors of Motivation Outcomes in Track and Field: A Self-Determination Theory Perspective Two types of motivation, intrinsic and extrinsic, have been of particular interest to researchers in the field of sport psychology (Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985, 2000, 2008; Vallerand, 1997, 2001). Intrinsic motivation entails participation in an activity for the feelings of fun, pleasure, excitement, and satisfaction associated with it, while extrinsic motivation involves participation for the attainment of such rewards as money, trophies, and social approval or to avoid punishment. One of the most widely applied theoretical approaches to these types of motivation is self-determination theory, or SDT (Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985, 2000; Ryan, 1995; Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000). SDT also involves the concept of amotivation, or having no sense of purpose and lacking intent to engage in a particular behavior. SDT posits that the different types of motivation range on a continuum from high to low self-determination: intrinsic motivation–extrinsic motivation–amotivation (Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985, 2000). Vallerand (1997, 2001) embraced elements of SDT and integrated them within a hierarchical theory of motivation. His model asserts that social factors, mediators (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness), motivations, and consequences (affect, cognition, and behavior) exist at three levels, the global level, contextual level, and situational level. A number of studies have indicated that behavioral regulations spanning the SDT continuum would lead to a corresponding pattern of consequences (Ratelle, Vallerand, Chantal, &amp; Provencher, 2004; Sarrazin, Vallerand, Guillet, Pelletier, &amp; Cury, 2002; Standage, Duda, &amp; Ntoumanis, 2003; Standage &amp; Vallerand, 2008; Taylor, Ntoumanis, &amp; Standage, 2008; Vlachopoulos, Karageorghis, &amp; Terry, 2000; Wilson, Rodgers, Fraser, &amp; Murray, 2004). That is, autonomous regulations and intrinsic motivation are expected to correspond with more positive outcomes, whereas less self-determined forms of regulation (external and introjected regulations) correspond with more negative outcomes, such as poor focus, burnout, and dropout. Vallerand’s proposals have found broad support in a range of sport and physical activity contexts (Standage et al., 2003; Wilson et al., 2004; Ntoumanis, 2001, 2005; Spray, Wang, Biddle, &amp; <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Chat</span>zisarantis, 2006); however, to date no study has examined these proposals in the context of a single sport. The purpose of the present study was to examine the extent to which motives for sport participation predicted motivation outcomes at the contextual level of motivation, thus affording a direct test of Vallerand’s (1997, 2001) model. On the basis of previous work (Ntoumanis, 2001; Vallerand &amp; Bissonnette, 1992; Pelletier, Fortier, Vallerand, Tuson, Briere, &amp; Blais, 1995; Ntoumani &amp; Ntoumanis, 2006), it was hypothesized that identified regulation and the dimensions of intrinsic motivation would be significant positive predictors of motivation outcomes, while amotivation would be a significant negative predictor. Method Participants A sample of 159 volunteer track and field athletes was tested at eight athletics clubs in the London, United Kingdom, area (66 women and 93 men). Their mean age was 19.7 years (SD = 2.8). English was the first language of all participants. Full details of the ethnicity and level of participation of participants can be requested from the second author. Eighty-five athletes participated in sprint events (53.5%), 30 in middle distance events (18.9%), 33 in throwing events (20.7%), 4 in long-distance events (2.5%), and 7 in multievents (4.4%). Their years of experience in track and field ranged from 1 to 18 (M = 5.8 years, SD = 3.5). Measures Sport Motivation Scale. The 28-item Sport Motivation Scale (Pelletier et al.&nbsp;…</p>

<p>This article describes the constructs of autonomous and controlled, i.e.&nbsp;deeply and superficially internalized, motivation, suggested in self-determination theory, and their application to religious studies.Autonomously motivated activity is performed because it is interesting, personally important and consistent with the values ​​of an individual; controlled motivation comes from the “outside”, either literally (rewards and punishments) or metaphorically (shame and guilt, conditional self-esteem). The theory of self-determination describes the various effects of autonomous and controlled motivation in different areas - depending on its motivation, the same activity may have opposite effects on human well-being. Autonomous motivation is associated with psychological well-being positively, and controlled motivation negatively.The phenomenon of the opposite effect of two types of motivation of the same activity is confirmed in application to religion; also, these types of motivation are associated with the specific religious phenomena - literal or symbolic interpretation of the objects of faith and extremism. Several authors make recommendations on the ways to support the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and psychological well-being of parishioners. The empirical part of the paper presents the results of the validation of the Russian version of the questionnaire of autonomous and controlled motivation in religion (Intrel). Items related to different motivational constructs (subtypes of autonomous and controlled motivation) having sufficient variance and consistency of responses were identified on an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> sample of Orthodox Christians; selected items were factored. Constructed scales of autonomous and controlled motivation in religion showed good psychometric properties.</p>

<p>This research examines the relationships between peer aggression (bullying) and psychological well-being in students from different professional areas of San Marcos University: Health Sciences, Humanities, Social Sciences, Basic Sciences, Engineering and Economic Enterprise. To do this, Scale Peer Violence relates to Espelage (attitude toward violence, prosocial behavior, aggressive behavior and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying) with Scale of Ryff Psychological Well-Being (positive relationships, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, mastery of environment, personal growth and purpose in life). The study is descriptive-correlational, using an non-probability sampling of the population considered. Instruments mentioned were psychometrically analyzed to fit our reality. As a result it was found that supportive behaviors are linked to the acceptance of itself, use skills and clarity of personal goals; on the contrary, the favorable attitude toward aggressive behavior is associated with low self-acceptance and the mismanagement of the opportunities offered by the environment. Finally, differences were found in age, gender and professional areas.</p>

<p>Recent studies show that, in the process of becoming part of our lives, technological innovations, such as computers and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, have produced important psychological transformations. Little is known, however, about the psychological impacts of another new technology: mobile telecommunication. The results of an exploratory investigation into the use of cell phones by young inhabitants of Rio de Janeiro suggest that mobile telephony is also generating psychological changes. In addition, they indicate that such changes are consistent with the new subjective organization - fluid and ever-changing - described by several analysts of the present era. In the case of these youngsters, the most important changes detected are related to: their increased <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, freedom and privacy; the increased intimacy that characterizes many of their relationships; the emergence of new forms of interpersonal control; their increased sense of security and the feeling of never being alone.</p>

<p>In Portugal, as in other countries, questions regarding <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>tion for promoting personal development and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, citizenship and cohesion and as a methodology of communication, facilitation and interaction between people and groups, have developed in various areas of social organisations. Mediation practices have been strengthening their conceptual and empirical grounding for the following reasons: an increased recognition of their social and educational potential, and as a result of the high level of fragility regarding the stability, convenience, and social cohesion of current society. Mediation, as a qualification and empowerment of individuals, is centred on people, social groups, and communication skills for coping with multiple problems. Mediation is, therefore, recognised as a potential practice that increases the development of a desire in individuals and groups to construct the dynamics of non-violent and participatory interactions.

<p>Subsumed under the umbrella of User Experience (UX), practitioners and academics of Human-Computer Interaction look for ways to broaden their understanding of what constitutes ‘’pleasurable experiences’’ with technology. The present study considered the fulfilment of universal psychological needs, such as competence, relatedness, popularity, stimulation, meaning, security, or <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, to be the major source of positive experience with interactive technologies. To explore this, we collected over 500 positive experiences with interactive products (e.g., <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s, computers). As expected, we found a clear relationship between need fulfilment and positive affect, with stimulation, relatedness, competence and popularity being especially salient needs. Experiences could be further categorized by the primary need they fulfil, with apparent qualitative differences among some of the categories in terms of the emotions involved. Need fulfilment was clearly linked to hedonic quality perceptions, but not as strongly to pragmatic quality (i.e., perceived usability), which supports the notion of hedonic quality as ‘’motivator’’ and pragmatic quality as ‘’hygiene factor.’’ Whether hedonic quality ratings reflected need fulfilment depended on the belief that the product was responsible for the experience (i.e., attribution).</p>

<p>People increasingly rely on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social network site</span>s (SNSs) to find out timely information about crises. Thus, emergency managers are interested in how people participate and how to promote their participation in SNSs after crises. Based on self-determination theory, this study develops a theoretical model to examine the mechanisms through which different types of motivation contribute to various participating behaviors in SNSs after crises. Survey data were collected after the Ya’an earthquake, which occurred in China on April 20, 2013. Our results show that while autonomous motivation is positively related to posting new content about the earthquake, controlled motivation is positively related to commenting on others’ content about the earthquake. Furthermore, perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and perceived relatedness are positively related to autonomous motivation. We suggest that emergency managers may want to promote different types of motivations, depending on the specific participating behavior preferred after crises.</p>

<p>Purpose The purpose of this paper is to discuss some ethical issues in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> encounter between customer and bank. Empirical data related to the difficulties that customers have when they deal with the bank through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> technology and electronic banking. The authors discuss the difficulties that customers expressed from an ethical standpoint. Design/methodology/approach The key problem of the paper is “how does research handle the user’s lack of competence in a web‐based commercial environment?” The authors illustrate this ethical dilemma with data from a Danish Bank collected in 2002. The data have been structured by an advanced text analytic method, Pertex (by generation of intentionality of verbal actors from text). Findings The authors can conclude that the experience of lack of competency in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> banking implies a severe damage on the experience of the ethics of the good life and of the respect for the basic ethical principles of customer <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, dignity, integrity and vulnerability. However, increased experience of competency may imply experience of increased feeling of ethical superiority and of the good life among customers. Research limitations/implications The important implication for managerial research of this study would be for banks to focus on customer competency with an ethical concern instead of only being concerned with technical solutions for effective <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> operations. Practical implications Since more and more businesses are digitally based, the authors can foresee a potential generic problem of lack of competence for certain age groups and also of people from different social groups. Originality/value The paper provides an analysis of the ethics of on‐line banking on the basis of Pertex methodology and with the use of basic ethical principles of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, dignity, integrity and vulnerability.</p>

<p>Mobus is a cognitive orthotic designed for people with difficulties managing Activities of Daily Living (ADL), as encountered in schizophrenia. It provides a schedule manager as well as the possibility to report occurrences of symptomatic experiences. Receiving this information by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, caregivers can assist the patient rehabilitation process. Our aim was to explore the use and satisfaction of Mobus by people with schizophrenia. Nine outpatients tested Mobus for 6 weeks. Indicators of cognitive functioning and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> were measured with the CAmbridge Neuropsychological Tests Automated Battery (CANTAB) and the Independant Living Skills Scale (ILSS). On average, 42.6% of the planned ADL were validated and more than 1 symptom per week were reported. Mainly because of technical breakdown, more than 50% of the outpatients evaluated the Mobus satisfaction below 1.7/5, nevertheless 3 participants appreciated it greatly. Some enhancements were found on subscales of CANTAB and ILSS and some participants reported that they acquired planning skills by using Mobus. To ensure ease of use, refinements are needed from rehabilitation and technical approaches, especially to personalize the device. Discussions on ethical and methodological issues lead to an improved version of Mobus that will be tested with a larger sample size.</p>

The questionnaire was animated using cartoon characters that are familiar to most children and the questions appeared on screen and were read aloud by actors. Exploratory principal component analysis of the online version of the questionnaire supported the existence of five components in line with the paper version. The items loaded on the components that would be expected based on previous findings with five domains—physical well-being, psychological well-being, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and parents, social support and peers, and school environment. Internal consistency reliability of the five domains was measured using Cronbach’s alpha, and the results suggested that the scale scores were reliable. The domain scores were similar to those reported in the literature for the paper version. These results suggest that the factor structure and internal consistency reliability scores of the KIDSCREEN-27 embedded within an online survey are comparable to those reported in the literature for the paper version.</p>

<p>In order to ensure the effectiveness of context-based proactive recommendations in influencing tourist behavior, it is important to understand the factors that drive tourists’ inclination to adopt push recommendations from mobile devices. A projective method was applied to tap into tourists’ opinions and feelings about their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s as intelligent agents, and how these influence their attitudes toward push recommendations they receive while experiencing tourist destinations. While <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s have a mediating role in the tourism experience, a paradox exists in which tourists recognize an enhancement in certain aspects of a travel experience and a reduction in others. Confidence toward proactive recommendations is largely rooted in perceived proactiveness, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, social ability and intelligence of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s, while perceived reactivity and control lead tourists to fear that they will lose control over their tourism experiences.

<p>The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> provides an easily accessible way to meet certain needs. Over-reliance on it leads to problematic use, which studies show can be predicted by psychological distress. Self-determination theory proposes that we all have the basic need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competency, and relatedness. This has been shown to explain the motivations behind problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use. This study hypothesizes that individuals who are psychologically disturbed because their basic needs are not being met are more vulnerable to becoming reliant on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> when they seek such needs satisfaction from online activities, and tests a model in which basic needs predict problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use, fully mediated by psychological distress. Problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use, psychological distress, and basic needs satisfaction were psychometrically measured in a sample of 229 Hong Kong University students and structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesized model. All indices showed the model has a good fit. Further, statistical testing supported a mediation effect for psychological distress between needs satisfaction and problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use. The results extend our understanding of the development and prevention of problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use based on the framework of self-determination theory. Psychological distress could be used as an early predictor, while preventing and treating problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use should emphasize the fulfillment of unmet needs.</p>

<p>Diverse characters have been recently used in fashion products for children. The degree to which parents accept children<code>s opinions or attitudes when they engage in dialogue may be connected with consumer socialization and affect the criteria for the evaluation of character fashion products. This study examined the effects of mothers</code> childrearing attitudes on consumer socialization and the evaluation criteria for character fashion products for children. A questionnaire was conducted via the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> on 310 mothers with children aged between four and twelve. The results of the study showed: First, childrearing attitudes were divided into four dimensions: hostility, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, acceptance, and control. Consumer socialization was divided into communication in regards to consumption, consumption control, and the awareness of social relations. The evaluation criteria for character fashion products for children were divided into educational/utilitarian values, emotional values, and social values. Second, mothers were divided into an acceptance group, a moderation group, and a hostility group based on childrearing attitudes. The group with hostile childrearing attitudes had control over their children`s consumption and were conscious of others in the process of consumption. The group with accepting childrearing attitudes considered educational/utilitarian values and emotional values when they purchased character fashion products for children. The group with hostile childrearing attitudes considered social values. Third, autonomous childrearing attitudes had the largest influence on communication in regards to consumption. Controlling childrearing attitudes had the largest influence on consumption control and the awareness of social relations. Controlling childrearing attitudes had the largest influence on social/utilitarian and emotional values; however hostile childrearing attitudes had the largest influence on social values.</p>

<p>This paper presents a system for realistic behavioral programming of virtual characters, based on personality and probabilistic automata. We describe personality by using the Five-Factor Model and achieve <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> through a goal-oriented approach. Each character perceives the surrounding world, decides how to behave and acts on the environment according to its personality and to its goals. The chief idea explored by the proposed approach is that personality has a probabilistic influence on behavior selection instead of a deterministic one. Different behavior sequences available to achieve a goal are modeled using probabilistic automata and making probability dependent on character personality. This leads to non-repetitive behaviors, whose evolution is not foreseeable. The paper first motivates the approach in the context of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>therapy. Then, it summarizes related work and illustrates in detail the proposed approach. Finally, it presents obtained results and discusses the main limitations of the implemented system.

To test this concept, a technological transfer test was included in a randomized controlled-intervention study aimed at the causal relationship between computer use and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of older adults. Older adults with and without exposure to computer training and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use and participants without interest in computers were administered this test.

<p>Previous studies on problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use have focused almost exclusively on the fact that presence of negative functioning, such as social anxiety, depressive symptoms, or loneliness, represents a risk factor for unhealthy use of the web. For this reason the aim of the present study was to investigate the association between psychological well-being dimensions and problematic use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> communicative services. In the current study 495 undergraduate students were recruited. The Italian adaptations of the Psychological Well-being Scales and the Generalized Problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> Use Scale 2 (GPIUS2) were used to assess psychological well-being dimensions and generalized problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use, respectively. Psychological well-being dimensions explained a significant portion of variance for the GPIUS2 total score levels, after controlling for sex, age, and occupational status. The levels of <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span>, Environmental Mastery, and Positive Relations with Others acted as significant negative predictors of the tendency to use the web for regulating negative feelings, compulsive use of the web, and the negative outcomes that can arise as a result. The overall findings of the present study provide preliminary evidence that low psychological well-being is associated with problematic use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> communicative services.</p>

<p>Deriving self-worth from romantic relationships (relationship contingency) may have implications for women’s sexual motives in relationships. Because relationship contingency enhances motivation to sustain relationships to maintain positive self-worth, relationship contingent women may engage in sex to maintain and enhance their relationships (relational sex motives). Using structural equation modeling on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> survey data from a convenience sample of 462 women in heterosexual and lesbian relationships, we found that greater relationship contingency predicted greater relational sex motives, which simultaneously predicted both sexual satisfaction and dissatisfaction via two distinct motivational states. Having sex to improve intimacy with one’s partner was associated with greater sexual satisfaction and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, while having sex to earn partner’s approval was associated with sexual dissatisfaction and inhibition. While some differences exist between lesbian and heterosexual relationships, relationship contingency had sexual costs and benefits, regardless of relationship type.</p>

The present research investigated the psychometric properties of a French adaptation of this scale to the sport setting in two studies. In Study 1, the French version of the PASSES (i.e., I’Echelle des Perceptions du Soutien a I’Autonomie en Sport; EPSAS) was adapted for sport and completed by 134 athletes. Results of an exploratory factor analysis revealed a unidimensional structure with factor loadings ranging from .63 to .85. Results also showed satisfactory internal consistency (qc = .91). In Study 2 (N = 203), a confirmatory factor analysis provided further support for the unidimensional structure of the questionnaire. Convergent validity of the instrument was also obtained through correlations with meaningful constructs, namely intrinsic motivation and identif…</p>

<p>Introduction The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> provides adolescents the chance to experience <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> through the collection of information and contact with peers with whom to share experiences, emotions and thoughts. A misuse of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> can occur if a teenager avoids real relationships and surfing the web turns into a psychological defense, in contrast with a healthy mental development. Objectives and Aims The research investigates forms and motivations of misuse of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> among a group of Italian teenagers. Objective of the work is the hypothesis of a correlation between massive use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and behaviours of social retreat. Methods The research used a questionnaire. The areas of investigation were: school performance, hours of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> surfing, activity on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> (social networks, games, information research, gambling online), psychological reasons of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use, behaviours of social retreat. 583 adolescents (45% males and 54% females, mean age 17 years) responded to the questionnaire. Results The 6% of adolescents sample responded to always think the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> even when not on the computer or gets irritated and reacts impulsively if someone bothers him while it is connected. The 5% prefer surfing rather then going out with friends. Hours of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> sulfing and responses of social retreat were correlated. Conclusions The social retreat can be one of consequences of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> misuse, with difficulties in socializing and use of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> as a psychological defense.</p>

<p>Schools are often encouraged to facilitate extra-curricular learning within their own premises. This study addresses the potential of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s (SNS) for supporting such out-of-class study. Given concerns that learning on these sites may happen at a surface level, we adopted self-determination theory for designing a social networking experience that aspired to offer a ‘community of inquiry’. A case study of a Mandarin class is reported, in which seven children voluntarily attended afterschool lessons and used a SNS for 12 weeks. Pedagogical strategies to create a sense of relatedness and competence and to offer <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support were used in order to steer their informal communication and exploration towards deep and meaningful learning. Our findings show that the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online social network</span>ing activities are not used simply to extend formal lessons to informal online environment, instead they open up opportunities for students to benefit from informal exploration and thus enrich their experience o…</p>

<p>This article reports on a study of the relationship between expressive individualism, an important characteristic of individualistic cultures, and different varieties of prayer. Four dimensions of expressive individualism (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, setting oneself apart from others, personal development, and the expression of emotions) and four types of prayer (petitionary, religious, meditative, and psychological) were distinguished. Data were collected from participants in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> forums on Christian religiosity (N = 158); they were asked to complete questionnaires about expressive individualism and prayer. The relationship between expressive individualism and prayer was found to be an ambivalent one, and one that is negatively dominated by <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. After eliminating the effect of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, two patterns remain visible, both of them characterised by a positive connection to religiosity.

<p>Background: <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> interventions for improving health and well-being have the potential to reach many people and fill gaps in service provision. Serious gaming interfaces provide opportunities to optimize user adherence and impact. Health interventions based in theory and evidence and tailored to psychological constructs have been found to be more effective to promote behavior change. Defining the design elements which engage users and help them to meet their goals can contribute to better informed serious games. Objective: To elucidate design elements important in SPARX, a serious game for adolescents with depression, from a user-centered perspective. Methods: We proposed a model based on an established theory of health behavior change and practical features of serious game design to organize ideas and rationale. We analyzed data from 5 studies comprising a total of 22 focus groups and 66 semistructured interviews conducted with youth and families in New Zealand and Australia who had viewed or used SPARX. User perceptions of the game were applied to this framework. Results: A coherent framework was established using the three constructs of self-determination theory (SDT), <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness, to organize user perceptions and design elements within four areas important in design: computer game, accessibility, working alliance, and learning in immersion. User perceptions mapped well to the framework, which may assist developers in understanding the context of user needs. By mapping these elements against the constructs of SDT, we were able to propose a sound theoretical base for the model. Conclusions: This study’s method allowed for the articulation of design elements in a serious game from a user-centered perspective within a coherent overarching framework. The framework can be used to deliberately incorporate serious game design elements that support a user’s sense of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness, key constructs which have been found to mediate motivation at all stages of the change process. The resulting model introduces promising avenues for future exploration. Involving users in program design remains an imperative if serious games are to be fit for purpose.</p>

<p>Background: This study used the Self-determination theory to explore whether basic psychological needs satisfaction (BPN) has a protective role against unhealthy <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> use. Methods: The sample of 237 (75% women) first year university students completed questionnaires on generalized problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> use (GPIU), perceived stress (PS) and BPN (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, relatedness) on two occasions over a one year period. Linear regression models were built to explore the relationship between PS, BPN and GPIU as well as to test the potential moderating role of BPN. Findings: The BPN relatedness at T2 was negatively associated with GPIU (?=-0.156; p?0.05). Further, PS at the baseline and its increase during the year served as significant predictors of GPIU at T2 (?=0.310 p?0.001; ?=0.153 p?0.05). However, evidence for the moderating effect of BSN was not detected. Discussion: In line with the assumptions, PS and low satisfaction with relationships was found to be directly related to GPIU although further research is needed to identify moderating protective factors.</p>

<p>While intrinsic motivation has received broad attention in recent entertainment research, the effects of extrinsic motivation, such as social pressure to use media, on media enjoyment remain unknown. Based on an online-survey (N = 230), this study tested the effects of intrinsic need satisfaction and perceived social pressure on the enjoyment of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> use with structural equation modeling. The results reveal complex effects of extrinsic motivation: While social pressure negatively affected <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> need satisfaction, it was positively related to competence and relatedness need satisfaction. This study is the first to develop and test a theoretical model of entertainment experience in the context of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use and to theoretically integrate the role of extrinsic need satisfaction in media enjoyment.</p>

<p>Display Omitted <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> higher in <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, relatedness and competence than f2f.The 2 groups differ in learning outcomes.The differences in learning outcomes relate to relatedness, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and competence.Within the groups no relations between learning outcomes and SDT variables.Relatedness is the strongest predictor of learning, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> the weakest. This article aims to explain differences between a group learning English on a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> page and a face-to-face group in terms of Self-Determination Theory (SDT). SDT focuses on three main variables, which improve self-determination and motivation outside but also inside the classroom: <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence and relatedness. The main research question was: how can we explain differences between a face-to-face group (FTF) and a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> group learning a foreign language in terms of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence and relatedness? The results indicate that there was a significant difference between the two groups in terms of learning outcomes as well as in the three SDT variables. Students in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> group felt more autonomous, competent and related. All three SDT variables correlated with learning outcomes. There was, however, almost no relationship among the SDT variables with learning outcomes within the two groups. The strongest predictor of the difference in learning outcomes proved to be relatedness, followed by competence.</p>

<p>Research suggests that personality dictates specific <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> preferences. One area that remains relatively unexplored is the influence of personality on engagement with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s SNSs. The current study employs a ‘Uses and Gratifications’ framework to investigate whether personality, age, and sex predict motivations for using SNSs. The study explores both global and specific factors of personality using Eysenck’s EPQ-R short form extraversion, neuroticism and psychoticism and Beck’s SAS sociotropy and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Principal component analysis identified ten distinct motivational components, which were then successfully predicted by individual differences through regression analyses. It is therefore suggested that individuals with different profiles vary in their motivations for using SNSs. Results support theoretical assumptions based on previous literature and personality dispositions.</p>

<p>This study examined associations between characteristics of teenagers’ relationships with their mothers and their later socializing behavior and peer relationship quality online. At age 13, teenagers and their mothers participated in an interaction in which mothers’ and adolescents’ behavior undermining <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and relatedness was observed, and indicators of teens’ depressive symptoms and social anxiety were assessed. At age 20, youth self-reported on their online behaviors, youths’ social networking webpages were observationally coded to assess peer relationship quality online, and symptoms of depression and social anxiety were reassessed. Results suggested that problematic mother-teen relationships were predictive of youths’ later preference for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communication</span> and greater likelihood of forming a friendship with someone met online, yet poorer quality in online relationships. Findings are discussed within a developmental framework suggesting the importance of considering youths’ family interactions during early adolescence as predictors of future online socializing behavior and online interactions with peers.</p>

<p>The aim of this study was to assess a modified version of the trans-contextual model (Hagger, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Chat</span>zisarantis, Culverhouse, &amp; Biddle, 2003) based on self-determination theory (Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985) and the theory of planned behaviour (Ajzen, 1985). The modified version included two additional components: use of learning strategies and positive general feedback. It was hypothesized that students’ perceptions of how they use learning strategies taught by their physical education (PE) teachers and perceived positive general feedback would influence students’ intrinsic motivation, intentions, and physical activity behaviour in a leisure-time context through intrinsic motivation in PE. A structural equation model supported the hypotheses and demonstrated that the use of learning strategies and perceived positive general feedback in PE indirectly influenced intrinsic motivation in leisure time through the effect of intrinsic motivation in PE. There was a direct effect of perceived positive general feedback on physical activity behaviour as well as an indirect effect through the motivational sequence.</p>

<p>The prevalence of depression is high and results in huge costs for society. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>-based cognitive behavioural treatment (ICBT) has been suggested for use in primary care and has been shown to be more effective when combined with human support. However, non-completion rates remain a challenge. Current recommendations state that steps to improve persistence with ICBT should be determined and the impact of therapist support on persistence explored. A few earlier studies have explored motivations to persist with ICBT without face-to-face therapist support. The present study explored the motivation to persist as experienced by a group of patients who sought help in primary care and used “blended care”, i.e.&nbsp;ICBT supported by short face-to-face consultations. To elucidate motivation in an everyday context and the meaning of patients’ experiences we chose a phenomenological hermeneutical approach. We interviewed participants in the intervention group of a randomized controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy of an ICBT programme called MoodGYM, an eHealth intervention used to treat depression. Fourteen participants, both completers and non-completers, went through individual, semi-structured interviews after they ended their treatment. Hope of recovery and a desire to gain control of one’s life were identified as intrinsic motivators. The feeling of being able to freely choose how, when and where to complete the ICBT modules was identified as an important supporting condition and satisfied the participants’ need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Furthermore, the importance of a sense of belonging towards partners, friends or family was essential for motivation as was the ability to identify with ICBT content. Another supporting condition was the experience of connectedness when met with acknowledgement, flexibility and feedback from a qualified therapist in the face-to-face consultations. A key finding was that participants were motivated to persist with ICBT when their overall need for relatedness was satisfied. This was achieved through a sense of belonging towards partners, friends and family. Connectedness with the therapist and the participant’s ability to identify with the ICBT modules also gave a sense of relatedness. Improving these motivational aspects may increase patients’ persistence with ICBT.</p>

<p>The quality of life of older adults may be improved by the use of computer or Web-based services. A limited number of experimental studies on this topic have shown mixed results. We carried out a randomized, controlled intervention study that aimed to examine the causal relationship between computer use and measures of physical well-being, social well-being, emotional well-being, development and activity, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. We randomly assigned a group of 191 participants to an intervention group, a training-no intervention group, or a no training-no intervention group. A fourth group consisted of 45 participants with no interest in computer use. We collected data at baseline, after 4 months, and after 12 months. The results showed that using computers and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> neither positively nor negatively influenced everyday functioning, well-being and mood, and the social network of healthy older individuals. We discuss possibilities for future studies.</p>

<p>As <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> grow in popularity, more and more people produce user-generated content (UGC) in various types of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. Thus, practitioners are interested in how to support people’s motivation to produce UGC. While previous literature has examined various factors influencing people’s motivation to produce UGC, few studies have examined the role of other participants as well as the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> sites. Based on self-determination theory, our study examines the relationship between content attractiveness, trust, perceived competence and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, individual differences, and motivation to produce UGC. Using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social network site</span>s as the context of our study, we tested our hypotheses with U.S. college students, and the results supported our hypotheses. We contribute to the current literature by demonstrating that, when individuals perceive that other participants enjoy their UGC and trust <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> sites, the individuals’ perceived competence and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> are enhanced, which in turn supports their motivation to produce UGC.</p>

<p>Pro-social behaviors have been associated with enhanced well-being, but what psychological mechanisms explain this connection? Some theories suggest that beneficence-the sense of being able to give-inherently improves well-being, whereas evidence from self-determination theory (Weinstein &amp; Ryan, 2010) shows that increases in well-being are mediated by satisfaction of innate psychological needs for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness. Here we simultaneously assess these two explanations. Study 1 (N = 335) used a cross-sectional survey with an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> sample to develop a measure to assess beneficence satisfaction. The next two cross-sectional <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>-sample studies tested mediators between pro-social behavior and general well-being (Study 2, N = 332) and situational peak moment well-being (Study 3, N = 180). A fourth study (N = 85) used a diary method with university students to assess daily fluctuations in well-being associated with needs and beneficence. It was shown across all studies that both the three psychological needs and beneficence satisfaction mediate the relations between pro-social actions and well-being, with all four factors emerging as independent predictors. Together, these studies underscore the role of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness in explaining the well-being benefits of benevolence, and they also point to the independent role of beneficence as a source of human wellness.</p>

<p>The purpose of this study was to test the structural and criterion validity of scores derived from the Relatedness to Others in Physical Activity Scale (ROPAS). The participants (n1 = 893; n2 = 522) completed the ROPAS in addition to demographic questions (study 1) and well-being indicators (study 2) using cross-sectional, nonexperimental surveys. Confirmatory factor analysis (study 1) supported the tenability of a 6-item ROPAS measurement model that was invariant across gender. Higher ROPAS scores were associated with greater perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and competence and greater well-being (study 2). Overall, these findings suggested the ROPAS displays a number of psychometric properties that render the instrument useful for investigating issues of belonging and connectedness with others in global physical activity settings. jabr_ 61..87 Self-determination theory (SDT; Deci &amp; Ryan, 2002) has become a popular framework for understanding motivational issues in physical activity contexts such as sport and exercise (Hagger &amp; <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Chat</span>zisarantis, 2007). This is not surprising given the macro-level approach taken within SDT that specifies the nature and function of human motivation as well as the conditions that facilitate (or thwart) motivational development and enhance well-being (Deci &amp; Ryan). The approach embraced within SDT centers around an “organismic-dialectic” (Deci &amp; Ryan, p.&nbsp;5), which assumes that humans are active growth-orientated organisms who seek out opportunities for assimilation within their social world. The development of human potentials central to SDT does not occur in a social vacuum but relies on ambient supports that interface with the organism’s innate tendencies to optimize motivation and promote greater well-being (Deci &amp; Ryan). The concept of basic psychological needs is central to Deci and Ryan’s (2002) meta-theory and is formally explicated within Basic Psychological Needs Theory (BPNT). Deci and Ryan extolled the importance of feeling competent,</p>

An Interpretive Study from the Consumers’ Perspective Jyvaskyla: University of Jyvaskyla, 2010, 186 p.&nbsp;(Jyvaskyla Studies in Business and Economics ISSN 1457-1986; 97) ISBN 978-951-39-4077-5 (PDF), 978-951-39-4073-7 (nid.) Diss. Finnish summary The purpose of this interpretive study was to investigate how consumers participate in co-creation of value in advertising and what the dimensions of value were. The motivation arose from the growing centrality of consumers as “production partners”; the growing centrality of advertising value; the growth of experiential and visual consumption; and the growth of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. Advertising was conceived as experiential media products to be consumed. Empirical material consisted of consumer focus group discussions and interviews about advertising. The study involved 31 females. The empirical material was first categorized by qualitative content analysis following which it was analyzed using hermeneutical interpretation. The theoretical constructs of the consumer co-production model and aspects of consumer value provided the basis for interpretation. The consumers engaged in the co-production process in three different ways and experienced value in several ways. The first type was mixing, matching and blending in window-shopping, highlighting as value the females’ sense of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>: a feeling of independence and freedom of choice and a feeling of being up-to-date. Second, the goal-oriented journey generated: a feeling of empowerment; learning experiences; an increase in consumers’ cumulative product knowledge; and economic value. The third type was daydreaming and fantasizing that elicited feelings such as excitement, fun and pleasure as value. As the theoretical contribution a refined model of consumer co-production process in advertising is proposed. The model constitutes a new consumercentred, hierarchy-free model of advertising. Value is the consumer’s subjective experience based on the experience of co-creation itself and the consumer’s customized meanings of advertising. The practical implications were also proposed.</p>

<p>The aim of this study was to explore the effect of the Active Teen Leaders Avoiding Screen-time (ATLAS) intervention on psychological well-being in adolescent boys and to examine the potential mediating mechanisms that might explain this effect.ATLAS was evaluated using a cluster randomized controlled trial in 14 secondary schools located in low-income communities (N = 361 adolescent boys, mean age = 12.7 ± .5 years). The 20-week intervention was guided by self-determination theory and involved: professional development for teachers, provision of fitness equipment to schools, enhanced school sport sessions, researcher-led seminars, a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> application, and parental strategies for reducing screen time. Assessments were conducted at baseline and immediately post intervention (8 months). Psychological well-being was measured using the Flourishing Scale. Motivational regulations (intrinsic, identified, introjected, controlled, and amotivation) and basic psychological needs (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness) in school sport, muscular fitness, resistance training skill competency, and recreational screen time were examined as potential mediating mechanisms of the intervention effect.The intervention effect on well-being was small but statistically significant. Within a multiple mediator model, changes in <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> needs satisfaction, recreational screen time, and muscular fitness significantly mediated the effect of the intervention on psychological well-being.In addition to the physical health benefits, targeted physical activity programs for adolescent boys may have utility for mental health promotion through the mechanisms of increasing <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support and muscular fitness and reducing screen time.</p>

<p>Objective To analyze the influence of the bioethical reference point on the doctor-patient relationship, the effects of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> on this <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and the importance of the relationship vis-a-vis technological advance.Method A study with a descriptive and exploratory technique, utilizing a quantitative and qualitative approach.Findings Ten per cent consider the appearance of the reference point of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to be the most important factor in the changes in the relationship; 96% consider the introduction of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> important or very important, making the relationship more complex (84%); and 77% consider that it has been a great advance for the patient. Fifty-six per cent affirmed that the patient takes information obtained on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> to the doctor’s office, 85% that this attitude increases the patient’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and 32.2% that it interferes with the doctor’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.Conclusion The bioethical reference point of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> was a great advance for the patient and has made the relationship more complex; the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> increases the patient’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and may improve the relationship and increase his or her participation in decision making.</p>

<p>Abstract Automatic monitoring of user-generated content on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s (SNSs) aims at detecting potential harm for adolescents by means of text and image mining techniques and subsequent actions by the providers (e.g.&nbsp;blocking users, legal action). Evidently, current research is primarily focused on its technological development. However, involving adolescents’ voices regarding the desirability of this monitoring is important; particularly because automatic monitoring might invade adolescents’ privacy and freedom, and consequently evoke reactance. In this study, fourteen focus groups were conducted with adolescents (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;66) between 12 and 18&nbsp;years old. The goal was to obtain insights into adolescents’ opinions on desirability and priorities for automatically detecting harmful content on SNSs. Opinions reflect the contention between a need for protection online versus the preservation of freedom. Most adolescents in this study are in favour of automatic monitoring for situations they perceive as uncontrollable or that they cannot solve themselves. Clear priorities for detection must be set in order to ensure the privacy and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of adolescents. Moreover, monitoring actions aiming at the prevention of harm are required.</p>

<p>Due to the progress in information technology, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-bullying is becoming one of the most common forms of interpersonal harm, especially among teenagers. The present study (N = 548) aimed to investigate the relation between perceived parenting style (in terms of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support and psychological control) and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-bullying in adolescence. Thereby, the study tested for the intervening role of adolescent need satisfaction (i.e., <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and relatedness), empathic concern towards others, and adolescents’ recognition of full humanness to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-bullying offenders and victims. Findings revealed both a direct and an indirect relation between parenting and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-bullying. More specifically, parental psychological control directly predicted <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-bullying, whereas parental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support related to less <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-bullying indirectly, as it was associated with the satisfaction of adolescents’ need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, which predicted more empathic concern towards others, which in turn differentially related to recognition of humanness to victims and bullies. The discussion focuses on the implications of the current findings.</p>

<p>The author presents a study of the relationship between expressive individualism and religiosity. Data were collected from participants in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> forums concerned with New Age and Christian religiosity (N=422). Through factor analysis, four dimensions of expressive individualism were identified: <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, setting oneself apart from others, personal development, and expression of emotions. The relationship between expressive individualism and religion was found to be ambivalent and negatively dominated by <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. After eliminating the effect of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, two patterns remained visible, both characterized by a positive connection to religiosity. Setting oneself apart from others is associated with more traditional and institutional religiosity, and personal development with a more private mode of religiosity. The explanation of this concealed longing for religion is sought in the pressure resulting from expressive individualism as a way of life.</p>

<p>SNS is developing rapidly along with diffusion of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>. However as useage of SNS became excessive, SNS addiction became a social problem. Meanwhile the problem that users leavning SNS because of negative perceptions about SNS became issue. As both SNS addiction and continuance are important when using SNS, this study examines factors affecting <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> addiction and continuance. We derive three personal traits, which is <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, relatedness as variables that affect <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> addiction and continuance to use <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>.

<p>The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> can be a tool to promote adolescent development.The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> promotes identity formation primarily as a tool to develop interests and expertise.The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> promotes <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> by providing a private space, and a way for adolescents to negotiate and test parental rules.Teens use the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> to form and maintain friendships, but less often to form romantic relationships. This study explored adolescents’ opinions about how <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use supports the achievement of their developmental tasks. Qualitative data were collected in focus groups interviews with 127 Italian <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> users (11-20) attending middle and high schools. Discussions were recorded, transcribed and analyzed using content analysis. Results showed that the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> plays important functions in identity formation, personal <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and relationships outside the family. It allows teens to develop their own interests, to identify with others and, at the same time, differentiate from others. The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> is also an arena in which adolescents develop and practice <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> can be a source of conflict with parents, because of parents’ concerns about <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use. However, the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> can also be a meeting ground with parents. Finally, participants indicated the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> is used to form close relationships with peers. Gender and age differences are discussed. Although the study is cross-sectional and relies only on adolescent report, findings illustrate how the conceptual framework of developmental goals may be helpful for understanding how the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> can affect adolescents’ lives.</p>

<p>Perception of the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and relatedness of the self may be influenced by one’s experiences and social expectations within a particular cultural setting. The present research examined the role of culture and the Autonomous-Related self-construal in predicting for different aspects of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social Networking Site</span>s (SNS) usage in three Asian countries, especially focusing on those aspects serving interpersonal goals. Participants in this cross-cultural study included 305 university students from Malaysia (n = 105), South Korea (n = 113), and China (n = 87). The study explored specific social and interpersonal behaviors on SNS, such as browsing the contacts’ profiles, checking for updates, and improving contact with SNS contacts, as well as the intensity of SNS use, hypothesizing that those with high intensity of use in the Asian context may be doing so to achieve the social goal of maintaining contact and keeping updated with friends. Two scales measuring activities on other users’ profiles and contact with friends’ profiles were developed and validated. As predicted, some cross-cultural differences were found. Koreans were more likely to use SNS to increase contact but tended to spend less time browsing contacts’ profiles than the Malaysians and Chinese. The intensity of SNS use differed between the countries as well, where Malaysians reported higher intensity than Koreans and Chinese. Consistent with study predictions, Koreans were found with the highest Autonomous-Related self-construal scores. The Autonomous-Related self-construal predicted SNS intensity. The findings suggest that cultural contexts, along with the way the self is construed in different cultures, may encourage different types of SNS usage. The authors discuss study implications and suggest future research directions.</p>

Fifth, character study deflects attention from the unity of the total work to see the part as larger than the whole. For example, a character study might take into account Hamlet the prince rather than Hamlet the play. Sixth, character study tends to deny the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the created artifact and confuse real emotions with aesthetic emotions.’ Finally, many authors discourage character study by propagating the attitude that literary characters are mysterious gifts given them from some unknown source. All of these criticisms might be divided into two categories. The idea that reading a work of literature is only an aesthetic experience and should never be confused with an emotional experience is expressed in the first and sixth reasons given for avoiding character study. The other five criticisms of character study have to do generally with the idea that at its best character study is good description which nonetheless does not fulfill the critical task, or that, at its worst, it attempts to be analytical but fails because it does not bridge the gap between character itself and the relation of character to the work as a whole and to the reading experience. From a psychological perspective, character is not separate from the work as a whole. Rather, character is intricately and necessarily woven into the texture of a work. Thus, character expresses and is expressive of style, content, themes, imagery and ultimately is the purveyor of the intellectual and emotional rhythms of the author’s vision. From this viewpoint, character becomes a viable and even necessary focus for serious literary criticism and teaching. Character, seen as the driving force in fiction, as the purveyor of intellectual and emotional rhythms in the work, thus typifies the mimetic view of literature which sees no final discontinuity between a reader’s responses to art and to life. Within a mimetic perspective, a reader does not merely have a reading experience; he is the reading experience and the work becomes the reader’s experience of it. 9 ’ W. J. Harvey, Character and the Novel (London: <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Chat</span>to and Windus, 1965), p.&nbsp;206. ’9To further clarify the mimetic view of the reading experience, it is worthwhile to cite a comment made about the ideas of existential psychologist, Harry S. Sullivan: What we are asked to accept [by Harry S. Sullivan] is that in quite a real sense the self [reader] is one’s personal relationships. We have tended in the past to suppose that we are self-contained individuals looking out from a tower in our own private castle from which we proceed on periodic excursions in order to satisfy physical, emotional and mental needs and desires. We assumed that our contacts with the world left us relatively untouched, the same person as before. In the opinion of Sullivan this is a complete fallacy.

<p>Knowledge and understanding is important to the quality of life and coping ability of adolescents with bronchial asthma. Adolescents are often difficult to recruit and retain in educational programmes; the aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a modern training programme for adolescents. The two-day training programme included question sessions about asthma, lectures, videos, demonstrations, searches on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>, counselling and group discussions. The evaluation was based on focus group interviews with 39 adolescents, 13 to 16 years of age, divided into 7 groups. Adolescents were motivated for learning via the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>. The group discussions inspired to confidence and openness about one’s own disease and medication.

<p>ABSTRACTThe motivation of user-generated content (UGC) is a vital issue for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> providers. This study investigates this issue using the self-determination theory (SDT). The SDT identifies three fundamental human psychological needs, namely the need for competence, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and relatedness. This study aims to answer the question of how the satisfaction of these needs motivates users to produce UGC and utilizes the multi-study model comparison approach. Two survey studies were conducted in China and the United States. The partial least squares (PLS) analyses confirmed that the SDT indeed explained UGC motivation significantly and that trust beliefs support people’s need for relatedness. Post hoc analyses showed that there were significant differences between Chinese and American culture. Those results make important contributions to theory and practice. For example, practitioners need to motivate users to produce UGC by supporting their psychological needs. Besides, different trust beliefs should …</p>

<p>Young adolescents and advertising on sociaal network games: the influence of parents and school on advertising literacy and behavioural intentions Young adolescents and advertising on sociaal network games: the influence of parents and school on advertising literacy and behavioural intentions This study focusses on young-adolescents’ advertising literacy on social network games (SNGs). More particularly, a model is tested in which parental mediation styles and attention to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> advertising at school are related to conceptual and attitudinal advertising literacy in SNG and in which both advertising literacies in turn are related to behavioral intentions. Data were collected among 780 respondents (aged 10-14 years). After showing participants a video compilation of SNG Habbo, a questionnaire was given to the respondents addressing the abovementioned aspects. Results confirmed that <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive restrictive mediation is positively associated with understanding selling intention, while <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive active mediation is positively associated with understanding persuasive intention. In addition, attention to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> advertising at school is related to children’s understanding of persuasive intent. Critical attitude towards SNG advertising is negatively related to pester intention and intention to buy, while understanding persuasive intent is associated with a higher score on both intentions.</p>

This study uses a goal hierarchy approach to deepen our understanding of the relationship between the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> and psychological well-being (PWB) in young adults. The study applies a mixed-method design that combines means-end analysis and regression analysis to examine data collected from laddering interviews with 161 <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> users. The means-end chain analysis provided knowledge of the hierarchical goal structure in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> (i.e., activitiesmediated goalsultimate goals). Regression analysis was used to identify the relationships between the ultimate goals of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> use (e.g., psychological stability, belongingness) and the dimensions of PWB (e.g., self-acceptance, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>). The findings explain the significant association of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> use with well-being and the dual outcomes of enjoyment (positive in SNS; negative in users lives).

The model was tested using a structural equation model. The results of structural equation modeling [χ2 (48, N = 441) = 489,69, p = .001, χ2/d.f = 3.98, CFI = .94, IFI = .94, TLI = .93, RMSEA = .08] marked that perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support from the teacher was positively relacionated with intrinsic motivation in physical education classes, which in turn was positively associated with intrinsic motivation in leisure time. Perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support from family and peers was positively associated with motivation in leisure time, which in turn positively associated with the attitude and control standards. While the intention to practice physical activity was positively associated with the main concepts of the theory of planned behavior.

<p>In most countries, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> is one of the top <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s among children and adolescents. Several studies have investigated the effect of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> dependency on individuals’ psychological well-being. However, inadequate studies have examined the impacts of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> in eudaimonic well-being. The current study explores how emotional dependence on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> relates to psychological well-being in eudaimonic approach. A total of 401, 13 to 16 yearsold who studied at an upper secondary school in Malaysia participated in this study. We expected a negative association between emotional dependence on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> and psychological wellbeing. The moderation effect of self-efficacy was examined in the current research. The results of structural equation modeling revealed that emotional dependence on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> negatively effects adolescents’ overall psychological well-being. The influence was more pronounced on <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, purpose in life, and positive relationship with others. The results also demonstrated that high self-efficacy did not reduce negative impacts of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> emotional dependence on adolescents’ psychological well-being.</p>

<p>Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of this paper is to explore the ways to encourage members in QQ knowledge-communication groups to persistently share knowledge in terms of contexts and autonomous motivations.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach</p>
<p>Based on self-determination theory, three important contextual factors of QQ knowledge-communication groups were selected as exogenous variables and three typical autonomous motivations as mediating variables to construct a knowledge-sharing model. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> questionnaire surveys and data collection were conducted to test proposed hypotheses by means of structural equation modeling with AMOS.</p>
<p>Findings</p>
<p>Reciprocity, learning, and altruism have significant positive influence on persistent sharing willingness, and the degree to which each factor influences persistent sharing willingness differs considerably. <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> support, perceived usefulness, and relatedness support have no significantly direct influence on persistent sharing willingness, but they indirectly influence the persistent sharing behaviors by the mediating effect of different autonomous motivations.</p>
<p>Originality/value</p>
<p>This study contributes theoretically and practically. First, the results suggest that a particular motivation in different contexts has a different degree of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. In addition, explanations are offered for the phenomenon that suggest that controlled motivations directly affect autonomous motivations. It was found that the contextual factors of competence support and relatedness support also have influence on different autonomous motivations, and hence encourage knowledge-sharing behaviors. Specific suggestions for QQ group managers and information seekers are proposed.</p>

<p>In times of demographic change, skill shortage and disruptive innovations, organizational knowledge management and innovative capacity are the key to a company’s success. But how can knowledge be retained with fast staff turnover, global project-based work and parental leaves? Using enterprise <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> to improve knowledge dissemination at work seems promising, when looking at the success of private <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s. In this article we combine ten different empirical studies which investigated different aspects of how user diversity influences the motivation to use <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> at work. The emerging meta-study using the DerSimonian—Laird method (total sample size <span class="math display">\[N=522\]</span>N=522) analyzes different aspects of user diversity and their correlation with eight motives for SNS usage: information, importance, contact, self-presentation, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, social comparison, and power and control. We found that that the individual achievement motivation correlates positively with the motives importance, power, information and self-presentation. The need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> correlates with openness to new experiences and the need for social comparison with gender and neuroticism. From our findings, we derive practical implications for designing a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span> for work which fulfills the users’ needs and functions along their motivation.</p>

<p>SYNOPSISObjective. Extant research examining the predictors and outcomes of parenting self-efficacy has predominantly focused on families with young children. Adolescence is a time of increased <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> during which parents may be uncertain about their abilities to influence their adolescents’ risk-taking behavior. Design. Parents’ (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;145 mothers and 53 fathers) confidence in their parenting abilities across prudential adolescent behaviors was investigated, including alcohol consumption, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> activities, eating behaviors, and problem peer associations. Additionally, we explored how adolescents’ (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;161, Mage&nbsp;=&nbsp;14.4&nbsp;years, 60% female) reports of their engagement in those behaviors were associated with parents’ perceptions of their ability to impact their adolescents’ behavior (i.e., self-efficacy). Results. Mixed-model analysis of variance revealed that mothers and fathers felt most efficacious in reducing their adolescents’ engagement in problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> activities and least efficacious regarding alc…</p>

<p><span style="background-color:lightgreen">Mobile Mess</span>aging Apps (MMAs) such as WhatsApp, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> Messenger, LINE, Signal or <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Snapchat</span> are used by many consumers next to the traditional electronic communication services (ECS) SMS <span style="background-color:lightgreen">texting</span> and phone calls. While with ECS the idea of full end-to-end interoperability is one of the key features, initial research (28 qualitative interviews) conducted by us indicate that consumers use different MMAs to negotiate their social ties. In this paper, we extend this research with an analysis of the functionalities of 139 MMAs and 20 in-depth interviews focusing on how consumers use individual services to manage stages of intimacy in relationships, communicate a message’s urgency, or craft social messages. We find that the technological seams between various MMAs indeed fulfil important functions as they enable consumers to mediate competence, relatedness and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> as defined in Deci and Ryan’s Self-Determination Theory (SDT). Furthermore, the paper shows how the choice of MMA reflects different stages of relationship development. Finally, we show that consumers also rely on technological seams between MMAs to feel autonomous and competent in their social interactions as the choice of MMA and functionality according to the specificities of the situation adheres to a finely grained social code. For policy makers and regulators, our results indicate that imposing interoperability obligations on MMAs is likely to reduce consumers’ well-being given the importance of technological seams to enact self-determination.</p>

<p>Abstract <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social media</span> environments can transform and reinforce life experiences, influencing self-concept and providing happiness. The goal of this research is to examine <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> networking as an experiential phenomenon, wherein consumers pursue virtual happiness by satisfying the self-determination theory (SDT) needs of relatedness, competence, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Beginning with the memory connection to self-concept, the study proposes an experiential outcome circle for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> to virtual happiness. A circle depicts the idea that self-concept motivates <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> behavior, which influences the self-concept. Happiness, or affect balance, is a potential outcome of this connection. The study analyzes n&nbsp;=&nbsp;504 <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> networking participants using generational cohorts with fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). This study suggests the metaphors for each generation based on the following SDT recipes: (1) “we” for generation Y with relatedness and competence, (2) “me” for generation X, with <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and competence, and (3) “be” for baby boomers with competence.</p>

<p>espanolSmart product, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Smartphone</span>, Product intelligence, Consumer innovativeness, Service adoption EnglishThis paper investigates consumers’ perceptions toward smartness characteristics of smart phones to understand the influence of product smartness on consumer satisfaction. Recent developments in information technology are accelerating the pace of change in products, particularly the emergence of smart products. Despite these technological advances, however, there is a lack of understanding about consumers who buy and use smart products. In this empirical study, five smartness dimensions of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, adaptability, reactivity, multifunctionality, and ability to cooperate, are used to examine perceived product smartness which is also tested with consumer satisfaction. Based on their experiences with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s, 388 consumers, in their 20s, respond to the questionnaire. Among the five factors, adaptability y and multi-functionality have significant influence on perceived product smartness and consumer satisfaction. However, the other three factors do not show a significant impact. In addition, the moderator effect of customer innovativeness on satisfaction has been proven significant. The results of this study provide a better understanding of the impact of product smartness on customer attitudes and provide managerial implications for new product development and market managemet.</p>

<p>Abstract Participation has become a buzz word in many an economic and social context. This however hides the fact that there is a great variety of different participative practices, both on micro and macro levels, practiced for very different purposes. Sometimes speaking of participation is just juggling with names. In many enterprises market driven work organisations offer “participation” to employees, which is in fact a device to misuse employees’ interest in “authentic participation” (Fals Borda, 2013/2007) for increasing the efficiency of work by dependent <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. In modern forms of so called interactive value creation via the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> we find another practice: so called participation of consumers or <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>ies of co-producers in designing, creating or improving (new) products. Even in trade unions the use and practice of participation is sometimes ambivalent. In order to distinguish authentic participation in the interest of participants from the misuse of participation for different interests (increase in efficiency; exploitation of participants’ creative capacities) this author coins the term of democratic participation, characterised by, among others, democratic dialogue between subjects (no othering business); collective reflection; giving a voice to all participants. Finally it is argued that the practice of democratic participation may open horizons of utopia. Keywords: authentic participation, democratic participation, participation on micro and macro levels, trade unions’ participative practices, inflationary use of the term participation</p>

<p>The present study aims to find out the effect of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> addiction on psychological wellbeing of adolescents studying in and around Mysuru city. A total of 720 adolescents were included in the present study, having equal number of male and female students studying in 10, 11 and 12th standards. They were administered <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction scale (Young, 1998) and Psychological wellbeing scale (Ryff, 1989). One way ANOVA was employed to find out the difference between normal, problematic and addict levels of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> on psychological wellbeing scores. Results revealed that as the levels of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> addiction increased, total psychological wellbeing scores decreased linearly and significantly. As the levels of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> addiction increased, wellbeing also decreased in specific components of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, environmental mastery, and purpose in life.</p>

<p>Prior research indicates that many people wish to limit aspects of their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use. Why is it that certain <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use feels so meaningless? We examined this question by using interviews, the experience sampling method, and mobile logging of 86,402 sessions of app use. One motivation for use (habitual use to pass the time) and two types of use (entertainment and passive <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>) were associated with a lower sense of meaningfulness. In interviews, participants reported feeling a loss of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> when using their phone in these ways. These reports were corroborated by experience sampling data showing that motivation to achieve a specific purpose declined over the course of app use, particularly for passive <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and entertainment usage. In interviews, participants pointed out that even when <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use itself was meaningless, it could sometimes still be meaningful in the context of broader life as a ‘micro escape’ from negative situations. We discuss implications for how mobile apps can be used and designed to reduce meaningless experiences.</p>

<p>Background: According to the Self-determination Theory, psychological need satisfaction and gaming motives are potentially salient factors of behavioural addictions such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> gaming disorder (IGD). This study examined the mediating role of gaming motives on in-game psychological need satisfaction (i.e., <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span>, Competence, and Relatedness) and IGD tendency. Methods: Chinese adult online gamers (N=383) were recruited and completed an online anonymous questionnaire survey. The questionnaire was composed of Player Experience of Need Satisfaction (for assessing In-game competence, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and relatedness), Motive for Online Gaming Questionnaire (for assessing General, Escape, Coping, Fantasy, Skill Development, Recreation, Competition, and Social motives), DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for IGD, and demographic items. With demographic items included as controlled variables, the path analysis using Mplus 7.4 was conducted to predict Rasch-scaled IGD tendency score from the DSM-5 criteria. Findings: In our path model, in-game need satisfaction was significantly related to gaming motives. For example, In-game relatedness was positively associated with Social (β=.43) and negatively related to Recreation and Competition (β = −.20 and −.17). All three types of need satisfaction were positively associated with General Motivation (β range= .23-.30). The significant, direct risk factors for IGD included male gender, In-game <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, General Motivation, and Escape motive (β range= .17-.26), while Skill Development and Recreation motives (β = −.16 and −.10) were protective factors. Discussion: Our findings suggested gaming motives mediating the effect of psychological need satisfaction on IGD tendency. Future intervention programs should also take specific psychological risk factors such as perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and Escape motive into account.</p>

<p>ABSTRACTThe current study examined the role of parental media mediation styles in the relationships between (1) pro<span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> content and the performance of prosocial behavior and (2) anti<span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> content and the performance of antisocial behavior. The results of a cross-sectional survey (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;475; Mage&nbsp;=&nbsp;14.6) indicated that <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive restrictive mediation was positively related to prosocial behavior through increased pro<span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> exposure, while it was also associated with less antisocial behavior through decreased anti<span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> content exposure. <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span>-supportive active mediation on the other hand strengthened the positive association between exposure to pro<span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> content and the performance of prosocial behavior. However, this type of mediation did not moderate the association between exposure to anti<span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> content and the performance of antisocial behavior. These results indicate that <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive mediation styles are most effective in managing media effects,…</p>

<p>Abstract Research has revealed that the push to engage in video games is in part the perception that they satisfy three basic psychological needs (competence, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, relatedness). However, the pull toward a problematic style of video game engagement based on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> Gaming Disorder symptomatology has been found to be explained in part by the daily frustration of these same needs. Currently, these two areas of gaming research have been conducted within separate studies. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to bridge these two theoretically compatible areas of research in exploring the interaction between gaming need satisfaction and daily need frustration in explaining problem video game use and gaming frequency. An online sample of 922 adults (59.1% males; Mage = 23.53 years; SD = 6.84) were recruited. Results revealed both gaming need satisfaction and daily need frustration positively contributed to gaming frequency and problem video game use accounting for 19.7% and 23.5% of their respective variances. Furthermore, gaming frequency and problem video game use were highest when both gaming need satisfaction and daily need frustration were high. The implications of these results are discussed within the context of current research and strengths-based clinical approaches.</p>

<p>When facing setbacks and obstacles, the dualistic model of passion outlines that obsessive passion, and not harmonious passion, will predict greater levels of defensiveness. Our aim was to determine whether these passion dimensions predicted defensiveness in the same way when confronted with threatening messages targeting the decision to pursue a passion.Across four studies with passionate <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> users, hockey fans, and runners (total N = 763), participants viewed messages giving reasons why their favorite activity should not be pursued. Participants either reported their desire to read the messages (Studies 1 and 2) or evaluated the messages after reading them (Studies 3 and 4).Harmonious passion consistently predicted higher levels of avoidance or negative evaluations of the messages. These responses were attenuated for participants who had previously affirmed an important value (Study 1), or who were told that they do not control the passions they pursue (Study 4).Harmonious passion entails a sense of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and control over activity engagement, which usually leads to nondefensive behavior. However, this sense of control may elicit more defensive responses from more harmoniously passionate individuals when the decision itself to pursue an activity is under attack.</p>

<p>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Background:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; With the increasing global population of older adults, there is a need for environmental interventions that directly affect their physical, psychological, and emotional well-being to help them maintain or regain their independence and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> – all of which promote longevity. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; To better understand potential opportunities and challenges associated with interior design and “future homes” that may promote well-being, aging in place, and independent living in older adults, the authors reviewed relevant literature and included their own expert opinions from a multidisciplinary point of view including interior design, wellness, and engineering. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; After summarizing existing environmental interventions for the aging population and their effectiveness, this review reveals knowledge gaps in interior design for the well-being and longevity of older adults followed by a discussion of opportunities for future research that may fill these gaps. Some of these opportunities include finding habilitative design strategies that identify and address unique situational needs of each user, advancing multidisciplinary fields such as environmental gerontology that recreate security and independence for older adults even outside of their homes, implementing technically advanced design strategies, which are flexible and adaptive to individual needs; and integrating the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of things (IoT) into living environments, including voice-activated command technologies to improve seniors’ central role in enabling an optimized healthcare ecosystem. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Knowledge of current evidence regarding the impact of different environmental factors may hasten adaptation of well-designed innovations that can provide optimal healing and living environments for the aging population. By effectively addressing older adults’ unique and specialized needs, design practitioners can become an indispensable part of their medical, social, and environmental team. One of the rapidly developing infrastructures promising to revolutionize the design of “future homes” is the IoT. While it is at an early stage of development, ultimately we envisage a connected home using voice-controlled technology and Bluetooth-radio-connected add-ons, to augment much of what home health does today. Bringing these approaches together into an effective strategy for a model of effective geriatric care is important and needs to become an integral part of both design education and practice.</p>

<p>A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted of the techniques used to promote psychological need satisfaction and motivation within health interventions based on self-determination theory (SDT; Ryan &amp; Deci, 2017. Self-determination theory: Basic psychological needs in motivation, development, and wellness. New York, NY: Guilford Press). Eight databases were searched from 1970 to 2017. Studies including a control group and reporting pre- and post-intervention ratings of SDT-related psycho<span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>tors (namely perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support, need satisfaction and motivation) with children or adults were included. Risk of bias was assessed using items from the Cochrane risk of bias tool. 2496 articles were identified of which 74 met inclusion criteria; 80% were RCTs or cluster RCTs. Techniques to promote need supportive environments were coded according to two established taxonomies (BCTv1 and MIT), and 21 SDT-specific techniques, and grouped into 18 SDT based strategies. Weighted mean effect sizes were computed using a random effects model; perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support g = 0.84, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> g = 0.81, competence g = 0.63, relatedness g = 0.28, and motivation g = 0.41. One-to-one interventions resulted in greater competence satisfaction than group-based (g = 0.96 vs.&nbsp;0.28), and competence satisfaction was greater for adults (g = 0.95) than children (g = 0.11). Meta-regression analysis showed that individual strategies had limited independent impact on outcomes, endorsing the suggestion that a need supportive environment requires the combination of multiple co-acting techniques.</p>

<p>Feasible and effective interventions to promote physical activity among vocational school-aged adolescents are strongly needed. Text messaging and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> are feasible and acceptable delivery modes for PA interventions among youth. However, little is known about the opinion of vocational school-aged adolescents regarding behavioural change techniques that can be applied through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> or text messaging. Therefore, our aim was to gain insight into the opinions of vocational school-aged adolescents towards the use of different behaviour change techniques and towards <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>/text messaging as a delivery mode for PA interventions. Six focus groups were conducted with 41 adolescents from the first grade (12-14 years) of secondary vocational schools in Flanders (Belgium). In total 41 adolescents participated and completed a questionnaire about their text messaging and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> use prior to group discussions. Focus group discussions were audio-recorded and analysed using a thematic analysis method in Nvivo. Participants thought that different behaviour change techniques (e.g., providing feedback, goal setting, self-monitoring, social comparison) could be integrated in a PA intervention using text messaging and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> and were enthusiastic about participating in such an intervention. They indicated that text messages are an easy way to receive information about PA, and that a group page on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> is ideal to share information with others. Participants deemed it very important that the group page on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> would only include peers with whom they also share an offline connection. Furthermore, adolescents stressed the importance of having <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (e.g., to determine their personal activity goals, to self-monitor their behaviour) and of being active together with friends. This qualitative study revealed that the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> and text messaging is promising as a delivery method for PA interventions among vocational school-aged adolescents. The adolescents were keen to participate in an intervention that integrates behaviour change techniques using text messaging or <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>.</p>

<p>The need for a better understanding of the risk factors underpinning disordered gaming has been consistently emphasized. Although, gaming may offer a simple and straightforward means of alleviating distress, relying on gaming to address one’s unmet psychological needs could invite problematic usage. Self-determination theory highlights the significance of three universally inherent psychological needs for relatedness, competency, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. A motivation to engage in gaming may be to address unmet needs and may become problematic.This study aimed to assess whether experienced levels of loneliness, depression and self-esteem mediate the association between <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> Gaming Disorder (IGD) behaviours and Need-Fulfilment deficits.The participants comprised of 149 adults (83 males, 66 females), aged between 18 and 62 years. A series of self-reported questionaries assessing their levels of IGD behaviours, depression, loneliness, self-esteem and need-fulfilment were completed.Need-fulfilment deficits were linked to higher IGD behaviours. Interestingly, this association was mediated by the reported levels of self-esteem and depression and not loneliness.The findings lend further empirical support for the mediating role of psychological distress between need fulfilment deficits and IGD behaviours.</p>

<p>Abstract Although increasing numbers of employees working in public organizations are using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> for work purposes and numerous studies exist on how <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> affect organizational outcomes, we have very limited knowledge of how using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> for work purposes affects employees’ work motivation. This paper fills this important gap by using self-determination theory (SDT) to analyze how the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> for work purposes is associated with government employees’ need satisfaction and intrinsic work motivation. According to regression results, employees’ use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> is positively related to employees’ need satisfaction (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, relatedness, and competence) and, accordingly, intrinsic work motivation. However, further analysis shows that too much use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> has an averse effect. Theoretically, this study is one of the pioneer attempts to integrate e-governance with SDT. Practically, we encourage managers to use caution in promoting the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> for work purposes. Using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> two to three days a week may be the ideal range.</p>

<p>Background: Self-determination theory, which deals with motivation and personality, comprises three factors of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence and relatedness that can be influenced by the features and potentials of social networks. Objectives We aimed to investigate the influence of social networks on the three main factors of the self-determination theory in learners. Methods: The present case-control study with a pretest-posttest design was conducted among 40 Iranian Ph.D.&nbsp;students who lived in Schengen area countries. Students were randomly divided into control (n = 20) and experimental (n = 20) groups. Before and after holding training sessions through a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> (<span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>) and face to face (FTF) education, Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and the intrinsic motivation inventory were used for data collection. The intrinsic motivation inventory is a valid instrument that evaluates the three factors of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence and relatedness. Results: the results indicated a significant difference between the two groups in terms of the three factors. The means of all the three variables improved significantly in the social network group as compared to the FTF group (P = 0.00). Although competence had improved in both groups, this improvement was greater in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> group relative to the FTF group (P = 0.00). Conclusions: Social networks provide better learning experiences. They improve learning outcomes as they boost learners’ relatedness, competence and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.</p>

<p>This reflection article discusses in a broader way the results of a research carried out by the authors that sought to find the relationship between family variables and variables of addiction in university students, such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction and the consumption of alcoholic beverages and psychoactive drugs. In the research, only a relationship was found with the presence of siblings and family typology, for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction. There was a broad search for references that, in general, confirm the relationship between family variables and addictive variables for Young students of secondary schools, but not for university students. As a result of this review, we hypothesize that, for young university students, family variables lose their importance in favor of other variables such as networks of friends, features of the young person at this stage of his or her development characterized by the search for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and differentiation, and even residential independence from the family. Finally, this background course allows us to state that addictive behavior is determined by individual and contextual factors that require a complex systemic approach and a perspective focused on coping strategies and resilient capacity, as personal variables.</p>

<p>Abstract We develop a mediation model to explain the relationship between attachment and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social Networking Site</span> (SNS) addiction. Drawing upon the Needs-Affordances-Features model, we investigate the mediating role of satisfaction of the innate psychological needs that are salient in the SNS context (i.e., need for relatedness, need for self-presentation, and need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>). Based on an empirical study of 314 daily <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> users, results reveal distinct effects of attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance on SNS addiction through the satisfaction of different psychological needs. Satisfaction of the need for relatedness and the need for self-presentation mediates the positive relationship between attachment anxiety and SNS addiction. Satisfaction of these needs also mediates the negative relationship between attachment avoidance and SNS addiction. Satisfaction of the need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> mediates the positive relationship between attachment avoidance and SNS addiction. We conclude the study with the implications for research and practice.</p>

<p>The current article addresses the issue of how to design for meaningful experiences of wellbeing and social inclusion, supported by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y, among older adults. This is done with regard to a background study conducted for the purpose of collecting end user needs in order to inform design choices. Our design approach is influenced by the theory of Experience Design, in which design should be aimed at creating specific experiences. These experiences are considered to derive from a limited number of fundamental human needs. The study is framed as design research using the methodology of user-centred design as a guide for the creative process. Semi-structured focus group interviews were conducted with 25 older adults, identifying needs of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, relatedness, physical thriving, security, pleasure and stimulation. Design goals were set based on these needs and three interventions were designed and implemented accordingly.</p>

<p>Abstract Applying psychological reactance theory (PRT) as a theoretical framework, this study investigates reactance-related factors to better understand why consumers avoid advertising on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>. An online survey was conducted to develop and empirically test a conceptual model that integrates the antecedents and outcomes of reactance against <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> newsfeed ads. Specifically, the study employs <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> users’ perceptions of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, freedom threat, and intrusiveness as antecedents of reactance and measures two sub-constructs of reactance: negative cognitions and anger. As the outcomes of reactance, two types of ad avoidance are examined: cognitive and behavioral. The major findings reveal that users’ perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> decreases their perceptions of ad intrusiveness. Subsequently, ad intrusiveness and freedom threat to use <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> have a positive effect on reactance, which influences ad avoidance. Theoretical and managerial implications are also discussed.</p>

<p>While many <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> users experience social pressure to be available, only some perceive this as a burden. It was hypothesized that this form of social pressure is especially detrimental when it reduces self-control and hinders need satisfaction. Study 1 experimentally tested whether the fulfillment of intrinsic needs (i.e., <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness) in mobile communication mediates these associations. Results show that social pressure negatively affected <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and competence, but did not influence relatedness. Repeated-measures data from Study 2 suggest that social pressure leads to self-control failure, which is associated with reduced competence. This research is the first to develop and test a theoretical model of the effects of social pressure to be available on self-control, need satisfaction, and individuals’ well-being.</p>

<p>Previous studies suggest that older adults are living increasingly alone and without the company of their close relatives, which cause them depression problems and a detriment to their health and general wellbeing. The use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social network site</span>s (SNS) allows them to reduce their isolation, improve their social participation, and increase their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Although the adoption of various information technologies by older adults has been studied, some assumptions still predominate, for example, that older adults use SNS only for utilitarian purposes. However, considering SNS as hedonic information systems, and in order to extend the theoretical explanation of the intention to use hedonic systems to their actual use, this study aims to determine the influence of perceived enjoyment, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use on the use of SNS by elders in Concepción, Chile. Two hundred fifty-three older adults participated in the cross-sectional study. The results indicate that perceived ease of use is the variable that has the greatest total effect in explaining the use of SNS and that by adding the perceived enjoyment construct, the explanatory power of the model increases significantly. Therefore, advancement in user acceptance models, especially in the use of SNS by elders, can be made by focusing on the type of system, hedonic or utilitarian.</p>

<p>The prevalence of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying among adolescents is globally on the rise. This study examined how general and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-specific parenting styles impact the prevalence of young adolescents’ involvement in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying as victims and/or perpetrators.One hundred and eighty 7th and 8th-grade Israeli students participated (Mean age = 13.25, SD = 0.81; 86 males, 89 females, 5 did not indicate gender). Adolescents reported the frequency of their involvement in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying, and whether their parents were using “<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive” or “psychologically controlling” strategies generally and specifically when mediating <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> use.A controlling parenting-style as well as an inconsistent <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>-mediation style were associated with a higher prevalence of adolescent involvement in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying as victims and as perpetrators. Prevalence was higher when parents who generally use a controlling style were less controlling or consistent when mediating <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> use.Despite the caveats related to parental control, parents who generally use a controlling style should consistently use this style while mediating <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>. Inconsistent parenting style conveys messages concerning <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> activities that contradict what teens are accustomed to receiving in other contexts. This inconsistency may encourage them to exploit their relative freedom in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> context and act irresponsibly.</p>

<p>Retailers are implementing technology-enabled mobile checkout processes in their stores to improve service quality, decrease labor costs and gain operational efficiency. These new checkout processes have increased customer convenience primarily by providing them <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in sales transactions in that store employee interventions play a reduced role. However, this <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> has the unintended consequence of altering the checks and balances inherent in a traditional employee-assisted checkout process. Retailers, already grappling with shoplifting, with an estimated annual cost of billions of dollars, fear that the problem may be exacerbated by mobile checkout and concomitant customer <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The purpose of this paper is to understand the effect of mobile checkout processes in retail stores on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>crime in the form of shoplifting enabled by a technology transformed the retail environment.,The authors conducted an online survey of a US sample recruited from a crowdsourced platform. The authors test a research model that aims to understand the factors that influence the intention to shoplift in three different mobile checkout settings − namely, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> checkout settings, store-provided mobile device checkout settings, and employee-assisted mobile checkout settings − and compare it with a traditional fixed location checkout setting.,The authors found that, in a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> checkout setting, intention to shoplift was driven by experiential beliefs and peer influence, and experiential beliefs and peer influence had a stronger effect for prospective shoplifters when compared to experienced shoplifters; in a store-provided mobile devices checkout setting, experiential beliefs had a negative effect on shoplifters’ intention to shoplift and the effect was weaker for prospective shoplifters when compared to experienced shoplifters. The results also indicated that in an employee-assisted mobile checkout setting, intention to shoplift was driven by experiential beliefs and peer influence, and experiential beliefs had a stronger effect for prospective shoplifters when compared to experienced shoplifters.,This study is the among the first, if not first, to examine shoplifters’ intention to shoplift in mobile checkout settings. We provide insights into how those who may not have considered shoplifting in less favorable criminogenic settings may change their behavior due to the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> provided by mobile checkout settings and also provide an understanding of the shoplifting intention for both prospective and experienced shoplifters in different mobile checkout settings.</p>

<p>The aim of this article is to review the empirical studies on the relationship between the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s use and subjective well-being of its users. Firstly, it has been pointed out that the outcomes of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s use depend on the type of usage (active or passive). Next, the studies attempting to explain why passive <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s use is related to reduced subjective well-being have been compiled, and specifically, the studies in which social comparisons and feeling of envy has been offered as an explanatory mechanism have been summarized. A need for researching about which emotions other than envy may potentially be triggered by the passive <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s use and how subjective well-being changes depending on those emotions has been brought forward. In addition, answers given to the questions of whether the relationships between the passive <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s use and the users’ emotions and subjective well-being depended on who have been contacted through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s were sought.</p>

<p>Prosocial violent media (e.g., media that combines both violent and prosocial content) is especially popular in entertainment media today. However, it remains unclear how parental media monitoring is associated with exposure to prosocial violent content and adolescent behavior. Accordingly, 1,193 adolescents were asked about parental media monitoring, media content exposure, and behavior. Main findings suggest that <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> supportive restrictive monitoring was associated with lower levels of exposure to prosocial violent content, but only among older adolescents. Additionally, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> supportive restrictive monitoring was the only form of parental media monitoring associated with lower levels of violent content and higher levels of prosocial content, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> supportive active monitoring was the only parental monitoring strategy that promoted prosocial behavior via exposure to pro<span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> content. Discussion focuses on the importance of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> supportive parental monitoring, as well as the implications of parents encouraging their children to watch media with limited violent content-even if it is prosocial violent content.</p>

<p>Purpose This research sheds light on behavioral change by demonstrating the transformative power of a brand on the process of eating behavioral change. The selected brand is Three Times a Day (a culinary blog whose mission is to encourage a healthier diet). This study aims to identify food-related behavioral changes as a result of consumers’ relationship with this brand and identify antecedents to such changes. Design/methodology/approach A netnography of the brand <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>y and 14 individual in-depth interviews were conducted. Findings Netnography results identify four categories of behavioral changes emerging from the relationship with the brand (e.g.&nbsp;choosing healthier/more varied foods, developing an interest in cooking and adopting a healthier lifestyle). Analysis of the individual interviews substantiate the role of brand attachment as a driver of positive change and identify three antecedents: brand-self connection (through past, actual and ideal self), brand exposure and satisfaction of individual needs (i.e.&nbsp;<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence and relatedness). Research limitations/implications Results enrich the literature on behavioral change and highlight the positive role of a brand in the context of improving eating habits. Findings extend the understanding of the consequences of attachment beyond its influence at the attitudinal level by focusing on concrete consumer behavior. Social implications It is recognized that despite good intentions, individuals keep making poor food choices. This important issue is associated with several diseases and increasing social costs. This research explores how to influence consumers in adopting better eating habits. Originality/value This study is one of the first to examine the power of a food-related brand to enhance positive eating practices and improve diet.</p>

<p>Based on the biopsychosocial model of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction, this study tested a moderated mediation model of familial (i.e., perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive parenting), psychological (i.e., need satisfaction) and biological (i.e., baseline respiratory sinus arrhythmia, RSA) factors to investigate how they jointly impact <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction in emerging adults; specifically, we explored whether RSA moderated the mediating effect of need satisfaction on the relation between perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive parenting and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction. A total of 146 Chinese undergraduates completed questionnaires on <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive parenting, need satisfaction and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction. RSA data were also obtained. Path analysis was used to test the proposed mediation and moderated mediation models. The results indicated that while the impact of perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive parenting on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction was mediated by need satisfaction, RSA moderated this indirect effect. The indirect effect of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive parenting on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction via need satisfaction was much stronger in adults with low levels of RSA than in those with high levels of RSA. Our findings highlight the joint impact of biological, psychological, and social-environmental factors on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction and have important implications for the prevention of and intervention against emerging adults’ <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction.</p>

<p>Abstract Previous work focusing on the relationship between <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use and quality of life among older adults (aged 65+) has found evidence of various positive impacts. This project expands upon this work by examining the relationship between <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use and measures of psychological well-being (PWB) including <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relations with others, purpose in life, and self-acceptance. The analytic sample is derived from two waves of data (Time 1 = 2004, Time 2 = 2011) taken from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study and includes a sample of older adults aged~65 at Time 1 (N = 4943). Participants were separated into four categories: those who did not use the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> at Time 1 or 2, those who used the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> at Time 1 only, those who used the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> at Time 2 only, and those who used the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> at both Time 1 and 2. Regression analyses were performed with the Time 2 PWB measures as the outcomes and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use categories as the primary predictors. Results indicate that while continuous <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> users typically reported higher PWB scores compared to non-users, those who stopped use between Time 1 and 2 also reported higher scores and those who started use between Time 1 and 2 reported lower scores. These results generally held when introducing Time 1 PWB measures as controls, suggesting changes in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use may affect PWB but not necessarily in the predicted directions. Additional control variables, potential explanations, and implications for future research are discussed.</p>

<p>Given the increasing popularity of online game playing, the negative impacts of game addiction on both adolescents and adults attracted our attention. Previous studies based on the self-determination theory have examined the effects of the three basic psychological needs of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness on problematic video game playing among Chinese young adults. Yet, as more evidence emerged pointing to the possible relation between need dissatisfaction and higher vulnerability for ill-being and psychopathology, the present study aimed to incorporate the impacts of both satisfaction and dissatisfaction for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness in explaining <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> gaming disorder (IGD), a condition that may in turn impede eudaimonic well-being as indicated by flourishing. In a self-administered online survey with a valid sample of 1200 Chinese young adults aged 18–24 years (mean age = 19.48 years), the prevalence of probable IGD (for those who reported five or more symptoms in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) symptom list for IGD) was 7.5%. Our results showed that relatedness dissatisfaction positively predicted IGD symptoms after controlling for other need satisfaction and dissatisfaction. Also, flourishing was found to be negatively predicted by IGD. Finally, IGD was found to mediate the effect of relatedness dissatisfaction on flourishing. Our findings suggested a risk factor of relatedness dissatisfaction in predicting IGD, thereby significantly predicting flourishing.</p>

<p>Co-construction theory suggests adolescents use digital communication to address developmental challenges. For a sample of 214 ethnically diverse adolescents, this research used direct observation to investigate the frequency, content, and timing of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">texting</span> with parents, peers, and romantic partners through grades 9-12. Analyses showed that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">texting</span> frequency follows a curvilinear trajectory, peaking in eleventh grade. Adolescents discussed a range of topics, predominantly with peers. Communication with parents was less frequent, but consistent over time. Approximately 45-65% of adolescents communicated with romantic partners, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">texting</span> heavily and about topics similar to those discussed with peers. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Texting</span> may help adolescents navigate key developmental challenges of adolescence-the establishment of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, intimate peer relationships, romantic relationships, and self-identity.</p>

<p>The article is based on the materials of foreign sources and discusses the current trends in the relationship of adolescents and their parents. The following problems are discussed: influence of upbringing styles and parental attitudes on various aspects of psychological development of adolescents; contribution of relationships with parents and peers into social and personality development in adolescence; peculiarities of teenagers’ attachments to parents; child-parent conflicts. The recent studies of family education and its influence on psychological development confirm the positive role of authoritative parenting style, the negative impact of rigid parenting style on adolescent aggression and so on. It is shown that excessive parental control does not contribute to the development of self-esteem and increases self-criticism in adolescent girls. In relatively new researches devoted to “technoference” the negative impact of technical means (phone, gadgets) on interaction between parents and children is shown. The article stresses the importance of attachment to parents in adolescence; the role of the quality of attachment in formation of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>; capacity to solve problems and cope with difficulties associated with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction; aggression and school performance. The article also presents studies of positive and negative aspects of the impact of conflict with parents on the personality development of adolescents, gender differences in behavior during the conflict between mother and father, the contribution of marital conflicts to psychological development in adolescence.</p>

<p>Customer-owned touch points have emerged as a central context for customers to consume, contribute, and create content while interacting with one another on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. Research on how firms’ attempts to intervene in such forums affect customers’ experience supremacy is still in its infancy. This study attempts to address this limitation, suggesting a framework for understanding firms’ impact on customer experience in customer-owned forums. Towards this aim, we adopt self-determination theory as a theoretical lens, and, empirically draw on interview material gleaned from customer-owned touch point users. The results show that companies’ attempt to control the discussions in such forums may have a negative impact on customers’ experiences when it undermines their sense of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, relatedness, and competence. However, firms’ intervention is welcome when the intention is to add value, enabling customers to retain or enhance their feeling of self-efficacy and social esteem.</p>

<p>Instances of anxiety, depression, and loneliness are attaining epidemic-levels among college-age students. Self-determination theory suggests that such feelings are attributable to antagonistic situations hindering the satisfaction of an individual’s basic needs for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness. Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) is a phenomenon that arose in the context of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use and refers to the need to stay continually connected. Studies have shown that problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and mobile technology use are related to feelings of anxiety, depression, and loneliness, and FOMO. Few studies have examined the relationships between these factors and academic performance. This study examines how Loneliness, FOMO, and the basic needs <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span>, Competence, and Relatedness, are related to Academic Performance. We find a positive influence of FOMO and a negative influence of <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> on Academic Performance. We discuss these and other findings.</p>

<p>Background: Behavioral addiction (BA) is a recent concept in psychiatry. Few studies have investigated the relationship between BA and early maladaptive schemas (EMSs). EMS is the core of Schema Therapy (ST). According to the ST model, psychiatric disorders result from the developmentof EMSs in response to unmet emotional needs in childhood. Bach and colleagues (2018) grouped the 18 EMSs in four domains: 1) disconnection and rejection; 2) impaired <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and performance; 3) excessive responsibility and standards; and 4) impaired limits. This study aims at assessing the possible association of the most frequent BAs with EMSs in a large group of late adolescents and young adults and to evaluate their self-perceived quality of life. Methods: A battery of psychological tests assessing food addiction (FA), gambling disorder (GD), <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> addiction (IA) and quality of life (QoL) was administered to 1,075 late adolescents and young adults (N=637; 59.3% women). A forward-stepwise logistic regression model was run to identify which variables were associated with behavioral addictions. Results: FA was more frequent among women and GD among men, while IA was equally distributed. Regarding the EMSs, participants with FA or IA showed significantly higher scores on all four-schema domains, whereas those with GD exhibited higher scores on impaired <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and performance and impaired limits. Besides, average scores of all domains increased with the association of 2 or more comorbid BAs. Self-perceived QoL was lower for participants with FA and IA, but not for those with GD; the presence of comorbid BAs was associated to lower PCS and MCS scores. Finally, specific EMS domains and demographic variables were associated with each BA. Conclusions: Late adolescents and young adults with FA or IA have a lower perception of their mental and physical health. The most striking result is that FA appears to be associated with the disconnection and rejection schema domain, IA with all the schema domains (except for impaired <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and performance), and GD with impaired <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and performance schema domain. In conclusion, our findings suggest that EMS should be systematically assessed during psychotherapy of patients with BAs.</p>

<p>The Interaction of Person-Affect-Cognition-Execution model (I-PACE; Brand, Young, Laier, Wolfling, &amp; Potenza, 2016) proposes that addictive behavior is the result of the interaction of multiple factors. According to I-PACE model, perceived social support (teacher <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support), self-esteem, and gratification (life satisfaction) contribute to adolescent <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use disorder (SUD) (Brand et al., 2016). However, previous studies have rarely examined the interactive effects of teacher <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support, self-esteem and life satisfaction on adolescent SUD. The present study examined these relationships using a moderated mediation model in which self-esteem played a mediating role and life satisfaction played a moderating role in the relation between teacher <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support and adolescent SUD. A sample of 1912 Chinese adolescents completed measures of teacher <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support, self-esteem, life satisfaction, and adolescent SUD. Self-esteem mediated the association between teacher <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support and adolescent SUD. In addition, the relation between teacher <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support and SUD was moderated by life satisfaction: when the effect of life satisfaction was high, teacher <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support negatively predicted adolescent SUD, whereas when the effect of life satisfaction was low, teacher <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support was positively related to adolescent SUD. These findings advance our understanding of the effect of teacher <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support, self-esteem and life satisfaction on adolescent SUD. Limitations and implications of this study are discussed, such as teacher <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support may not reduce adolescent SUD, especially when their life satisfaction is low.</p>

<p>Focusing on the configuration of the relationship between fate and freedom of action, this article analyses recent self-help literature and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>ies, particularly the genre that centres on the concept of resilience. The selected works and websites all address readers who suffer from depression, anxiety and stress. The article focuses on how the relationship between fate and freedom is represented in three literary figures: the reader, who is promised recovery; the narrator, who promises to save the reader from the mental illnesses; and the plot that the reader forms by his or her personal thoughts, feelings and experiences. Furthermore, fate and freedom will be analysed in a series of allegories and metaphors. We argue that each literary figure reflects a radical understanding of individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, that is, freedom of action. However, we also argue that each literary figure has a shadowy disadvantage, which activates a tragic reversal of fate. The article analyses how this self-help genre reflects a notion of tragedy in relation to mental suffering.</p>

<p>This study examined the relationship between Excessive <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> Use (EIU) in adolescents and their family environment, namely the family type, the family economic status, the effect of parental care, the level of parental control, the amount of parental monitoring, the quality of communication, and the time spent together. The study was based on data from an international survey, Health Behaviour in School Aged Children (HBSC), conducted in Slovakia. The sample representative for adolescents included 2547 participants (51% boys) aged 13–15. Multiple-step linear regression revealed that higher parental care and parental monitoring predicted lower EIU, while higher parental overprotection and lower socioeconomic status predicted higher EIU. The results suggest that both so-called optimal parenting (i.e., the balance of emotional warmth and protection) and the adolescent′s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> lower the risk of EIU. Family factors explained about 14% of the variance, which suggests that aside from personal, cognitive and affective factors, a close social environment also plays an important role in adolescence EIU.</p>

<p>The aim of this study is to increase evidence-based interventions by investigating the feasibility of an intervention using an interactive digital calendar with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> reminders (RemindMe) as support in everyday life. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from participating patients (n = 8) and occupational therapists (n = 7) from three rehabilitation clinics in Sweden. The intervention consisted of delivering the interactive digital calendar RemindMe, receiving an individualized introduction, a written manual, and individual weekly conversations for two months with follow-up assessments after two and four months. Feasibility areas of acceptability, demand, implementation, practicality, and integration were examined. Patients expressed their interest and intention to use RemindMe and reported a need for reminders and individualized support. By using reminders in activities in everyday life their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> was supported. The study also demonstrated the importance of confirming reminders and the possible role of habit-forming. Occupational therapists perceived the intervention to be useful at the rehabilitation clinics and the weekly support conversations enabled successful implementation. This study confirmed the importance of basing and tailoring the intervention to patients’ needs and thus being person-centered.</p>

<p>The relationship between self-control and media use is complicated. Loss of self-control capacity has been linked to generally higher levels of media use, which might represent self-regulatory failure, but could also be attempts at replenishing self-control. Indeed, self-determination theory proposes that satisfying intrinsic psychological needs (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness), for example via media use, aids the recovery of self-control. In this 2-wave survey (N = 395), we examined the interplay of users’ self-control capacity and their perceived satisfaction of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness needs via media use and alternative leisure activities. Satisfaction of intrinsic needs during leisure activities increased self-control capacity at the end of the evening. Feelings of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and competence during TV and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use, and competence during socializing, positively contributed to greater self-control. However, respondents with less self-control capacity before primetime experienced less intrinsic need satisfaction while engaged with TV, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, reading, sports, and socializing, diminishing self-control at bedtime.

<p>Gamification in education refers to the introduction of game elements in the design of learning processes. Our gamification approach was based on the self-determination theory. According to this theory, people need to have competence, social connectedness, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in order to feel determined to perform certain activities. We aimed to investigate the effects of teaching presence in online gamification on sustainability learning and self-determination as well as identify the driving factors and barriers to sustaining students’ participation in online gamified activity. A mobile application called JouleBug was used. It contains game elements and aims to encourage pro-environmental behaviours. Our quasi-experimental design included two university courses (as control and treatment groups) on sustainable education with 48 participants. Both groups worked with JouleBug, whereas the treatment group was also supported by their teacher’s teaching presence. To establish online teaching presence, the teacher shares the students’ leader board rankings, acknowledges the students’ achievements, and give comments and feedback on students’ activities in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>ting group twice a week. Sustainability knowledge and pro-environmental behaviour were measured through survey. Students’ performance in the gamified activities was measured through collected points in the JouleBug application. The drivers and barriers to sustaining the students’ participation in JouleBug activities were identified through focus group interviews and students’ reflection writing. We found there were significant differences in the sustainability knowledge, pro-environmental behaviour, and performance between the treatment and control groups. The Cohen’s d effect size value obtained for the treatment on sustainability knowledge, pro-environmental behaviour, and students’ performance indicates a large effect as well. Focus group interviews with the participants and the students’ reflection writings revealed that the driving factors in sustaining the participation in the gamified activities in the application are recognition by teachers and peers, competition, and sense of belonging to a group. Meanwhile, the barriers to sustaining participation in online gamification are time constraints, boredom caused by lack of social interaction, and boredom caused by activity repetition and activity’s inappropriate level of difficulty. The conclusion is the teacher plays a role as an agent in this online gamification learning context. The findings suggest that teaching presence is one of the important building blocks that encourage the students’ participation and learning in online gamification.</p>

<p>Marketers commonly seed information about products and brands through individuals believed to be influential on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, which often involves enlisting micro influencers, users who have accumulated thousands as opposed to millions of followers (i.e., other users who have subscribed to see that individual’s posts). Given an abundance of micro influencers to choose from, cues that help distinguish more versus less effective influencers on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> are of increasing interest to marketers. The authors identify one such cue: the number of users the prospective influencer is following. Using a combination of real-world data analysis and controlled lab experiments, they show that following fewer others, conditional on having a substantial number of followers, has a positive effect on a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> user’s perceived influence. Further, the authors find greater perceived influence impacts engagement with the content shared in terms of other users exhibiting more favorable attitudes toward it (i.e., likes) and a greater propensity to spread it (i.e., retweets). They identify a theoretically important mechanism underlying the effect: following fewer others conveys greater <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, a signal of influence in the eyes of others.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:lightgreen">Smartphone</span>s are omnipresent and offer real-time information on the go. Predominantly, adolescent girls have been found to be engaged in levels of physical activity (PA) below the daily recommended guideline of at least 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity, and especially during weekends. Lack of sufficient PA can lead to a risk of contracting non-communicable diseases. The purpose of this exploratory study was to investigate the efficacy of using mobile applications (app) (i.e.&nbsp;MapMyFitness [MMF]) in changing adolescent girls’ PA behaviour during weekends. It also examined the perceived benefits, challenges and recommendations for using mobile apps. Thirty-six participants aged 15 years ( M age = 14.9; SD = 0.30) from a convenience sample volunteered and took part in the present study, which spanned four weekends. Quantitative results showed a significant difference in the mean step count between experimental and control groups during week two, probably due to the novelty effect when the participants were introduced to the new MMF mobile app. Overall, the use of the MMF app seems to be able to attenuate the decline of adolescent girls’ PA level during weekends. Qualitative results revealed benefits of using mobile apps to promote PA, such as a sense of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in selecting PA, the ability to view friends’ postings of PA and self-monitoring of PA. The study revealed specific challenges to using such PA mobile apps - in particular, factors such as the cumbersome and confusing functions in the app that discouraged users from performing PA. Recommendations included allowing users to customise their accounts, simplifying the app’s functions, and including rewards and videos as motivators to enhance users’ PA experience. Although mobile apps may have the potential to encourage participation in PA, a careful selection of mobile app functions is required to engage adolescent girls to continue to use it for PA.</p>

<p>Background: Research has supported the cost-effectiveness of cognitive training tools enhanced by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICT) in several populations, including individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and age-related cognitive decline. The implementation of ICTs in this population, however, is sometimes challenging to their cognitive and age characteristics. Ultimately, this might compromise the effectiveness of ICT-enhanced therapies in this population. The aim of this study is to test the usability and acceptability of a European project prototype for elderly care, in an attempt to explore the ICT design needs of users with MCI. Methods: Participants were 28 individuals aged 58–95 years and with a diagnosis of MCI. Results: The results showed a low perception of peripheral elements and the need to place main interaction elements in the centre of the screen. The correlation between the general level of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (daily life activities) and the ICT <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> level was significant and positive. The speed of audio help had a significant impact on performance. Conclusion: The present work contributes to the literature on ICT usability needs of users with MCI. Some usability recommendations for designing interfaces for this type of user are provided in the text.</p>

<p>Psychological needs dissatisfaction has been identified as hindering adaptive development, in which <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> need dissatisfaction, as one core component, may be associated with adolescents’ maladaptive online behaviors. Sporadic research has examined the association between <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> need dissatisfaction and problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> use (PMPU). Boredom proneness and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> gaming were suggested to be linked to this association. This study aimed to examine the mediating effects of boredom proneness and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> gaming in the association between <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> need dissatisfaction and PMPU. A total of 358 secondary school students completed questionnaires at three waves; <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> need dissatisfaction was measured in time 1 (T1); boredom proneness and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> gaming were measured one year later (time 2, T2); PMPU was measured two years later (time 3, T3). The structural equation model results showed that T1 <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> need dissatisfaction not only directly predicted T3 PMPU, but also exerted effects via the mediating role of T2 boredom proneness and the chain mediating role of T2 boredom proneness and T2 <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> gaming. These findings reveal the unique role of specific psychological need in engaging PMPU, which provides support to targeted interventions, such that promoting <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> need satisfaction may be an instrumental procedure to prevent adolescents from addiction-like online behaviors.</p>

<p>We tested if challenges to basic psychological needs (BPN) for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness during the COVID-19 pandemic undermine people’s mental well-being. Furthermore, we tested if an intervention, affirmation of these psychological needs, enhances mental well-being. Results of Study 1 ( N = 153) showed that higher levels of satisfaction of BPN were related to higher well-being during the COVID-19 outbreak. In Study 2 ( N = 215), we employed an online intervention enhancing these BPN. We found increased mental well-being through bolstered relatedness in particular. The intervention also decreased perceived stress. Both studies showed that mental well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic is positively related to the ability to work as usual and the number of people contacted via phone or <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> but not in person.</p>

<p>User created content (UCC) is created and shared by common users on line. From the user’s perspective, the increase of UCCs has led to an expansion of alternative means of communications, while from the business perspective UCCs have formed an environment in which an abundant amount of new contents can be produced. Despite outward quantitative growth, however, many aspects of UCCs do not meet the expectations of general users in terms of quality, and this can be observed through pirated contents and user-copied contents. The purpose of this research is to investigate effective methods for fostering production of creative user-generated content. This study proposes two core elements, namely, reward and motivation, which are believed to enhance content creativity as well as the mediating factor and users’ committement, which will be effective for bridging the increasing motivation and content creativity. Based on this perspective, this research takes an in-depth look at issues related to constructing the dimensions of reward and motivation in UCC services for creative content product, which are identified in three phases. First, three dimensions of rewards have been proposed: task dimension, social dimension, and organizational dimention. The task dimension rewards are related to the inherent characteristics of a task such as writing blog articles and pasting photos. Four concrete ways of providing task-related rewards in UCC environments are suggested in this study, which include skill variety, task significance, task identity, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The social dimensioni rewards are related to the connected relationships among users. The organizational dimension consists of monetary payoff and recognition from others. Second, the two types of motivations are suggested to be affected by the diverse rewards schemes: intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation. Inrinsic motivation occurs when people create new UCC contents for its’ own sake, whereas extrinsic motivation occurs when people create new contents for other purposes such as fame and money. Third, commitments are suggested to work as important mediating variables between motivation and content creativity. We believe commitments are especially important in online environments because they have been found to exert stronger impacts on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> users than other relevant factors do. Two types of commitments are suggested in this study: emotional commitment and continuity commitment. Finally, content creativity is proposed as the final dependent variable in this study. We provide a systematic method to measure the creativity of UCC content based on the prior studies in creativity measurement. The method includes expert evaluation of blog pages posted by the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> users. In order to test the theoretical model of our study, 133 active blog users were recruited to participate in a group discussion as well as a survey. They were asked to fill out a questionnaire on their commitment, motivation and rewards of creating UCC contents. At the same time, their creativity was measured by independent experts using Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking. Finally, two independent users visited the study participants’ blog pages and evaluated their content creativity using the Creative Products Semantic Scale. All the data were compiled and analyzed through structural equation modeling. We first conducted a confirmatory factor analysis to validate the measurement model of our research. It was found that measures used in our study satisfied the requirement of reliability, convergent validity as well as discriminant validity. Given the fact that our measurement model is valid and reliable, we proceeded to conduct a structural model analysis. The results indicated that all the variables in our model had higher than necessary explanatory powers in terms of R-square values. The study results identified several important reward shemes. First of all, skill variety, task importance, task identity, and automony were all found to have significant influences on the intrinsic motivation of creating UCC contents. Also, the relationship with other users was found to have strong influences upon both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Finally, the opportunity to get recognition for their UCC work was found to have a significant impact on the extrinsic motivation of UCC users. However, different from our expectation, monetary compensation was found not to have a significant impact on the extrinsic motivation. It was also found that commitment was an important mediating factor in UCC environment between motivation and content creativity. A more fully mediating model was found to have the highest explanation power compared to no-mediation or partially mediated models. This paper ends with implications of the study results. First, from the theoretical perspective this study proposes and empirically validates the commitment as an important mediating factor between motivation and content creativity. This result reflects the characteristics of online environment in which the UCC creation activities occur voluntarily. Second, from the practical perspective this study proposes several concrete reward factors that are germane to the UCC environment, and their effectiveness to the content creativity is estimated. In addition to the quantitive results of relative importance of the reward factrs, this study also proposes concrete ways to provide the rewards in the UCC environment based on the FGI data that are collected after our participants finish asnwering survey questions. Finally, from the methodological perspective, this study suggests and implements a way to measure the UCC content creativity independently from the content generators’ creativity, which can be used later by future research on UCC creativity. In sum, this study proposes and validates important reward features and their relations to the motivation, commitment, and the content creativity in UCC environment, which is believed to be one of the most important factors for the success of UCC and Web 2.0. As such, this study can provide significant theoretical as well as practical bases for fostering creativity in UCC contents.</p>

<p>The growth of older adults in new regions poses challenges for public health. We know that these seniors live increasingly alone, and this impairs their health and general wellbeing. Studies suggest that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s (SNS) can reduce isolation, improve social participation, and increase <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the characteristics of older adult users of SNS in these new territories. Without this information, it is not possible to improve the adoption of SNS in this population. Based on decision trees, this study analyzes how the elderly users of various SNS in Chile are like. For this purpose, a segmentation of the different groups of elderly users of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networks was constructed, and the most discriminating variables concerning the use of these applications were classified. The results highlight the existence of considerable differences between the various social networks analyzed in their use and characterization. Educational level is the most discriminating variable, and gender influences the types of SNS use. In general, it is observed that the higher the educational level, the more the different social networking site</span>s are used.</p>

<p>Gaming Disorder is a recognised mental health condition with a very narrow range of treatment options. This pre-post study recruited 50 adult gamers from New Zealand to test the feasibility of a brief <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>-delivered intervention. The intervention components were derived from Implementation Intention principles whereby the gap between intention and behaviour was targeted. The intervention delivery was in accordance with Self-Determination Theory to facilitate <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (personalised goals and action plans), competence (facilitated coping plans, self-monitoring, and relapse prevention) and relatedness (access to a goal coach providing written feedback and support to implement plans). Follow-up evaluation at 3-months indicated the intervention was feasible as it demonstrated rapid recruitment, program engagement (86% used the program), and high satisfaction (easy to understand and convenient). Plans most frequently focused on behavioural substitution and lifestyle change, and the most frequent barrier to change was time management followed by social pressure. Completers (n ​= ​35) reported a significant increase in well-being and reduction in severity, intensity, and time spent gaming, which reduced from an average of 29 to 11 ​hours per week. Delivery of a brief <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>-delivered intervention shows promise and could be used to treat people experiencing problems who are unable or unwilling to access face-to-face treatment. • A brief intervention is associated with reduced gaming time and frequency, and symptom severity. • 88% of participants elected to reduce gaming, with just 12% planning abstinence. • Time management and social pressure are the most salient barriers to change. • Personalised change plans most often target substitution and lifestyle change. • Brief and focused coaching can facilitate engagement with an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>-delivered program.</p>

<p>The purpose of the study was the evaluation of a teacher in-service training program, namely “PE.T.Co.N.“, an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>y of practice via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> groups. Drawing from Self-Determination theory (SDT), the program aimed at satisfying teachers’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness needs and facilitating their autonomous motivation. Pre-post measurements showed significant improvements in key variables that can determine training success. Preliminary quantitative group insights supported by qualitative data revealed enhanced participatory dynamics in terms of members’ interaction. Findings suggest that PE.T.Co.N. is a promising, innovative approach to teacher training. Implications are discussed in light of SDT. • PE teacher in-service training can be delivered effectively as a CoP through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> groups. • <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> appears a promising tool to tackle the attrition issue in on-line training. • PETCoN participation leads/contributes to increased <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> need satisfaction. • PETCoN increases relatedness need satisfaction and decreases relatedness frustration. • Self-determination theory is well suited when designing teacher in-service training.</p>

<p>Abstract Modern organizations must use the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, digital and mobile devices to respond to business demands efficiently. It is also imperative for practitioners and researchers to understand the adverse effects of problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and mobile device usage in the workplace. Moreover, findings from existing studies are insufficient or less relevant or lack applicability in the context of workplace safety behavior. This paper contributes to the literature by examining the mechanisms in which problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> usage lowers workers safety behavior and the moderating role of time <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Data was obtained from workers in the Turkish maritime industry using a simple random sampling technique (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;344) and analyzed with partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Results from PLS-SEM demonstrate that problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use reduces safety behavior and time <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> enhances safety behavior. Time <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> attenuates the negative impact of problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use on safety behavior. Unlike previous studies, this paper highlights the pernicious effects of problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use and beneficial effects of time <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in shaping modern workplace safety behaviors. Based on these results, several managerial prescriptions and theoretical implications are rendered, and future research directions are highlighted.</p>

<p>The study examines parental mediation strategies of adolescent <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use and their relation to adolescent age, concerns of online risks, online activities and risky behavior. Prior research on parental mediation is inconclusive about the effectiveness or superiority of any mediation strategy. Additionally, concerns and awareness of risks were not previously studied with respect to mediation strategies. A mixed-method study involved a survey of 357 adolescents ages 12–18 and 156 young adolescents ages 9–11, followed by semi-structured interviews with parents, teachers and adolescents. Various behavioral, attitudinal, perceptual and habitual aspects of adolescent <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use and types of parental mediation were measured. Results illustrate how parents combine mediation strategies in a variety of formats and contexts. Restrictive mediation correlated with increased adolescent concerns, suggesting an internalization of risks and consequences of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use. However, restrictive mediation correlated with decreased <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> activity and increased risks, possibly due to lack of adolescent experience and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in navigating online risks. Conversely, active mediation correlated with increased <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> activity of any sort, which enables experimentation and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in using the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, and did not correlate with risk. The study compares mediation strategies with parenting styles and concludes that a balanced combination of restrictive and active mediation, arguably supplies the best grounds for adolescents to develop a strong set of norms and boundaries and be able to self-regulate their own <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> activities.</p>

<p>Abstract. Previous research shows that perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support is significantly associated with positive health outcomes for different clinical populations. However, there is not a standardized measurement tool that assesses perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support for the Turkish population. This study translated the Health Care Climate Questionnaire (HCCQ), a perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support measurement tool, into Turkish and investigated the factorial structure of the questionnaire with a group of patients with cancer. This study used a convenience-sampling method with 192 people with cancer. The participants were recruited from a major cancer institute and a non-profit organization in Turkey by research partners. Volunteer participants either filled out a hard copy of a survey packet or completed the survey packet through a secured online survey tool website (i.e., https://www.surveymonkey.com ). In addition, a closed <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> group for cancer survivors in Turkey was used to advertise the study’s link. The results indicated the participants perceived a moderate level of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support. In comparison to German and US populations, perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support was low among Turkish cancer patients. The results also indicated that the HCCQ has a two-factor measurement structure. Correlations with external variables indicated that the scores of HCCQ were significantly positively associated with life satisfaction and quality of life of cancer patients and negatively associated with cancer related symptoms (e.g., fatigue).</p>

<p>Self-determination theory posits that feeling related, competent, and autonomous is central to wellbeing. However, meeting these psychological needs can become difficult as adults age. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> use has been associated with enhanced relatedness, competence, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in a student population, but the effect of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> use on the psychological needs in older adults has yet to be investigated. Drawing from self-determination theory, we investigated whether <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> use facilitated older adults’ relatedness, competence, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> needs, and the relationship between these psychological needs and levels of mobility. One hundred and twenty-seven adults ( Mage = 71), completed an online survey that measured <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> use, relatedness, competence, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and levels of mobility.

<p>Abstract Sports associations have an interest in the maintenance of a level playing field among all participants. Athletes are therefore bound by the same sporting rules. This also applies to minor athletes who compete at the highest level of their sport. The disciplinary <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of sports governing bodies enables them to initiate sports investigations against minor athletes alleged of being in violation of sports regulations, including those pertaining to doping and match manipulation. During the investigations, minor athletes may be obliged to attend sports interrogations or grant full access to diverse of personal information and documentary evidence, including <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s, SMS and WhatsApp conversations, and health records. However, the vulnerability of young athletes requires sufficient protection of minors and safeguards in sports investigation proceedings. The aim of this article is to examine the legality of internal sports investigation proceedings against minors in respect to doping and manipulation of sports competition matters. In particular, it analyses whether it is legitimate and reasonable to use investigative measures contained in the regulations of sports governing bodies against minor athletes in the light of the principle of proportionality.</p>

<p>This study explored the interplay of adolescents’ perceived maternal and paternal practices and their associations with traditional and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying victimization experiences among adolescents. Participants included 439 Grades 7–11 adolescents (242 girls) from five secondary schools in Hong Kong. Moderation analyses were conducted controlling for adolescents sex. No strengthening effects were found between maternal × paternal control and maternal × paternal <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-support in relation to bullying victimization experiences. No buffering effect of parental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-support was evident in the association between parental control and traditional bullying victimization. However, high levels of paternal <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-support were associated with more frequent reports of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying victimization at high levels of maternal control but not low levels. A similar pattern emerged for maternal <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-support and paternal control. These findings imply that inconsistent parenting might increase adolescents’ likelihood for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying victimization.</p>

<p>Background Engagement with physical activity mobile apps has been reported to be a core precondition for their effectiveness in digital behavior change interventions. However, to date, little attention has been paid to understanding the perspectives, needs, expectations, and experiences of potential users with physical activity mobile apps. Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the features that are judged to be important for engagement with a physical activity mobile app and the reasons for their importance. Methods A qualitative focus-group methodology with elements of co-design was adopted in this study. Participants reporting sedentary lifestyles and willingness to improve their physical activity behavior through mobile technology were recruited. The focus group sessions consisted of 13 participants (8 men and 5 women, mean [SD] age 41.9 [7.1] years). Two researchers conducted the data analysis independently by using the inductive thematic approach. Results Four main themes emerged in relation to the research question and were named as follows: “physical activity participation motives,” “<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and self-regulation,” “need for relatedness,” and “smart.” Additionally, 2 subthemes originated from “physical activity participation motives” (ie, “medical guidance” and “weight loss and fitness for health”) and “smart” (ie, “action planning” and “adaptable and tailored”). Conclusions Features enhancing <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and self-regulation and positively affecting health and physical well-being as well as the need for relatedness, adaptability, and flexibility should be considered as core elements in the engagement of potential users with physical activity mobile apps. The emerged findings may orient future research and interventions aiming to foster engagement of potential users with physical activity apps.</p>

<p>This article addresses the centrality of images in the definition of a new paradigm for ageing, when health (measured by <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>) becomes a condition for freedom (associated with youth). Based on a 16-month ethnography conducted with older people (aged 50–80) in a middle-class district in São Paulo, Brazil, I found that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s empower older people to craft a health identity by engaging and producing content that highlights the positive aspects of ageing. In this community, health is a concept deeply associated with productivity, and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> becomes a space for participants to present themselves as busy, giving visibility to all of the activities they engage with. On WhatsApp groups, participants can also work as curators, sharing content that is in the public interest, which improves their collective experience of ageing and restores their sense of utility and dignity. I found that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s also allow participants to manipulate the mechanism of social comparison used to classify who is healthy and who is old. Often, when they have a condition or frailty, they confine themselves to online interactions, hiding from view the ageing body that could compromise their performance. By doing that, their declines are kept on the backstage of their social interactions, allowing participants to extend their presence within the third age, which is associated with freedom and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, while the decline related to the fourth age is kept in the shadows.</p>

<p>The problem of adolescent online gaming addiction is related to individual-level characteristics and the influence of the family environment. The present study explores the potential role of adolescents’ time management tendency in mediating the relationship between parenting style and adolescent <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> gaming disorder (IGD). Responses from a total of 357 Chinese high school students were collected for a Pathological Video-Game Use Questionnaire, Simplified Parenting Styles Scale, and Time Management Tendency Scale. Overall, participants reported moderate use of online games (Mean = 1.41; SD = 0.41), lower than the median value of 2 on a three-point scale. In terms of the mediating role of adolescents’ time management tendency, full meditation was observed for the relationship between the parenting style factor of “parents’ emotional warmth” for both mothers and fathers and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> gaming disorder. The results highlight the benefits of emotional warmth in supporting self-efficacy, self-control, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> through the promotion of time management, which is an important protective factor for IGD and can serve as a mediating personality variable. Although non-significant in the complete model, over-protection and rejection by parents should also be cautiously considered as potential risk factors related to addiction.</p>

<p>Purpose This study aims to investigate how <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> services can improve the well-being of elderly consumers. Drawing on transformative service research (TSR) and technology adoption literature, it examines the main challenges for the elderly when adopting <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> services and how they and their family members can co-create value to improve the elderly service inclusion and well-being. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative methodology is used to identify challenges, value co-creation behaviors and well-being outcomes of elderly individuals and their family members when using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> services. The data collection method involved 24 in-depth interviews with consumers over 75 years of age and their family members. Findings This research first recognizes specific challenges for the elderly in adopting <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> services related to resistance to technology adoption and health impairments. Second, the findings identify value co-creation behaviors held by elderly consumers of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> services: learning and formal training, complying with indications and seeking help when they encounter problems with technology. Family members also contribute to elderly well-being through two value co-creation behaviors: helping and supporting elderly relatives with technology and being patient and tolerant when they need support. Finally, these behaviors are found to influence five dimensions of elderly consumers’ well-being: enjoyment, personal growth, mastery, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and social connectedness. Originality/value This study addresses a gap in the literature by exploring the value co-creation behaviors of elderly consumers of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> services and their family members for improving well-being outcomes. Understanding value co-creation and well-being for elderly consumers of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> services is an emerging and under-researched area in TSR and service inclusion literature.</p>

<p>Problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> use (PIU) has become public health concern, particularly among adolescents and emerging adults. There is growing interest concerning the potential impacts of early maladaptive schemas (EMSs) on PIU and its most severe manifestation <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> addiction (IA). However, a deeper understanding of these relationships is needed regarding of effects of schemas on IA. The purpose of the present study was to explore the role of EMSs among adults.The sample comprised 714 Iranian participants who completed a self-report survey comprising sociodemographic variables, the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> Addiction Test (IAT), and the Young Schema Questionnaire-Short Form (YSQ-SF). The data were analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM).Findings indicated that there was a positive and significant relationship between EMS domains and IA. The results confirmed that disconnection/rejection schema domains and impaired <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>/performance schema domains were significantly related with IA. The results of the analysis of convergent validity and discriminant validity were acceptable among the nine reflective constructs.Findings of the present study indicated that existence of underlying EMSs may be a vulnerability factor for developing IA and adds to the growing body of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>psychology literature that has examined the relationships between the EMSs and IA.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span>bullying victimization is associated with mental health problems and reported to occur more in nonheterosexual orientation youth (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and questioning (LGBQ)) than among heterosexual youth. Parental support may protect against mental health problems after being victimized, but nonsupportive parental influences may also exacerbate harm. This study investigated whether parenting dimensions (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support, psychological control) moderated the associations between bullying victimization and mental health problems among heterosexual and LGBQ adolescents. An anonymous survey was completed by 1037 adolescents (M age = 15.2 ± 1.9, 50% female). Regression analyses examined associations between victimization, sexual orientation, and mental health problems, and investigated the moderating role of parenting. Both forms of victimization were associated with higher mental health problems. LGBQ youth experienced more depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation than heterosexual youth. Lower levels of parental psychological control and higher levels of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support were related to having fewer mental health problems. However, perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support appeared less protective when adolescents experienced more frequent victimization. Moreover, parental psychological control was related to heightened risk for suicidal plans specifically among LGBQ youth and also exacerbated the association between <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying victimization and stress among LGBQ youth. These findings underscore the need to address parenting in whole-school antibullying and mental health promotion programs.</p>

<p>Purpose Online games are prevalent <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> applications and are known for satisfying the various needs of users. Nonetheless, little is known about whether online games could be a resort for users encountering workplace frustration. Explaining how workplace frustration and users’ need satisfaction affect loyalty of online gamers, this study aims to formulate hypotheses and develop a framework based on the self-determination theory (SDT). Design/methodology/approach The authors use an online survey to collect 848 responses and use structural equation modelling to test the hypotheses. Findings The authors find that workplace frustration, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> need satisfaction and competence need satisfaction are positively related to online gamer loyalty. Moreover, workplace frustration enhances the link between competence need satisfaction and online gamer loyalty. Originality/value The authors are the first to use SDT to identify the three antecedents and the moderator of online gamer loyalty. Our findings offer a key message that game providers could design effective means to retain their gamers by understanding their gamers’ workplace frustration and informing them that playing games could alleviate the associated negative feelings.</p>

<p>Purpose The emergence of mHealth applications has led to the rise of health-based services delivered over <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s. Younger people are often found to be more innovative toward technology, especially related to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s (Rai et al.&nbsp;, 2013). Most mHealth application downloaders are continually shifting between applications because of the hyper-competition making achieving loyal consumers challenging (Racherla et al.&nbsp;, 2012). The purpose of this paper is to study the determinants that help increase young consumers mHealth application loyalty. This study integrates self-determination theory (SDT), gamification elements and engagement to examine loyalty. Design/methodology/approach A valid sample of 263 college student’s data was obtained for data analysis from a survey conducted in multiple campuses of the Delhi University in India. Findings The three psychological needs: need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, need for competence and need for relatedness, showed a positive impact on intrinsic motivation. From the gamification factors; perceived playfulness, the level of challenge and social interaction, only the first two showed a positive impact on extrinsic motivation. Both motivation factors influence engagement, showing a frequent interaction with the application, leading to loyalty. Originality/value Previous studies examined the adoption of mHealth services, this study is one of the first to examine young consumers’ loyalty in using mhealth apps. It sheds light on the existing literature and contributes to research on mHealth applications by determining the factors that lead to loyalty by the young consumers.</p>

<p>Two preregistered experiments with 2,733 U.S. high school students (age range = 13-19 years) compared the impact of different messages on adolescents’ motivation to control <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use (SMU). A traditional message emphasized the benefits of avoiding SMU, whereas a values-alignment message framed controlling SMU as being consistent with <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and social justice. Compared to no message or a traditional message, in both studies, a values-alignment message led to greater motivation to control SMU immediately afterward, and in Study 2, awareness of “addictive” <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> designs 3 months later. As hypothesized, values-alignment messaging was more motivating for girls than boys. Results offer preliminary support for leveraging adolescents’ drives for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and social justice to motivate self-regulation of SMU.</p>

<p>Serendipity refers to unexpected encounters with ideas or insights and their intentional application to achieve favorable outcomes. Despite extensive prior studies, the concept lacks theoretical logic and empirical validation regarding the role of an intentional act in the relationship between serendipitous encounters and their favorable outcomes. Drawing from self-determination theory, we develop a model that highlights the role of needs satisfaction in explaining this relationship. Positioning the empirical context to fortunate discoveries of information and social connections in professional use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span>, we validate the model by a cross-sectional survey study of 473 users. The model builds on the observation that individuals’ serendipitous encounters are associated with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span>-enabled innovation, that is, a contextualized form of task innovation. The study findings support the research model revealing that serendipitous encounters are positively associated with needs satisfaction and that needs satisfaction is positively associated with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span>-enabled innovation. In other words, fortunate discoveries of new information and contacts increase <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span> users’ intent to utilize the platform in new ways to accomplish work when the three key psychological needs of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness are satisfied.</p>

<p>This paper presents a system for realistic behavioral programming of virtual characters, based on personality and probabilistic automata. We describe personality by using the Five-Factor Model and achieve <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> through a goal-oriented approach. Each character perceives the surrounding world, decides how to behave and acts on the environment according to its personality and to its goals. The chief idea explored by the proposed approach is that personality has a probabilistic influence on behavior selection instead of a deterministic one. Different behavior sequences available to achieve a goal are modeled using probabilistic automata and making probability dependent on character personality. This leads to non-repetitive behaviors, whose evolution is not foreseeable. The paper first motivates the approach in the context of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>therapy. Then, it summarizes related work and illustrates in detail the proposed approach. Finally, it presents obtained results and discusses the main limitations of the implemented system.

<p>Abstract This paper delves into the nuances of ‘fashion’ in recommender systems and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> analytics, which shape and define an individual’s perception and self-relationality. Its aim is twofold: first, it supports a different perspective on privacy that focuses on the individual’s process of identity construction considering the social and personal aspects of ‘fashion’. Second, it underlines the limitations of computational models in capturing the diverse meaning of ‘fashion’, whereby the algorithmic prediction of user preferences is based on individual conscious and unconscious associations with fashion identity. I test both of these claims in the context of current concerns over the impact of algorithmic personalisation systems on individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and privacy: creating ‘filter bubbles’, nudging the user beyond their conscious awareness, as well as the inherent bias in algorithmic decision-making. We need an understanding of privacy that sustains the inherent reduction of fashion identity to literal attributes and protects individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in shaping algorithmic approximations of the self.</p>

<p>Introduction: Adolescence is a phase involving risk taking, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, adventure and efforts to fit into adulthood. Physical and emotional changes, peers, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, education, family expectations etc. make individuals vulnerable. Aims: To study the prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress in school going adolescents from 9th -12th standard from Bagdogra, to examine the association with family factors and Socio Economic Status and to identify the co-morbidities between Depression, Anxiety and Stress. Methods: A cross sectional study was carried out using DASS-21 scale on a total of 231 students. In addition, a self-structured questionnaire on family structure and socio economic status was administered and SPSS software was used for analysis. Result: Overall, 76.2% had at least one of the mental morbidities under study. Depression was significantly more common in class 12th, (28.4%), 9th (28.4%) &amp;10th (27.6%) and stress was significantly common in 12th(55.4%) &amp; 10th (55.2%). There was no significant difference in relation to age, sex, family structure and socioeconomic status. All mental morbidities more frequently occurred in combination with each other, rather than exclusively. Depression most frequently occurred with stress (8 times) followed by anxiety (4 times), whereas anxiety was 6 times more likely to occur with stress. Conclusions: Almost 3 out of 4 children had symptoms related to at least one of the mental morbidities discussed. Depression and stress was significantly more prevalent in students answering board exams (class 10th and 12th) than those not answering board exams. Depression, Anxiety and Stress were highly correlated with each other.</p>

<p>This study explored the impact of assistive technology on the well-being of legally blind adults.In this mixed-method study, a convenience sample of 86 legally blind adults took an electronic survey. The questionnaire was comprised of demographics, use patterns, and an instrument called TENS-Interface that measured the impact of technology on well-being categories of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness. Descriptive statistics, reliability, power analysis and bivariate correlations were calculated using SPSS statistical software. Three participants completed follow up semi-structured interviews, which were analysed for themes of technological mediation using NVivo 12 software.The TENS-Interface was validated for use with a legally blind population. Descriptive statistics showed a higher mean for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> than competence or relatedness. Braille was positively correlated to both <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and competence, while screen reader proficiency was related to competence. Daily use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">instant mess</span>aging, and video calls were correlated to relatedness. The technological devices used by interview participants were analysed for technological mediation. Training was identified as an additional theme.Recommendations for practice include providing training to legally blind adults in screen reader use and braille use to support well-being via competence and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Training is also recommended for this population in the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>, and video calls to promote well-being through opportunities for relatedness. Further research is recommended to explore instructional methods that are not only efficient, but also meaningful for older adults in the position of losing their vision.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONProviding access to braille instruction and braille assistive technology equipment can promote legally blind adults’ well-being by supporting their basic needs for both competence and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.Providing training in screen reader use can promote legally blind adults’ well-being by supporting their basic need for competence.Providing training in use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, video calls, and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">instant mess</span>aging can promote legally blind adults’ well-being by supporting their basic need for relatedness.A consideration of technological mediation can allow practitioners to make recommendations that take into account not only efficient task completion, but issues related to meaning and social context.Instruction for adults losing their vision adventitiously needs to address not only efficient task performance, but also meaning and social context.</p>

<p>In the COVID-19 pandemic, human solidarity plays a crucial role in meeting this maybe greatest modern societal challenge. Public health communication targets enhancing collective compliance with protective health and safety regulations. Here, we asked whether authoritarian/controlling message framing as compared to a neutral message framing may be more effective than moralizing/prosocial message framing and whether recipients’ self-rated trait <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> might lessen these effects. In a German sample (n = 708), we measured approval of seven regulations (e.g., reducing contact, wearing a mask) before and after presenting one of three <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span> messages (authoritarian, moralizing, neutral/control) presented by either a high-authority sender (state secretary) or a low-authority sender (social worker). We found that overall, the messages successfully increased participants’ endorsement of the regulations, but only weakly so because of ceiling effects. Highly autonomous participants showed more consistent responses across the two measurements, i.e., lower response shifting, in line with the concept of reactive <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Specifically, when the sender was a social worker, response shifting correlated negatively with trait <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. We suggest that a trusted sender encourages more variable responses to imposed societal regulations in individuals low in <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and we discuss several aspects that may improve health communication.</p>

<p>Exercise is an effective intervention to prevent falls in older adults; however, long-term adherence is often poor. To increase adherence, additional support for behavior change has been advocated. However, consistency in the reporting of interventions using behavior change techniques is lacking. Recently, a classification system has been developed to increase consistency in studies using behavior change techniques within the self-determination theory.This study aimed to explore expressions of self-determination among community-dwelling older adults using a self-managed digital fall prevention exercise program comprising behavior change support (the Safe Step program), which was developed in co-creation with intended users.The qualitative study design was based on open-ended responses to questionnaires, and individual and focus group interviews. A deductive qualitative content analysis was applied using the classification system of motivation and behavior change techniques as an analytical matrix, followed by an inductive analysis. Twenty-five participants took part in a feasibility study and exercised in their homes with the Safe Step program for 4 months. The exercise program was available on computers, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s, and tablets, and was fully self-managed.In the deductive analysis, expressions of support were demonstrated for all three basic human psychological needs, namely, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness. These expressions were related to 11 of the 21 motivation and behavior change techniques in the classification system. The inductive analysis indicated that <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (to be in control) was valued and enabled individual adaptations according to different rationales for realizing exercise goals. However, the experience of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> was also two-sided and depended on the participants’ competence in exercise and the use of technology. The clarity of the program and exercise videos was seen as key for support in performance and competent choices. Although augmented techniques for social support were requested, support through relatedness was found within the program.In this study, the Safe Step program supported the establishment of new exercise routines, as well as the three basic human psychological needs, with <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and competence being expressed as central in this context. Based on the participants’ experiences, a proposed addition to the classification system used as an analytical matrix has been presented.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02916849; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02916849.</p>

<p>Introduction: Adolescents are vulnerable to addictions such as tobacco, alcohol, pornography, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> use etc. Due to high exposure to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and gadgets, the involvement of adolescents in digital gaming has increased significantly in recent years. Excessive digital gaming may affect the mental health status. Aim: To measure the prevalence of digital gaming and to assess the relationship between digital gaming and psychological well-being among college going adolescents. Materials and Methods: A college based cross-sectional study was conducted among 415 adolescents (≤19 years of age) studying in arts, engineering and medical colleges located in Puducherry. The study participants were recruited using stratified multistage sampling technique. After obtaining written informed consent, study participants were interviewed using a structured questionnaire consisting of variables such as socio-demography, usage and pattern of digital gaming. Gaming Addiction Scale was used to assess the level of addiction to digital gaming. Psychological well-being score was assessed using 42 items Ryff’s scale with six domains such as <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relations with others, purpose in life and self-acceptance. Data was analysed in IBM SPSS Statistics for windows, Version 21.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, New York). Chi-square test and one-way ANOVA tests were used to measure the p-value, p&lt;0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: Out of 415 study participants, 83.1% were current or past players of digital games. Females (93%) ever played more than males (74%) (p&lt;0.001). The proportion of current/past gamers was lowest in the participants aged 17 years (49.1%) (p&lt;0.001). All engineering and arts students (100%) played the digital games either currently or in past, however it was only 48.9% among medical students (p&lt;0.001). Majority (53.6%) played in both online and offline mode. About three-fourth (76.2%) of the study participants were playing digital games at their homes. The proportion of daily playing digital gamers was higher in females (28.6%) than males (23.4%) but statistically not significant (p=0.215). A 29% of the study participants felt bad when they were unable to play games. The prevalence of addictive and problematic users among those who were playing digital games was 4.3% and 33.6%, respectively. The mean score of self-acceptance dimension of psychological well-being was lowest among current users than past and never users with statistical significance (p=0.046). However, the dimension of personal growth was higher among current and never users than past users (p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: Most of the college going adolescents had ever played digital games. There was no significant relationship between psychological well-being and digital gaming except for personal growth and self-acceptance dimensions.</p>

<p>The data from world researches of gifted adolescents who are addicted from the virtual environment and their peers is presented in the article. The theoretical foundations of gifted adolescents’ addiction prevention from the virtual environment are presented. Various currents of researchers’ views on the adolescents’ giftedness factor and the associated addiction risks on the virtual environment are shown. Conclusions about the urgent need to prevent this phenomenon are drawn. The risk factors for the addiction emergence of gifted adolescents on the virtual environment have been identified. The model of addiction prevention on the virtual environment is described. Teenage age – transitional age which is characterized by all systems of an organism formation. During this period perhaps unstable condition of the teenager’s nervous system strengthened by daily stressor which accumulatingly can generate a stress. All these factors can provoke an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>-dependent behavior emergence among the presented and not gifted teenagers therefore prospect of further researches is gifted teenagers’ dependence on the virtual environment correction program creation. On the given results basis of the world researches on dependence on the virtual environment, namely <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> dependence, we had a vision of gifted teenagers’ dependence process which we presented in the form of dependence prevention theoretical model which we also use further in practice. According to our model of gifted teenagers’ dependence prevention on the virtual environment, personal labour is the component bringing out of dependence. The steady condition of a teenager’s nervous system is a basis of dependence prevention. The <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the teenager’s identity is an integrated basis of dependence prevention on the virtual environment. Facing considered by us researches’ results about increase in destructive use of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> by teenagers, further work on prevention and correction of gifted teenagers’ dependence on the virtual environment seems necessary to us</p>

<p>Abstract <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Smartphone</span> sensors allow measurement of phenomena that are difficult or impossible to capture via self-report (e.g., geographical movement, physical activity). Sensors can reduce respondent burden by eliminating survey questions and improve measurement accuracy by replacing/augmenting self-reports. However, if respondents who are not willing to collect sensor data differ on critical attributes from those who are, the results can be biased. Research on the mechanisms of willingness to collect sensor data mostly comes from (nonprobability) online panels and is hypothetical (i.e., asks participants about the likelihood of participation in a sensor-based study). In a cross-sectional general population randomized experiment, we investigate how features of the request and respondent characteristics influence willingness to share (WTS) and actually sharing <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>-sensor data. We manipulate the request to either mention or not mention (1) how participation will benefit the participant, (2) participants’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> over data collection, and (3) that data will be kept confidential. We assess nonparticipation bias using the administrative records. WTS and actually sharing varies by sensor task, participants’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> over data sharing, their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> skills, level of privacy concerns, and attitudes toward surveys. Fewer people agree to share photos and a video than geolocation, but all who agreed to share photos or a video actually did. Some nonresponse and nonparticipation biases are substantial and make each other worse, but others jointly reduce the overall bias. Our findings suggest that sensor-data-sharing decisions depend on sample members’ situation when asked to share and the nature of the sensor task rather than the sensor type.</p>

<p>Based on the characteristics of convenience, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and equality, online self-media has become an important way for contemporary migrant workers to observe the world, understand society, examine themselves and express their demands. On the basis of the analysis of the domestic migrant works’ concerns and their emotion analysis, we crawl data on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Weibo</span> about migrant works’ topics as the basic corpus of migrant works’ concerns, and then uses a combination of TF-IDF and Word2Vec methods to construct a recognition model of migrant workers’ concerns. We found that wages, children’s education, medical care and returning home are the main concerns of migrant workers. Meanwhile, further emotion analysis of the migrant works’ concerns of using a deep learning model fused with Bi-LSTM and CNN was conducted. The results show that the proportion of negative emotion such as worries, complaints and impetuosity was significantly higher than that of other positive and neutral emotion like encourage and comfort. And the time when the negative emotion are concentrated is significantly related to the social events that occur in the corresponding time period. On the one hand, it shows that the concerns and emotion of migrant workers can be effectively observed and predicted through web text data. On the other hand, it also shows that the core well-being issues of migrant workers in the process of urban integration have not been effectively solved, and the government and relevant departments need to take targeted measures and give priority attention.</p>

<p>Purpose The authors develop a conceptual model to examine how three basic psychological needs (i.e.&nbsp;needs for competence, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and relatedness) affect employee <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use (i.e.&nbsp;work- and social-related use). The authors propose that the need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> positively moderates the relationship between need for competence and work-related use, whereas it negatively moderates that between need for relatedness and social-related use. Design/methodology/approach To test the proposed model, 332 internal and 271 external <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> users in the workplace were recruited. Findings The results indicate that needs for competence and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and needs for relatedness and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> positively affect the work- and social-related use, respectively, of internal and external <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. Need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> positively moderates the relationship between need for competence and work-related use of internal <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, and it negatively moderates that between need for relatedness and the social-related use of internal <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. Need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> has no moderating effect on the relationship between need for competence and work-related use, whereas it negatively moderates the relationship between need for relatedness and the social-related use of external <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. Originality/value First, the authors’ findings offer significant empirical support for the different <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> uses, namely work and social related. Second, this study highlights the importance of psychological needs of employees in determining the form of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use. Third, this study empirically demonstrates the differences in psychological needs and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use between two different <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> contexts.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> involves making independent decisions and creating lasting and equitable power relationships within families. Many factors, dependent on both the woman and her partner, can influence self-dependence, and subsequent decision-making, exerting a protective or triggering effect on its development. Therefore, the primary objective of the study was to assess <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in a sample of Lebanese women. The secondary objective was to evaluate the association between socioeconomic status, psychological factors, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.A web based cross-sectional online study was conducted between June 8 and August 1, 2020. The questionnaire developed on Google Forms was distributed through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and WhatsApp groups, using the snowball technique. The Women’s <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> Index (WAI) was created using three items adapted from a previous study. In addition, the Composite Abuse Scale Revised-Short Form (CASR-SF) was used to assess three domains of abuse: physical, sexual, and psychological. The Perceived stress scale short version to measure stress perception, the Lebanese Anxiety Scale to measure anxiety and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to assess depression. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 25 was used for data analysis. Linear regressions were performed, taking the Women’s <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> Index as the dependent variable.The sample consisted of 369 Lebanese women. University education level (beta = 1.263), alcohol consumption (beta = 0.586), intermediate income level (beta = 0.702), high income (beta = 0.911), employment (beta = 0.559), and older age (beta = 0.033) were significantly associated with higher WAI. Living in South Lebanon (beta = - 0.668) and being Druze (beta = - 323) were associated with lower WAI. Significantly higher mean scores of anxiety and perceived stress were found among women with low <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.In Lebanon, the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of women depends on several personal and partner-related characteristics (education, socioeconomic status, age), in addition to the cultural (geographic and religious) environment. Furthermore, low <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is associated with higher perceived stress and anxiety and probable depression and domestic abuse.</p>

<p>Mobile learning (mLearning) has gained popularity in recent years, particularly in the clinical setting. mLearning reduces the theory-practice gap by providing relevant information to nurses and boosting clinical skills. Despite the vast majority of work in this area, few studies in nursing have investigated the correlation between motivation and mLearning for continuing practice development (CPD). Motivation is an essential theoretical concept used to explain human motive that is not new in nursing. Understanding the notion of motivation directed towards learning may clarify the role of technology within pedagogy. Additionally, associating motivation and self-determination may be crucial in understanding motivation in professional nursing practice and education. This study determines the effect of mLearning on motivation to enhance CPD in nursing professionals (NP) analysed critically through a Self-Determination Theory lens. Twenty-three qualified nurses working within the clinical area participated by using a specific mobile application on their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> to learn nursing related skills. Over three weeks, participants logged in their learning experience, providing an overview of the relationship between motivation and mLearning. The nurses participating in the study found mLearning motivational in the clinical setting and indicated ownership of their learning, suggesting perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Furthermore, the mobile application enhanced nursing practices through gaining competency and fostered team building through interactions with other health professionals in the clinical area, demonstrating relatedness. This work suggests that having ownership of the learning experience fosters motivation through intrinsic and external needs, supporting learning and gaining competency in the clinical area. Also, the need to become competent and share with others further nurtures motivation to learn in the clinical area. Additionally, these findings suggest mLearning features that motivate NP towards clinical development. This study concludes with implications for the scholarship on mLearning for the continual practice development of nurses.</p>

<p>This study aims at exploring the influence of product design on customer engagement through self-determined needs satisfaction. This study used the survey method in three ways: (1) mall intercept approach, (2) <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> survey, and (3) survey through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Wechat</span>. The sample was collected from 500 customers of electronic products living in Xi’an, China. The data analysis is done through structural equation modeling. Findings show that perceived product design in terms of functional, esthetic, and symbolic design is positively related to self-determined needs (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, relatedness, competence) satisfaction. Furthermore, results reveal that self-determined needs satisfaction has a positive influence on customer engagement. The moderation results show that prevention focused customers moderate the relationship between functional design and self-determined needs satisfaction. Whereas, promotion focused customers moderate the relationship between esthetic design and self-determined needs satisfaction. This study adds value to the self-determination theory by examining the link between product design dimensions and customer engagement through self-determined needs satisfaction. Furthermore, this study adds value to the existing literature on regulatory focus theory.</p>

<p>We explore the benefits and costs of social networking usage and examine the roles of need to belong and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to contextualize the fear of missing out (FoMO) socio-cultural phenomenon in the digital age. We utilize a self-determination theory-based framework for understanding how the FoMO phenomenon influences positive (negative) mood, information overload, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> satisfaction, and engagement with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> advertising. Study 1 explores how FoMO relates to positive mood through the need to belong. Study 2 demonstrates how FoMO impacts information overload through the mediation of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> interactivity. Furthermore, Study 2 shows how FoMO alters <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> satisfaction, and this relationship is mediated by information overload and moderated by <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Study 3 shows that negative emotions serve to mediate the effect of information overload on engagement with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> advertising. Finally, we discuss implications of this study to provide insight into how brand marketers can offer FoMO-reducing mechanisms to consumers to ensure a high level of advertising engagement, how health advocates can leverage <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> to promote meaningful engagement with consumers, and how industry practitioners may want to consider aspirational virtual events to create buzz while also satisfying consumers’ need to belong to social groups.</p>

<p>Rapid advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) are transforming customer service by making it possible to create <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bot applications that can understand users’ intents and response in a human-like manner. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Chat</span>bots promise to enhance customer experiences by creating more personal customer interactions than those afforded by traditional menu-based web applications. But are <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots always superior to more traditional user interfaces (UI)? This study seeks to understand the differences in user satisfaction with a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bot system vis-a-vis a menu-based interface system, and identify factors that influence user satisfaction. Grounded in the self-determination theory, the research model proposed here focuses on the effect of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bot use on perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, perceived competence, cognitive load, performance satisfaction, and system satisfaction. An experimental study was conducted, and data were analyzed using Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling. The findings indicate that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bot systems lead to a lower level of perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and higher cognitive load, compared with menu-based interface systems, resulting in a lower degree of user satisfaction. Implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed. • <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Chat</span>bot are associated with a lower level of perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and higher cognitive load, compared with menu interface. • Perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and perceived competence have a significant effect on performance satisfaction and system satisfaction. • Perceived competence was a stronger predictor of performance satisfaction. • Perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> was a stronger predictor of system satisfaction. • Perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> positively influences perceived competence.</p>

<p>Emotion-aware <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots that can sense human emotions are becoming increasingly prevalent. However, the exposition of emotions by emotion-aware <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots undermines human <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and users’ trust. One way to ensure <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is through the provision of control. Offering too much control, in turn, may increase users’ cognitive effort. To investigate the impact of control over emotion-aware <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots on <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, trust, and cognitive effort, as well as user behavior, we carried out an experimental study with 176 participants. The participants interacted with a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bot that provided emotional feedback and were additionally able to control different <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bot dimensions (e.g., timing, appearance, and behavior). Our findings show, first, that higher control levels increase <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and trust in emotion-aware <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots. Second, higher control levels do not significantly increase cognitive effort. Third, in our post hoc behavioral analysis, we identify four behavioral control strategies based on control feature usage timing, quantity, and cognitive effort. These findings shed light on the individual preferences of user control over emotion-aware <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots. Overall, our study contributes to the literature by showing the positive effect of control over emotion-aware <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots and by identifying four behavioral control strategies. With our findings, we also provide practical implications for future design of emotion-aware <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots. • In this study, we investigated the effect of control over emotion-aware <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots. • Rising ability to control emotion-aware <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots increases user <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and trust. • At the same time, a higher level of control does not increase cognitive effort. • Analyzing users’ control behavior, we identified four distinct control strategies. • Users can be categorized as Soloists, Kickstarter, Controller, and Undecideds.</p>

<p>In recent times gamification has increasingly been used by brands through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s to interact effectively with their consumers. The core assumption for creating gamified environment is that it will develop engagement with the consumer and motivate them to use their product or services. However, beyond this assumption, there is dearth empirical evidence regarding how much effective these gamified features are in engaging consumers. Therefore, this research analyses the relationship between flow, brand engagement, self-brand connection and brand usage intent among consumers (N = 360)of two gamified mobile applications. The findings show that the multidimensional construct flow formed by five dimensions i.e.&nbsp;challenge, feedback, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, immersion, and interaction positively associates with cognitive brand engagement and emotional brand engagement. Additionally, both these forms of brand engagement further strengthen consumers’ brand connection and motivate them for further use. These results imply that gamified environment can augment consumer engagement with brand and further increase usage intention. Therefore, gamification can be an effective technique in brand management and brand managers can use it to strengthen relationship with consumers and increasing possibility of using their brands.</p>

<p>Objectives: This study investigated the impact of positive and negative parenting attitudes on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> dependency in children to examine the mediating effects of online-based leisure such as computer usage, game, and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> usage.Methods: Data of 714 children scoring above the top 30% of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> dependency among the children in 5th grade in elementary school were collected through the 2nd wave of the Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey (KCYPS 2018). Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was applied to analyze the mediating effects with the Bootstrapping method by SPSS 21.0 and AMOS 20.0.Results: In the model, online-based leisure significantly mediated the relationship between positive parenting attitudes such as warmth, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support and structure provision, and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> dependency showing complete mediation. Also, negative parenting attitudes such as rejection, coercion, and chaos directly negatively affected <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> dependency, not showing a mediating effect. Results indicate that increased positive parenting attitudes lead to reduced <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> dependency through decreasing online-based leisure, while negative parenting attitudes lead to increase dependence on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>.Conclusion: While positive parenting attitudes do not directly affect <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> dependency, they lead to a decrease in online-based leisure. Consequently, as online-based leisure lessens, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> dependency subsequently may also be diminished. In addition, although negative parenting attitudes have no mediating effect, they directly influence the growing <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> dependency. Results confirm that positive parenting mediate the effects of online-based activities in relation to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> dependency when parents provide the most structure, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support, and warmth to their children. Practical implications are discussed, and relevant interventions offered for children and parents.</p>

<p>The purpose of the present study was to see whether perception of parents and self-presentation can predict <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> Addiction. This study examined the perception of parents by an individual in the dimensions of warmth, involvement and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support for father and mother and self-presentation in the dimensions of ability- and attempt-to-act among a sample of 142 participants (male (68) and female (74)), age ranging from 18 to 32 years. Results indicated that overall, warmth, involvement and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support of both father and mother, respectively and ability- and attempt-to-act do contribute significantly for predicting <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> Addiction.

<p><span style="background-color:lightgreen">Mobile phone</span>s have evolved to allow individuals to easily access and disclose the private information of others to a seemingly infinite network. Notably, the permanent nature of mobile data has aided its path between individuals and the police, storing integral evidence for criminal investigations in the palms of peoples’ hands. Understanding cognitive factors that predict when an individual would choose to report mobile data to the police is pertinent, particularly in a time of heightened controversy over data access limits and ubiquitous surveillance. This study extends Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) through incorporating the watchful eye effect and the theory of contextual integrity to analyze predictors of intention to share data with the police. The results of a 2 (Situational severity: high or low) x 2 (Surveillance: present or absent) between-subjects factorial vignette methodology ( N = 222) revealed that participants behaved independently of feeling watched, but that such sharing can be causally attributed to situational severity. Further, we found PMT variables—including perceived severity, response-efficacy, self-efficacy, and response cost—as well as perception of the police to serve as predictors of intentions to share with the police, with some of these factors mediating the effects of situational severity and surveillance. This study not only provides a theoretical contribution to PMT but also practical recommendations for mobile design that considers surveillance normalization and prioritizes data <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. • High situational severity crimes causes a high intention to share data with police. • Individuals act independently of surveillance when sharing data with the police. • Results on PMT predictor variables align with that of previous literature. • PMT predictor variables mediate environmental factors and behavioral intention. • Perception of the police acts as a predictor of intention to share data with them.</p>

<p>Prior studies have shown that parent-adolescent relationships and peer relationships may be important factors associated with adolescent <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> addiction (MPA). The present study aims to further explore the direct effects of parent-adolescent and peer relationships on adolescent MPA as well as the indirect effects through the mediating roles of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness needs satisfaction.Our sample consisted of 1766 Chinese adolescents (53.10% male; Mage = 13.33, SD = 1.94, range from 10 to 18 years) who completed questionnaires regarding parent-adolescent relationships, peer relationships, psychological needs satisfaction, and MPA. SPSS 24.0 was used to analyze correlations among variables and Mplus 7.4 was used to test the structural equation model in this study.(1) positive parent-adolescent relationships were negatively associated with adolescent MPA, while peer relationships did not show a significant association with MPA; (2) <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and competence needs satisfaction significantly mediated the effects of parent-adolescent and peer relationships on MPA, while the mediating role of relatedness need satisfaction between parent-adolescent and peer relationships and MPA was not significant; (3) the mediating effect of competence need satisfaction between peer relationships and MPA was significantly stronger than that between parent-adolescent relationships and MPA.This study explored the different mechanisms by which parent-adolescent and peer relationships influence adolescent MPA. These discoveries may contribute to intervention and prevention programs for adolescent MPA.</p>

<p>In light of the accelerated growth of an aging population , coupled with the massive diffusion of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies (ICTs), research on whether ICTs meet the needs of elderly users is important and timely. Despite the popularity of self-determination theory, few studies have adopted this theoretical framework to explain need satisfaction among this group. The continuous use of mobile government (m-government) relies on the satisfaction of citizens’ needs. Through the theoretical lens of self-determination theory, we developed a research model of m-government for elders’ intrinsic need satisfaction. In this model, the design factors, performance factors, and individuals’ ability factors are incorporated. Based on data from 366 m-government-for-elders users in China’s Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces, and through the use of structural equation modeling, the results show that complexity has a negative correlation with <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> need satisfaction and competence need satisfaction. Visual appeal positively affects all dimensions of intrinsic need satisfaction. Information quality has a positive relationship with relatedness need satisfaction. The effects of personalization on relatedness need satisfaction and the influence of personalization on competence need satisfaction were significant. Information literacy moderates the relationship between complexity and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> need satisfaction, as well as between complexity and competence need satisfaction. The findings of this article enrich existing m-government research and provide practical implications for policymakers and m-government developers in China. • The three basic intrinsic needs of seniors users are met by using m-government for elders. • Visual appeal of devices is the most salient driving factor of intrinsic need satisfaction. • We examine the moderating effect of information literacy. • The antecedents of three kinds of intrinsic need satisfaction are different.</p>

<p>Bullying and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying prevention remain a major priority for schools, communities, and families, and research is clear that positive, constructive parenting practices can play a key preventive role. The current work explores six dimensions of parenting (warmth, structure, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support, rejection, chaos, and coercion), and their specific relationship to school and online bullying. Using survey data from a nationally representative sample of 1474 English-speaking 12- to 17-year-old US youth, we found that students whose parent(s) exhibit warmth, structure, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support are less likely to have engaged in bullying or <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying offending, while those with parental relations marked by rejection, chaos, and coercion are more likely to have participated in both forms of peer aggression. Implications for developing stronger parent-child relationships through improved parenting practices as a mechanism for bullying prevention are discussed.</p>

<p>The lack of consent or debriefing in online research has attracted widespread public distrust. How can designers create systems to earn and maintain public trust in large-scale online research? Procedural theories inform processes that enable individuals to make decisions about their participation. Substantive theories focus on the normative judgments that researchers and participants make about specific studies in context. Informed by these theories, we designed Bartleby, a system for debriefing participants and eliciting their views about studies that involved them. We evaluated this system by using it to debrief thousands of participants in a series of observational and experimental studies on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span> and Reddit. We find that Bartleby addresses procedural concerns by creating new opportunities for study participants to exercise <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. We also find that participants use Bartleby to contribute to substantive, value-driven conversations about participant voice and power. We conclude with a critical reflection on the strengths and limitations of reusable software to satisfy values from both procedural and substantive ethical theories.</p>

<p>Because of COVID-19, higher education changed as institutions went remote and students’ mental health was challenged. Rural universities were disproportionately affected because of limited <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> access. The purpose of this study was to investigate the psychological need satisfaction/frustration and mental health among rural college students during this pandemic.Six hundred ninety-eight students (Mage = 22.15 ± 2.55) at a rural South-eastern university were recruited.Participants completed a survey examining stress, anxiety, need satisfaction/frustration and previous experience with online courses.Anxiety, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and competence frustration were found to predict 60% of the variance of stress. Another regression analysis found stress, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness frustration to predict 70% of the anxiety variance.Students are frustrated due to the lack of control and restrictions affecting their social interaction. Understanding the relationship between need satisfaction/frustration and mental health can aid university administration in developing interventions that address rural students’ needs.</p>

A total of 287 (102 female and 185 male) Chinese university students reported on their perceived parenting styles, psychological needs, and behavior regulation. Results showed that basic psychological need satisfaction was positively associated with parental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support and autonomous regulation of learning; need frustration was positively correlated with parental psychological control and dysregulation in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> engagement. More importantly, psychological need frustration was a mediator of the relation between parental psychological control and dysregulation in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> engagement. Our findings suggest that students living in an <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive familial environment tend to have satisfied psychological needs as well as autonomous learning behavior. Impairment of psychological needs could be one of the mechanisms through which psychologically controlling parenting was linked to dysregulation of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use in Chinese culture.</p>

<p>Applying an integrated theoretical model consisting of the socioecological theory, the self-determination theory, and the broaden-and-build theory, the present study tested a moderated mediation model of parental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support, filial piety, and gratitude to study how these factors are jointly related to pathological <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use (PIU) in Chinese undergraduate students. A total of 1054 Chinese undergraduate students (M age = 20.35, SD = 1.00, 34.7% females) aged between 16 and 24 years participated in this study. They were instructed to complete self-reported questionnaires on parental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support, filial piety, gratitude, and PIU. The results showed that parental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support was negatively associated with PIU, and filial piety partially mediated this relation. Specifically, parental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support was positively related to filial piety, which, in turn, was negatively associated with PIU. In addition, gratitude moderated the first path of the indirect relation and the direct relation of this mediation effect. To be specific, undergraduate students with higher gratitude showed high filial piety and low PIU, in the context of low parental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support, than those with lower gratitude. Taken together, the current study contributes to extant research by highlighting the vital role of parental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support in mitigating undergraduate students’ PIU and illustrating how filial piety explains the underlying mechanism of this association. This study also provides novel insights into intervention or prevention programs by demonstrating that gratitude alleviates the adverse effect of low parental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support on students’ PIU.</p>

<p>Adorno and Bourdieu share the same interest in developing theoretical and methodological tools of a sociology of cultural forms. In this article, I argue that the main goal of both thinkers is to investigate ways to overcome internal and purely formal interpretations without falling into vulgar sociological explanations that reduce cultural forms to external social context. In line with the thesis of “priority of mediation” of his negative dialectics, Adorno develops a meta-critical style of interpretation based on establishing formal analogies between different fields which abolishes the illusion of absolute <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of cultural forms while acknowledging their truth contents. In his reflexive sociological critique, Bourdieu aims to reveal social and political implications of cultural forms without reducing them to external social context by building homologies between different fields. I try to reveal the common aspects of these critical methods through the Heidegger critiques of two thinkers. I also try to show that the dialectical critiques of rationality of them echo each other in aiming to reach an understanding of reason free from domination and symbolic violence by revealing the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>tions of reason that embodied in cultural fields.</p>

<p>The aim of this preregistered study was to identify dispositional predictors of podcast listening and examine the associations between aspects of podcast listening, dispositional predictors, and psychological outcomes. Three hundred and six adults from a range of countries completed an online questionnaire that assessed individual difference predictors (the Big Five personality factors, curiosity, need for cognition, need to belong, age, and gender), aspects of podcast listening (amount, format, setting, device, and social aspects), and potential outcomes (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, relatedness, meaning, mindfulness, and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> addiction). As predicted, openness to experience, interest-based curiosity, and need for cognition positively predicted podcast listening. Contrary to predictions, need to belong negatively predicted podcast listening, and time spent listening to podcasts was not associated with <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, relatedness, meaning, mindfulness, or <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> addiction. However, certain aspects of podcast listening (e.g., parasocial relationships and social engagement) were related to positive outcomes and to our predictor variables. Furthermore, neuroticism negatively predicted podcast listening. Overall, the findings support the idea that informational motives can play a role in podcast listening, and that some aspects of listening are associated with positive outcomes.</p>

<p>The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) has changed traditional methods of value co-creation. Diverging from traditional methods, this study discusses the influencing factors of AI-supported consumer value co-creation from the perspective of human-to-non-human interactions. This study adopts the stimulus–organism–response framework with consumer engagement (CE) as the intermediary to explore the impact of consumers’ personal subjective factors, community factors, and perceptions of AI technology on their value co-creating behaviors. Data were collected from 528 respondents from the Huawei Huafen Club, Xiaomi BBS, Apple China Virtual Brand, Micro<span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile Phone</span>, and Lenovo communities. SPSS Amos software was used for statistical analysis, revealing that perceived personalization, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, community identity, trust in AI, and self-efficacy are motivational factors that have significant effects on consumer value co-creation behaviors, in which CE plays a significant intermediary role. Our study contributes to the literature on consumer value co-creation supported by AI technology. We also offer important insights for developers of AI-enabled products and service managers.</p>

<p>The present study identifies and discusses the impact of personality factors on remote workers in China, using a phenomenological methodology to understand participants’ lived experiences. The sample population is comprised of Chinese citizens born in China. Data were collected through one-on-one, online semi-structured interviews using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">WeChat</span>. The interview questions are structured to allow participants to explain personality traits found in productive and unproductive remote workers. In addition, the questions explore traits positively associated with developing trust and how the psychological needs of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competency, and relatedness impact remote workers. After data collection, the data were analyzed and coded to develop themes used to answer the core research questions. This study’s findings offer benefits to companies using remote workers and employees new to remote work or those aiming to become remote workers since the data collected provides a holistic picture of remote work from actual workers’ perspective. The information gathered from the research participants allowed the researcher to determine that one of the most beneficial aspects of remote work is <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and the ability to set one’s schedule. Confidence directly impacts feelings of competency among remote workers, and relatedness is negatively impacted by being a remote worker because of decreased opportunities for face-to-face interactions.</p>

<p>Generation Z adolescents as a group of individuals who know <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> technology from an early age have a different <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> from the previous generations. The <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> experienced by generation Z adolescents is followed by behavior that is difficult to understand and sometimes misinterpreted as rebellion, for example disagreeing with their parents and doing things without the help of their parents anymore. Based on this phenomenon, this study aims to analyze the meaning of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for generation Z adolescents. This study uses a qualitative approach with phenomenological methods. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and then analyzed using the Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) technique on four adolescents (19-21 years). Based on the results of the analysis obtained the meaning of independence for generation Z adolescents, namely: (1) efforts to reduce intervention / assistance from parents; (2) differing views with parents; (3) accept the opportunity of parents to make decisions; and (4) the initiative to build work experience.</p>

<p>Use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> creates positive or negative impacts on adolescents. There are a number of factors enabling adolescents to make use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> positively. One of the factors studied in this research is the adolescent worldview. The adolescent worldview greatly determines the way she behaves and her attitude towards <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. The result of this research shows that adolescent worldview may release and enables her to reject negative impacts of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, particularly from modern culturalisms as relativism, individualism, emotionalism, presentism (present-time ism), materialism, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, victimism, and turn it into a positive impact on herself. Worldviews may be differentiated based on three categories namely religion, spirituality and secularity. This research is conducted by explorative-qualitative approach, using case study research method. Data collection process was conducted by in-depth interview with late adolescents.</p>

<p>The relevance of the study is determined by the need to develop programs for psychological correction and prevention of violations of parent-child relationships in families raising adolescents with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction. In the conditions of modern society, there is a steady trend towards an increase in the number of children and adolescents with a tendency to addictive behavior. Parent-child relations, the image of a parent in adolescents with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction has certain specific features. Materials and methods. The research uses the following methods: “<span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction scale” (Chen) (Chen <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction Scale – CIAS), adapted by V.L. Malygina, K.A. Feklisova; questionnaire “Adolescents about parents” (ADOR) E. Schafer, modified by Z. Mateychek, P. Richan, adapted by L.I. Wasserman, I.A. Gorkova and E.E. Romitsyna. The research was carried out in educational institutions of the Sverdlovsk region. The sample size is 167 adolescents (average age – 15.7 years, with S = 0.36). Research results. The results of the study confirm the existence of significantly significant differences in parent’s image among adolescents with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction and adolescents without a tendency to addictive behavior. The revealed differences are associated with the perception of the image of parents both from the content side, which includes the degree of approval, understanding, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and from the structural side, reflecting educational strategies, methods of upbringing and the attitude of parents. Thus, adolescents with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction believe that their mothers show less “positive interest” in the events of their lives than adolescents without <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction (t = -9.06; at p &lt;0.001); less often reproduce <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (t = -3.41; at p &lt;0.001); more often inclined to directivity (t = 7.92; at p &lt;0.001) and hostility (t = 8.68; at p &lt;0.001), inconsistent in their educational influences (t = 4.12; at p &lt;0.001). Adolescents with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction pay more attention to hostile and distant parental attitudes (t = 7.64; at p &lt;0.001), focusing on the negative behavior of the adolescent (t = -6.82; at p &lt;0.001); the educational strategy is perceived by adolescents as predominantly inconsistent (t = 2.23; at p &lt;0.001) and directive (t = 4.50; at p &lt;0.001). These differences, according to the authors, are associated with both the characteristics of the parent, as well as with the psychological properties of the personality, prone to addictive behavior. The scientific novelty of the research lies in the fact that in Russian psychology, for the first time, a study has been undertaken of the characteristics of the parent’s image in adolescents who differ in the degree of their propensity to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction.</p>

<p>Quality of life (QOL) is lower for transition-age autistic youth compared to typically developing counterparts. Leisure-time pursuits have been linked to higher quality of life in the general population and among autistic adults. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore leisure-time use among transition-age autistic youth. Youth ages 18–23 years were recruited through universities and organizations that serve the autistic population and their families across the United States. Participants took photos of their leisure-time activities over a 7-day period using their own <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s. They were then interviewed via Zoom using a semi-structured interview guide that was based on the Self-Determination Theory framework and the Iwasaki leisure-time model. Data were analyzed using directed qualitative content analysis based on the theoretical framework. Eighteen young autistic adults participated in the study (nine male, five female, three agender/non-binary, and one transgender). Solitary, screen-based activities were most common. Major themes were that activities contributed positively to a sense of achievement and a sense of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and there were few major barriers to favored activities. While most activities were done alone, rather than describing these activities as isolating, activities helped participants cope with stress. Participants gained a sense of connection when they were engaged in leisure activities with others who shared common interests. Results suggest that appropriate interventions may support youth in choosing activities they most enjoy, even if they appear to be solitary or sedentary, and to help ensure that youth are gaining maximal benefits from these activities. • Few studies have examined leisure-time use among transition-age autistic youth. • Youth effectively shared experiences using participant-driven photo-elicitation. • Results suggest leisure activities contribute to well-being.</p>

<p>Adolescents are spending significant time online. Consequently, concerns are consistently raised about potential negative impacts on their mental health. Potentially, these concerns minimise their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and reify the construction of the vulnerable adolescent. Using template analysis, we explored adolescents’ perspectives ( N = 54) of the relationship between <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and mental health. We centrally considered the wide array of uses made of different <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> by the participants, focusing on their understandings of the potentially positive effects these might have. Focus group discussions showed <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> could be used to reduce stress, have value for social connectivity, were an important source of information about mental health, and provided a platform for peer-to-peer support. Our conclusion indicated adolescents are generally socially competent online and are often experimenting with their emergent sense of agency.</p>

<p>Memories of rejection contribute to feeling lonely. However, high-quality listening that conveys well-meaning attention and understanding when speakers discuss social rejection may help them to reconnect. Speakers may experience less loneliness because they feel close and connected (relatedness) to the listener and because listening supports self-congruent expression (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>). Five experiments (total N = 1,643) manipulated listening during visualized (Studies 1, 4, 5) and actual (Studies 2, 3) conversations. We used different methods (video vignettes; in-person; <span style="background-color:lightgreen">computer-mediated</span>; recall; written scenarios) to compare high-quality with regular (all studies) and poor (Study 1) listening. Findings across studies showed that high-quality listening reduced speakers’ state loneliness after they shared past experiences of social rejection. Parallel mediation analyses indicated that both feeling related to the listener and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> satisfaction (particularly its self-congruence component; Study 5) mediated the effect of listening on loneliness. These results provide novel insights into the hitherto unexplored effect of listening on state loneliness.</p>

<p>According to current concepts of developmental tasks, both the use of digital media and the consumption of psychotropic substances are age-typical challenges for adolescents. The majority overcomes these developmental tasks, but a substantial proportion of youth develops problematic usage patterns (e.g., of video games) or problematic consumption behavior (e.g., of alcohol). Empirical findings show the importance of family aspects for these problematic behavior patterns. Currently, it is not clear which specific areas of parent-child relationship are associated in each case and whether there are differences between substance-related and substance-unrelated problematic behavioral patterns.We surveyed 480 adolescents (45.2% females, mean age = 16.84 years) with standardized instruments regarding the mother-child relationship as well as problematic gaming, problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use, and problematic alcohol use. We conducted correlation and multiple linear regression analyses (separately for problematic gaming, problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use, and problematic alcohol use) as well as a multivariate multiple regression analysis.In the regression analyses, more conflicts with the mother were related to all three behavioral patterns. However, lower cohesion was only statistically significantly associated with problematic alcohol use, but not with problematic gaming and problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use, whereas lower <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and more frequent punishment of the child were statistically significantly related to problematic gaming and problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use, but not to problematic alcohol use.The findings indicate partially different relational dynamics for substance-related and substance-unrelated problem behaviors (interestingly, for cohesion and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, the 95% confidence intervals of the standardized regression coefficients were not overlapping). The results of the present study could be used in family-based prevention approaches or in treatments in the clinical setting.</p>

<p>Studies on self-determination theory (SDT) have placed satisfaction of basic psychological needs (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, relatedness, and competence) at the core of well-being, whereas frustration of these needs results in multiple potentially unhealthy mental and behavioral patterns. This study analyzed how need satisfaction and frustration relate to the severity of gambling and gaming problems.A survey study with 18-75-year-old Finnish participants (N = 1530; 50.33% male) was conducted in April 2021. Basic psychological needs were measured with the Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction and Frustration Scale, mental health issues with the five-item Mental Health Inventory, gambling problems with the Problem Gambling Severity Index, and gaming problems with the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> Gaming Disorder Test. Zero-inflated negative binomial analyses were conducted to examine how satisfaction and frustration of basic psychological needs, together with mental health issues, are associated with gaming and gambling problems.Mental health issues were associated with gambling and gaming problems, but this association became nonsignificant when basic psychological needs were added to the model. However, better mental health still was associated with the absence of gaming problems. While need satisfaction had no association with the absence of gaming or gambling problems, need frustration was associated with increases in the severity of both gaming and gambling problems.Frustration of basic psychological needs for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, relatedness, and competence is associated with both gambling and gaming problems and should be considered when developing treatment and support for those who experience such problems.</p>

<p>The psychic transformations the teenager is subjected to are generated by the needs and requirements he experiences, not only by the puberty needs, which take other forms now, but also by the needs emerging at this level of growth. In this article we will talk about the emotional needs of the teenagers, related to the online environment and we will consider both constructive behavior and what parents should avoid in their relationship to their children. Teenagers’ connection to their own emotional needs (safety, belonging, empathy and honesty, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, trust, spontaneity, etc.) as well as the involvement of the parents in gratifying them reflects in the degree of vitality and well-being of the child. Apart from the undeniable benefits, the development of the technology and the accessibility of the online environment also draw undesirable consequences which can lead to major damage of psychic, social and school functioning. It is essential for the parents to be present in their teenagers’ life, be available and informed about the age characteristics, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> traps, ways of preventing the risks in the online, influencing and maintaining their children’s excitement and joy, as well as spontaneity and innocence.</p>

<p>Since <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s are getting cheaper, sophisticated, and multifunctional, there are opportunities for learners to engage in more meaningful English language learning. This study employs a mixed-method research design, with the purpose of identifying the use of English language apps outside the classroom and depicting students’ English language apps use behaviour i.e.&nbsp;motivation from the Self-Determination Theory (SDT). The findings show that students use the apps related to grammar the most and followed by English apps related to speaking, reading and, vocabulary. Findings also reveal students in this study display three types of motivation from the perspective of SDT i.e.&nbsp;<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness. Based on the findings, a model of Pedagogical Considerations of Using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Smartphone</span> for English Language Learning (PCUSELL) is suggested. As a conclusion, the authors suggests that educators in higher educational institution educators should consider the potential of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> English apps in their teaching and learning activities, particularly in this new normal of teaching and learning i.e.&nbsp;epoch of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

Abstract
</h2>
<h3 class="anchored">
Objective
</h3>
Grounded in the self-determination theory (SDT), this study aimed to examine the real-time associations between basic psychological need satisfaction and motivation underpinning daily activity participation among stroke survivors.
<h3 class="anchored">
Design
</h3>
Repeated-measures observational study involving seven days of ambulatory monitoring; participants completed ecological momentary assessment (EMA) surveys via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s eight times daily. Multilevel models were used to analyze EMA data for concurrent (same survey) and lagged (next survey) associations.
<h3 class="anchored">
Setting
</h3>
General community.
<h3 class="anchored">
Participants
</h3>
Forty community-dwelling stroke survivors.
<h3 class="anchored">
Interventions
</h3>
Not applicable.
<h3 class="anchored">
Main Outcome Measure
</h3>
EMA measures of basic psychological needs (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, relatedness) and motivation (autonomous motivation, controlled motivation).
<h3 class="anchored">
Results
</h3>
In concurrent analyses, increased <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (B=0.21, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.26, p&lt;0.001), competence (B=0.10, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.19, p=0.021), and relatedness (B=0.10, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.13, p&lt;0.001) were momentarily associated with higher autonomous motivation. Conversely, increased <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (B=-0.19, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.10, p&lt;0.001) and competence (B=-0.09, 95% CI -0.17 to -0.01, p=0.020) were momentarily associated with lower controlled motivation. Contrary to SDT, increased relatedness was momentarily associated with higher controlled motivation (B=0.10, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.14, p&lt;0.001). In lagged analyses, no momentary associations were detected between basic psychological needs and motivation (ps&gt;0.05).
<h3 class="anchored">
Conclusions
</h3>
<p>Findings suggest that basic psychological need satisfaction is momentarily associated with motivation for daily activity participation. Additional research is warranted to examine the associations of different orientations of relatedness with autonomous and controlled motivation. Supporting basic psychological needs may foster stroke survivors’ autonomous motivation to enhance daily activity participation following stroke.</p>

<p>This study examines fitness app use patterns and their correlates among Chinese users from the perspectives of uses and gratification theory and self-determination theory. Our sample comprised 632 users of WeRun, the fitness plugin of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">WeChat</span>, the largest Chinese mobile social networking app; participants completed an online survey and provided self-tracked physical activity data, which were subjected to latent class analysis. Based on the four-class latent class model (which yielded the best model fit and the most interpretable results), 30.5%, 27.5%, 24.7%, and 17.3% of the users were categorized as light users, reward-oriented users, lifestyle-oriented users, and interaction-oriented users, respectively. Moreover, class membership was associated with gender, age, education, income, life satisfaction, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and platform-based motivations. There is a significant heterogeneity in fitness app use and exercise behaviors. Platform-based motivations and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> are important classification factors, as users are looking for specific kinds of gratification from their use of fitness apps. Demographics and individual characteristics are also explanatory factors for class membership. The study findings suggest that fitness app designers should segment users based on motivation and gratification.</p>

<p>Research has extensively studied the negative effects of digital communication on adolescents’ well-being. However, positive digital experiences and behavior in adolescence are still poorly understood. The recently developed Digital Flourishing Scale addresses this gap and focuses on the positive perceptions of a user’s experiences and behaviors in digital communication among adults. In this paper, we developed an adolescent version of this scale. Study 1 demonstrated the internal consistency of the scale and the same factor structure for adolescence as for adulthood: connectedness, civil participation, positive social comparison, authentic self-presentation, and self-control. Study 2 confirmed the identified factor structure with a second sample of adolescents and established measurement invariance across genders. The construct validity of the scale was confirmed by investigating associations with related constructs, including the basic psychological needs from self-determination theory (competence, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and relatedness), secure attachment to a close friend, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> aggression, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>-induced inspiration, authenticity of posted positive content, and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> self-control failure. The results indicated that not all adolescents flourish equally online. Differences occurred depending on the adolescents’ gender and socioeconomic status. The paper concludes that the newly developed scale is a valid and reliable measure for assessing adolescents’ perceptions of digital thriving and digital empowerment.</p>
