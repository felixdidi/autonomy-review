<p>Abstract Introduction: The number of two-to three-year-old children using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s was 10% in 2013 compared to 40% in 2017 (Konok, Bunford, &amp; Miklósi, 2020). Several theoretical and empirical studies deal with the didactics of using modern technology in the classroom. Most studies highlight the neutral (Zsolnai, 2017) or positive impact of using ICT in the classroom. Only a few address the negative effects of digitally enhanced learning (Dávila, Casabayó, &amp; Rayburn, 2018; Livingstone, 2012; Lorenzo &amp; Trujillo, 2018). State education has continually tried to integrate modern technology with education, but there are also examples of institutional restrictions on its use and even a total ban can also be found. Purpose: This study provides an overview of the pedagogical and epistemological reasons why Waldorf pedagogy and Waldorf Steiner schools take a critical approach to the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICT) and to “screens” in general, together with mapping out the current state of Waldorf schools in Hungary. Methods: In the present study, we applied source analysis as a traditional research method in the philosophy of education. Conclusions: The findings show that the institutional use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies entirely contradicts the basis, tasks and spirit of Waldorf pedagogy. If we look at the epistemology and anthroposophical anthropology of Waldorf pedagogy, we can see that the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of a Waldorf teacher is not limitless, and so a continuous practical and theoretical responsibility of the Waldorf movement and Waldorf teachers is to establish and uphold coherence between the practices of every Waldorf institution and Waldorf pedagogy.</p>

<p>Aim: This study aims to describe rehabilitation nurses’ perspectives on the complexity of and intention to use an innovative device for post-infarction patients. Design: The research employed a qualitative method, with a video demonstration,Â and analysis provided by the participants. To guide the study, the Technology Acceptance Model was used in order to measure perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Methods: Focus Groups were used to collect nurses’ perspectivesÂ on the developed device. Recruitment followed a snowball sampling method. Eligible participants received an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> with anÂ informed consent form. Privacy and confidentiality were maintained throughout. Content analysis was performed using ATLAS.ti v7, with Bardin’s technique, i.e., an a posteriori categorical organization. Results: Three categories were identified as relevant to the study objectives: “Therapeutic adherence and motivation”; “Home and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the patient and caregiver”; and “Factors that facilitate the practice of the rehabilitation nurse”. Participants felt that the innovation and technological complexity of the device might help to increase patient motivation and adherence, which would be of great use to rehabilitation nurses, allowing better intervention development. Conclusion: Participants perceived the device as useful toÂ practice, and beneficial to post-infarction patients. Interestingly, the complexity inherent to the device is regarded as a factor that may increase motivation and adherence.</p>

<p>Adolescent <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> gaming addiction (IGA) has become a serve public health problem, particularly in China. Despite the fact that the school climate has a significant impact on teenage IGA, little research has looked into the underlying mediating processes. This cross-sectional study looked at the impact of adolescents’ perceptions of their school climate (including teacher-student support, student-student support, and opportunities for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>) on IGA in a sample of 1053 Chinese adolescents (Meanage = 13.52 years; 52.4% females) using convenient sampling methodology, as well as whether deviant peer affiliation mediated this association. Adolescents’ school climate, IGA, and deviant peer affiliation were examined using the School Climate Questionnaire, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> Gaming Addiction Scale, and two validated tools in this study. The results showed that teacher-student support and student-student support were both negatively associated with IGA, and that these correlations were mediated by deviant peer affiliation. The implications of these findings are discussed.</p>

<p>Teachers are expected to encourage students to be active in the learning process in line with social-constructivist principles. However, when it comes to their own learning, they are obliged to attend activities organized by their institution. Triggered by this dilemma, this study introduced <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Computer-Mediated</span> Communication as an alternative to the top-down delivery of trainer-fronted professional development and explored teachers’ uptake of Web 2.0 in the pre-pandemic era. To obtain comprehensive insights into teachers’ perceptions related to the use of Web 2.0 for their own learning, the study employed qualitative and quantitative methodology. Study results revealed that teacher development cannot be promoted with the use of Web 2.0 per se as it is very much dependent on teacher awareness, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, beliefs, contextual realities but most significantly student learning. Despite limitations, this study highlights the principle of learner-centeredness as the key for promoting teacher development and the need to make prospective teacher learning practices an integral part of student-focused activity. Based on the results of the study, it is recommended that the multi-dimensional nature of teacher learning and contextual realities at multiple levels are considered in the design of post-pandemic teacher development schemes, significantly in institutions with low-<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> cultures in order to turn top-down teacher development practices which teachers are used to into teacher initiated bottom-up learning processes.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) is being immersed in people’s daily lives at an increasingly younger age. It has been key for adolescents to pursue distance education, and their use and mastery of technological means and tools with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> access has increased. In this study, the motivation, specifically in the interest, digital competence, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and social interaction, generated by ICTs in the daily lives of adolescents during the pandemic caused by COVID-19 was analyzed. In the study, the objective was to study the motivation, use and commitment generated by ICTs in these students in relation to their gender and age after their confinement to the classroom caused by the first wave of incoming students. An experimental method of descriptive and correlative design was used along with a quantitative method to analyze the data. The data were obtained in the year 2020 through a validated questionnaire committed to the ICT scale used by PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment). A total of 924 students from the sixth grade of primary education in the autonomous city of Ceuta (Spain), aged between 10 and 13, participated in the sample. The results reveal that the motivation and commitment to ICT in these age groups were medium in relation to the total mean of results on a Likert-5 scale. Boys scored higher in all the variables analyzed, and both age and gender show correlations, in addition to the factor of prediction. In conclusion, students in the sixth year of primary education, after the confinement period, were medium-high in their use and engagement of ICT. In addition, gender and age affected ICT use and engagement.</p>

<p>We review the progress in developing a science of interdependence applied to the determinations and perceptions of risk for autonomous human–machine systems based on a case study of the Department of Defense’s (DoD) faulty determination of risk in a drone strike in Afghanistan; the DoD’s assessment was rushed, suppressing alternative risk perceptions. We begin by contrasting the lack of success found in a case study from the commercial sphere (<span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>’s use of machine intelligence to find and categorize “hate speech”). Then, after the DoD case study, we draw a comparison with the Department of Energy’s (DOE) mismanagement of its military nuclear wastes that created health risks to the public, DOE employees, and the environment. The DOE recovered by defending its risk determinations and challenging risk perceptions in public. We apply this process to autonomous human–machine systems. The result from this review is a major discovery about the costly suppression of risk perceptions to best determine actual risks, whether for the military, business, or politics. For autonomous systems, we conclude that the determinations of actual risks need to be limited in scope as much as feasible; and that a process of free and open debate needs to be adopted that challenges the risk perceptions arising in situations facing uncertainty as the best, and possibly the only, path forward to a solution.</p>

<p>Purpose Companies that leverage the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>-of-things (IoT) will gain significant competitive advantages over the competition; however, few businesses have active IoT initiatives. This paper aims to provide principles to guide executives as they launch or scale-up IoT initiatives. Design/methodology/approach This paper draws upon data from original expert interviews and an extensive study of existing scholarly literature, management publications and white papers from leading strategy and technology firms. Findings Close cooperation among a company’s operations, business strategy and information technology units creates a trifecta of skills, vision and budgeting that can successfully bring major IoT initiatives to fruition. Unfortunately, many companies face a misalignment among these departments. The way to overcome this misalignment is to create a cross-functional team dedicated to IoT initiatives. Leaders should build these teams on the principles of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, rational compensation, equality and diversity. Practical implications This paper provides strategic advice for business leaders as well as four guiding principles with which to execute their IoT strategies. Originality/value Much of the writing about IoT advocates initiatives by teaching about the many business benefits of IoT or provides a use case for a specific type of IoT technology. This paper focuses on removing a major obstacle faced by many business leaders who want to embrace the IoT but find themselves unable to do so.</p>

<p>The paper demonstrates the feasibility of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICT) in English as a foreign language (EFL) teaching and learning process. The organizational and pedagogical approaches to efficient EFL learning in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic have been outlined. Furthermore, the main perspectives and challenges appearing in an online learning environment have been characterized. The proposed paper aims to consider the possibility of integrating innovative computer technologies into online foreign language learning to foster students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and boost their language proficiency. The findings suggest that using ICT is beneficial for mastering a foreign language in out-of-class settings. Admittedly, there is no perfect or universal blend that may suit all the EFL learning environments. Therefore, it is claimed that blended programs should be created for each academic course regarding students’ wants, needs, and abilities. Furthermore, each higher educational institution needs to have a strategy for designing and implementing a distance EFL learning program that considers instructional, pedagogical, and technological factors.</p>

<p>Adorno and Bourdieu share the same interest in developing theoretical and methodological tools of a sociology of cultural forms. In this article, I argue that the main goal of both thinkers is to investigate ways to overcome internal and purely formal interpretations without falling into vulgar sociological explanations that reduce cultural forms to external social context. In line with the thesis of “priority of mediation” of his negative dialectics, Adorno develops a meta-critical style of interpretation based on establishing formal analogies between different fields which abolishes the illusion of absolute <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of cultural forms while acknowledging their truth contents. In his reflexive sociological critique, Bourdieu aims to reveal social and political implications of cultural forms without reducing them to external social context by building homologies between different fields. I try to reveal the common aspects of these critical methods through the Heidegger critiques of two thinkers. I also try to show that the dialectical critiques of rationality of them echo each other in aiming to reach an understanding of reason free from domination and symbolic violence by revealing the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>tions of reason that embodied in cultural fields.</p>

<p>This mixed methods study examines the way online resources can be effective in developing the learning <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> metacognitive skills of planning, monitoring, and self-evaluation among undergraduate students at the Facultyof Letters and Humanities Fes-Agdal, which is representative of the socio-cultural and higher education system of Morocco. The sample consisted of an experimental group and a control group. The experimental group consisted of 120 students who were exposed to three main online tools (Newsela.com, mrnussbaum.com, and rewordify.com), with virtual meetings and instruction provided through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>. The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> groups were kept secret, with only participants joining. The control group consisted of 120 students that benefited only from the university’s regular reading courses. The experimental intervention period was followed by interviews with a sample of 25 students from both groups, providing a qualitative perspective. The overall results suggest that online resources have a positive effect on the development of metacognitive skills. Students tend to appreciate the inclusion of online resources in the classroom without devaluing the role of their EFL teacher – the students did not expect online resources to fully replace the role of their teachers.Keywords: EFL online learning <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>; learning <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>; online resources; teaching and learning in higher education</p>

<p>Writing is a complex language skill, and writing using English as a medium for employment purposes requires an intricate set of knowledge and skills. Because such a writing process frequently occurs outside of a formal learning setting, few attempts to study the phenomenon have been made. Through the lens of the activity theory, the paper analyses the influence of six components in a CV writing process from a social-constructivist approach. A mixed-method approach was adopted with a Likert scale survey with open-ended questions and semi-structured interviews. Quantitative data from 184 participants revealed that students were mostly influenced by various digital artifacts (e.g., online dictionaries, online courses) and situated in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>ies of learning. Qualitative results also indicate the prominent challenges relating to syntax and lexical use as one the conflicting factors and a certain level of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> as a facilitating factor while they managed to overcome these complications. The paper suggests how the curriculum of Business English could be adapted to support language learners in real-life employment situations.</p>

<p>China<code>s Belt and Road Initiative is a massive infrastructural project that Ethiopia is encompassed. Yet, in Ethiopia, public opinion over the subject has never been homogenous as there are both apparent faiths that the initiative would positively contribute to Ethiopia’s economy, and suspicions that it is merely China</code>s veiled ambition to accelerate its expansion in global economy and politics, intensifying the concerns that China will not be any different from former colonial powers for African nations. Besides mainstream media coverage, much of the debate over this initiative has increasingly happened on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s as attributable to their relative accessibility and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.

In this article, we suggest a valuation approach towards <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> practices in later life that explores <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> practices not as “use” or “non-use,” but rather asks which forms of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> practices are valued in later life, and which ones are de-valued. For this valuog­raphy, we draw upon different data sources, including interviews with older adults, to explore the multiple “goods” and “bads” through which <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use in later life gets valued. The findings suggest two registers of value: <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and innovation. Valued <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> practices in later life are therefore done by an autonomous, older individual and include innovative technologies. We conclude that a performative, reflexive, and value-oriented understanding of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> practices sheds light on the “<span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> Multiple,” or the many different shapes the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> takes in older people’s lives that go beyond a “use” and “non-use” binary.</p>

<p>With the update of educational concepts and the continuous enrichment of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> learning resources and platforms, the concept of “learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>” has been widely promoted and applied, and learners’ personalized learning methods and needs have been met. However, due to the differences in learners’ autonomous learning ability, their learning effects are also different. Combined with the practice of college English teaching in our school, the author tries to explore the problems of “learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>” and put forward some corresponding teaching strategies.</p>

<p>With the continuous development of science and technology, network technology has become more and more advanced and network applications are widely used in all walks of life, and vocal music teaching is no exception. The Intelligent Agent plays a unique role in networked teaching by making up for the lack of intelligence, adaptiveness, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and interoperability and interactivity in all aspects of traditional teaching. This paper introduces the knowledge of Intelligent Agent and then discusses its application in the networked teaching environment. Compared with the traditional teaching environment, the intelligent network teaching environment is more conducive to the initiative and innovation of students, reflecting the characteristics of student-centred learning and achieving a variety of functions such as teaching resource sharing, information interaction, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communication</span>, and distance learning with the support of computer network technology. It is a new field to be explored, especially opening up a new chapter of online vocal music teaching.</p>

<p>In recent years, transportation, medical care, energy, and other fields have relied on a number of smart technologies such as the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things and cloud computing, and the degree of intelligence has continued to increase. As a key part of the future development of cities, education is facing tremendous pressure and challenges. How to use all kinds of smart technologies to promote the informatization of education and create a new era of smarter education is an important mission of current smart education. Decision tree classification is a frequently used technique in data mining. It has the characteristics of fast classification and high efficiency. It is not only used to analyze data but also to make predictions. Professional art education occupies an important position in college education. How to combine decision tree algorithms to develop targeted and effective professional art education and to strengthen the teaching reform and research method innovation of art design has become the current teaching work of colleges and universities. The purpose of this paper is to optimize the teaching mode of art courses in colleges and universities, improve the teaching effect of art classes, and realize the teaching goal of art courses. In this paper, art curriculum teaching experience and the reality of teaching research, through analyzing three local questionnaire surveys of college students, based on the principle of students’ subjectivity from the topic content, organization form, evaluation mode of college art teaching in our student <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, initiative, and the role of creative mechanisms are discussed. According to the practical teaching activities of art courses conducted in this paper, the satisfaction degree of college students with art courses is up to 92%, which indicates that this experiment is still relatively successful and significant, and arouses students’ subjectivity to some extent.</p>

<p>The development of predictive algorithms for personalized recommendations that prioritize ads, filter content, and tailor our decision-making processes will increasingly impact our society in the upcoming years. One example of what this future might hold was recently presented by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> Reality Labs (FRL) who work on augmented reality (AR) glasses powered by contextually aware AI that allows the user to “communicate, navigate, learn, share, and take action in the world” (<span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> Reality Labs 2021). A major feature of those glasses is “the intelligent click” that presents action prompts to the user based on their personal history and previous choices. The user can accept or decline those suggested action prompts depending on individual preferences. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>/Meta presents this technology as a gateway to “increased agency”. However, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>’s claim presumes a simplistic view of agency according to which our agentive capacities increase parallel to the ease in which our actions are carried out. Technologies that structure people’s lives need to be based on a deeper understanding of agency that serves as the conceptual basis in which predictive algorithms are developed. With the goal of mapping this emerging terrain, the aim of this paper is to offer a thorough analysis of the agency-limiting risks and the agency-enhancing potentials of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>’s “intelligent click” feature. Based on a concept of agency by Dignum (Responsible Artificial Intelligence: How to Develop and Use AI in a Responsible Way. Springer International Publishing, Cham, 2019), the three agential dimensions of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (acting independently), adaptability (reacting to changes in the environment), and interactivity (interacting with other agents) are analyzed towards our ability to make self-determining choices.</p>

<p>Saudi EFL learners have been traditionally described as non-autonomous. During the coronavirus pandemic, Saudi universities shifted to online education. Scholars maintain that online education by its very nature enhances learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The current study, that was conducted after students received three semesters of online education, aimed to explore the effect of the shift to online education on Saudi college EFL learners’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. It also investigated gender differences in learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Both quantitative data by means of a self-report questionnaire (N=306) and qualitative data by means of a semi-structured online interview (N=20) were collected and analyzed. Quantitative data revealed that Saudi college EFL learners are autonomous (with a total mean of 4.02 out of 5). This mean is much higher than the means obtained in studies conducted before the shift to online education. Females outperformed males in just one dimension of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, autonomous learning enjoyment. No gender differences were found in the other dimensions of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> or total learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Qualitative data analysis indicated that students attributed to online education improvement in five important aspects of their learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, namely, goal setting and organization of study time, the use of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> as learning resources, the use of performance feedback, self-assessment and computer skills. An aspect that witnessed some improvement but still has room for much improvement is reflection on learning.&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Article visualizations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=“/-counters-/edu_01/0926/a.php” alt=“Hit counter” /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>The aim of this preregistered study was to identify dispositional predictors of podcast listening and examine the associations between aspects of podcast listening, dispositional predictors, and psychological outcomes. Three hundred and six adults from a range of countries completed an online questionnaire that assessed individual difference predictors (the Big Five personality factors, curiosity, need for cognition, need to belong, age, and gender), aspects of podcast listening (amount, format, setting, device, and social aspects), and potential outcomes (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, relatedness, meaning, mindfulness, and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> addiction). As predicted, openness to experience, interest-based curiosity, and need for cognition positively predicted podcast listening. Contrary to predictions, need to belong negatively predicted podcast listening, and time spent listening to podcasts was not associated with <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, relatedness, meaning, mindfulness, or <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> addiction. However, certain aspects of podcast listening (e.g., parasocial relationships and social engagement) were related to positive outcomes and to our predictor variables. Furthermore, neuroticism negatively predicted podcast listening. Overall, the findings support the idea that informational motives can play a role in podcast listening, and that some aspects of listening are associated with positive outcomes.</p>

<p>The definition of consumerism is multifaceted, extending from the consumption of goods and services (which may be perceived as advantageous to the growth of the economy, both localized and global) to its more negative connotations: the obsessive consumption of goods, exploitation of the people who create them and greed. In a society heavily influenced by consumerism, we find ourselves manipulated by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and targeted advertising to buy goods or to cultivate a certain lifestyle, raising important ethical questions about responsibility and our <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to make decisions. How has the nature of how we create and consume goods evolved and how is this linked to moral responsibility and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>? Can it also be argued that there is aesthetic appreciation to be gained from some of the items that we create and consume?</p>

<p>Almost every aspect of a person’s daily life is impacted by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICTs), and some unfavorable outcomes like technostress have been noticed. In this study, we examine how technostress affects knowledge hiding. Drawing from the energy-consuming characteristic of technostress and prior research on how technostress affects ICT users, this article builds and tests a model that takes work exhaustion as a mediator and explored the moderating role of job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. To test our conceptual model, we examined the responses to a survey questionnaire submitted by 287 ICT users from multiple organizations. Using structural equation modeling, we found that technostress increases employees’ knowledge hiding behavior, and work exhaustion partially mediates technostress and knowledge hiding, while job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> only moderates the relationship between technostress and work exhaustion when the fourth factor of technological stress, techno-insecurity, is excluded. We also discuss future research directions and implications of the results.</p>

<p>This study is based on the separation of teachers and learners caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the implication of Moore’s Transactional Distance Theory, which proliferated for nearly 30 years but has been inconsistently validated empirically. The quantitative approach was employed, with questionnaires distributed based on the learners’ perspectives. The subjects of the study include 153 respondents from computer science department of an Indonesian public university. Three key tenets of transactional distance include dialogue, structure, and learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> were specifically addressed and validated as significant predictors in this study. The findings elucidated an inverse relationship between dialogue and learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> respectively with transactional distance, and a less rigid course structure capable of contributing to lessen the perceived degree of transactional distance in the e-learning environment. Furthermore, this study discovered that e-learning satisfaction and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> connection speed had an impact on the extent of transactional distance.</p>

<p>In the article, from the standpoint of the theory of network culture and the concept of «symbolic capital» by P. Bourdieu, the processes taking place in visual art practice under the influence of the development of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> are considered. Contemporary art practices and digital art explore the same symbolic capital from different conceptual positions. For contemporary artistic practice, the critical theory and idea of D. Kossuth about the search for the boundaries of art as such, the study of the socio-cultural reality of the here-and-now, and the formulation of the principles of identity remain the main ones. In digital practices, the focus is on the search for an individual style through the study of the structural features of the artistic language itself, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> from verbal commentary. The presence of these vectors is also associated with the redistribution of power capital under the influence of the development of network culture and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, when the museum and gallery sphere is not able to control all the processes taking place in art practice. Not one of the participants in artistic communication possesses the integrity of power. Networks today have become a platform with their own power and authority. At the same time, rules from offline flow into the virtual environment and new restrictions are created, related both to the ontological features of digital logic and to the work of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>ies.</p>

<p>This study aimed to ascertain vocational EFL teachers’ perspectives on the development of Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL) resources in vocational schools. It employed a mixed-method approach in which data were collected simultaneously using an open-ended questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. The study involved 95 English teachers from vocational schools in two cities of East Java, Indonesia. Among the participants, four were invited to participate in an online interview to discuss their perspectives on the characteristics, use and development of MALL material for vocational students. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics. The analysis results showed that more than half of the respondents agreed that MALL resources were more accessible (65.4%), easier to generate (65.4%) and more successful at improving learners’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (73.1%), compared to traditional materials. Additionally, 40% of teachers thought that MALL materials could be used to promote classroom interaction, and it was much easier for teachers to provide immediate feedback through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>. In summary, 42% of teachers agreed that MALL resources could aid in foreign language acquisition. Due to students’ proximity to technology and mobile devices, teachers recognized that MALL materials can be applied inside and outside the classrooms. Therefore, vocational EFL teachers must be able to develop and implement MALL materials in their classrooms.</p>

<p>Abstract Introduction: The number of two-to three-year-old children using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s was 10% in 2013 compared to 40% in 2017 (Konok, Bunford, &amp; Miklósi, 2020). Several theoretical and empirical studies deal with the didactics of using modern technology in the classroom. Most studies highlight the neutral (Zsolnai, 2017) or positive impact of using ICT in the classroom. Only a few address the negative effects of digitally enhanced learning (Dávila, Casabayó, &amp; Rayburn, 2018; Livingstone, 2012; Lorenzo &amp; Trujillo, 2018). State education has continually tried to integrate modern technology with education, but there are also examples of institutional restrictions on its use and even a total ban can also be found. Purpose: This study provides an overview of the pedagogical and epistemological reasons why Waldorf pedagogy and Waldorf Steiner schools take a critical approach to the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICT) and to “screens” in general, together with mapping out the current state of Waldorf schools in Hungary. Methods: In the present study, we applied source analysis as a traditional research method in the philosophy of education. Conclusions: The findings show that the institutional use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies entirely contradicts the basis, tasks and spirit of Waldorf pedagogy. If we look at the epistemology and anthroposophical anthropology of Waldorf pedagogy, we can see that the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of a Waldorf teacher is not limitless, and so a continuous practical and theoretical responsibility of the Waldorf movement and Waldorf teachers is to establish and uphold coherence between the practices of every Waldorf institution and Waldorf pedagogy.</p>

<p>The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) has changed traditional methods of value co-creation. Diverging from traditional methods, this study discusses the influencing factors of AI-supported consumer value co-creation from the perspective of human-to-non-human interactions. This study adopts the stimulus–organism–response framework with consumer engagement (CE) as the intermediary to explore the impact of consumers’ personal subjective factors, community factors, and perceptions of AI technology on their value co-creating behaviors. Data were collected from 528 respondents from the Huawei Huafen Club, Xiaomi BBS, Apple China Virtual Brand, Micro<span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile Phone</span>, and Lenovo communities. SPSS Amos software was used for statistical analysis, revealing that perceived personalization, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, community identity, trust in AI, and self-efficacy are motivational factors that have significant effects on consumer value co-creation behaviors, in which CE plays a significant intermediary role. Our study contributes to the literature on consumer value co-creation supported by AI technology. We also offer important insights for developers of AI-enabled products and service managers.</p>

<p>The present study identifies and discusses the impact of personality factors on remote workers in China, using a phenomenological methodology to understand participants’ lived experiences. The sample population is comprised of Chinese citizens born in China. Data were collected through one-on-one, online semi-structured interviews using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">WeChat</span>. The interview questions are structured to allow participants to explain personality traits found in productive and unproductive remote workers. In addition, the questions explore traits positively associated with developing trust and how the psychological needs of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competency, and relatedness impact remote workers. After data collection, the data were analyzed and coded to develop themes used to answer the core research questions. This study’s findings offer benefits to companies using remote workers and employees new to remote work or those aiming to become remote workers since the data collected provides a holistic picture of remote work from actual workers’ perspective. The information gathered from the research participants allowed the researcher to determine that one of the most beneficial aspects of remote work is <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and the ability to set one’s schedule. Confidence directly impacts feelings of competency among remote workers, and relatedness is negatively impacted by being a remote worker because of decreased opportunities for face-to-face interactions.</p>

<p>This study draws upon organizational psychology and platform labor research to investigate how socio-psychological factors affect the mental well-being of platform workers and help them cope with the challenges of work. Based on a survey study of 500 food-delivery workers (‘riders’) in China, we provide quantitative evidence of workers’ ambivalent subjective experiences that complements the predominantly qualitative account in the extant literature. In particular, we assess the complex relationships between meaningfulness of work, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> at work, self-perceived competence, and workers’ subjective well-being. Our data also show that the stress-buffering effect of social support mainly comes from the riders’ familial contact and their online group <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> with other workers. Overall, despite the well-documented precarity and stress in platform work, the riders in our sample appear to be able to mobilize inner and relational resources to achieve a relatively high-level mental well-being.</p>

<p>Generation Z adolescents as a group of individuals who know <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> technology from an early age have a different <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> from the previous generations. The <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> experienced by generation Z adolescents is followed by behavior that is difficult to understand and sometimes misinterpreted as rebellion, for example disagreeing with their parents and doing things without the help of their parents anymore. Based on this phenomenon, this study aims to analyze the meaning of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for generation Z adolescents. This study uses a qualitative approach with phenomenological methods. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and then analyzed using the Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) technique on four adolescents (19-21 years). Based on the results of the analysis obtained the meaning of independence for generation Z adolescents, namely: (1) efforts to reduce intervention / assistance from parents; (2) differing views with parents; (3) accept the opportunity of parents to make decisions; and (4) the initiative to build work experience.</p>

<p>The globe has entered the era of hybrid wars and to be on the winning side, securing and protecting data remains a high priority for every nation. As hackers continue to explore and exploit, safeguarding systems and networks become even more difcult. Due to the pervasive deployment of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-physical systems and IOT devices, the need to defend the number and complexity of the systems increases rapidly.

<p>Efforts in quality improvement and development of education in the era of regional <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> are not only the responsibility of the central government and provincial governments, but also the responsibility of local governments. Quality improvement and development of education thus become strategic issues for any local government. This study aims to address issues related to: (1) the condition of school facilities and infrastructure (2) the role of school committees which is not optimal; (3) the absence of equitable distribution of teachers; and (4) the lack of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>y/ICT-based learning application in in secondary schools. The research was conducted in four districts, namely Bangkalan, Sampang, Pamekasan and Sumenep. The main theory employed in this study is the School Based Management (SBM) or the so-called School Based Management (SBM). The population was students, parents and teachers. The total number of samples was 250 people comprising 100 students, 100 parents and 50 teachers. The research data were obtained from primary and secondary data. The study yielded a number of key findings. First, 90% of High School (or its equivalent) teachers master the materials taught. This is due to fact that the materials taught are in accordance with the education qualification of the teacher. Secondly, the mismatch found in Madurese high schools was apparently caused by the lack of educators with suitable qualification for the subjects they teach concurrently. Almost all secondary teachers in Madura island require trainings related to the development of competency for mastering the subject materials. The last but not the least, the majority of teachers still apply simple learning methods. Although the method applied by teachers are generally similar, there are significant differences between the favorite schools and the other schools.</p>

<p>Trust should be learnt from history and context sensitive. It should not be absolute in nature. Due to the conglomeration of various technologies in a secure <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> physical system it is quite a challenge to handle trust issues in a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> physical system. Trust management in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> physical system is needed due to increase in the degree of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, decentralized policies ,dynamic environment, decision-making based on social rules,customs,laws,values, and ethics. This chapter brings light into the existing strategies already applied by few organizations, their inherent benefits and consequent shortcomings too. There are many factors contributing towards the establishment, expression, evaluation ,maintenance of trustworthiness. In this chapter we advocate a novel framework for trust management which stands up to the research directions of how to build a unified framework for trust management, how to modify the way we compute trust, how to decide the right granularity for a trust model</p>

 This issue of M/C Journal reclaims the language of “freedom”. 
 
 The selected articles demonstrate that today freedom is frequently overruled in the name of a permanent state of emergency. Present-day politics shows countless instances in which information, knowledge and culture are not seen as an inalienable right but are rather oppressed and distorted. Freedom is the freedom to say “no”, to withdraw your collaboration, to refuse friendly cooperation! To be “free” means to be able to enact your identity without having to capitulate to the ruling forces that dictate which discourses are and are not permissible in the public sphere(s).
 
 Citizens worldwide are armchair passengers on the nightly TV news train; they dream of their lives as being “free”. After all, to be free is a guaranteed human right, enshrined by the United Nations. Are freedom, independence and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> merely illusions, or are sociable media succeeding in empowering citizens for a participatory democracy as Yochai Benkler argues? If information “wants to be free”, the battle between intellectual “property” and creativity must be resolved. Technology does not make freedom inevitable: the on-the-ground-realities of network and hardware access make what seems to be “open” and “free”, closed and expensive for most people on this planet.
 
 The feature article for this issue of M/C Journal is a statement on the state of free speech in a free country: in “Depiction of Muslims in Selected Australian Media: Free Speech or Taking Sides”, Dr Nahid Kabir examines the publication of 12 cartoons depicting images of the Prophet Mohammad in 2005. In exploring the response of two Australian newspapers to the Danish controversy, the article considers whether the debate in the name of “free speech” has ended in a “form of attack” on Australian Muslims. 
 
 In “Freedom, Hate, Fronts”, Patrick Lynn Rivers reflects on the use of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> by the predominantly Afrikaner “Vryheidsfront Plus” political party to construct whiteness in post-apartheid South Africa. The creation of a politics centred on racial “cyborgs” points to the facilitation of freedom of an “oppressed minority”, continuing the Afrikaners’ historical struggle for self-determination and independence. Problematising this approach, Rivers concludes that, like freedom, whiteness after apartheid is far from defined.
 
 Authors Amita Nijhawan and Sukhmani Khorana both address Deepa Mehta’s highly-acclaimed film trilogy Fire, Earth, and Water. As a female Hindu director, Mehta engages controversial issues for Indian society: the life of widows who are forced into prostitution, for example. As observed, the trilogy has been subject to critiques of too much freedom from inside the country, counterbalanced by those outside the country condemning the Indian body-politic for its lack of freedom. In exploring post-colonial discourses in India’s construction of nation and gender, Nijhawan and Khorana present complementary accounts of the director’s struggle to resist government censorship. Hegemonic power is played out in the definition of freedom in relation to contested questions of self-representation in Indian society.
 
 Freedom of use and the notion of “property talk” are discussed by Australian lawyer and academic Steve Collins, commenting on the revival of values from Blackstonian copyright, in which ownership is seen to preclude the rights of others. Collins observes that talk of “property” risks making transformative works an elitist form of creativity, available only to those with the financial resources necessary to meet the demands for license fees. The notion of “property” thus challenges the freedom to create and to transform. Collins notes that this is no longer a philosophical question, but a practical one, as he entreats courts to move beyond the propertarian paradigm.
 
 A further angle on the issue of freedom is put forward by Nadine Henley in “Free to be Obese?” Here, Henley tackles the boundaries of state governance in controlling the bodies of its citizens: Is it ethical for a government to enforce the health of its citizens, or should obesity, for example, be a rightful choice?
 
 Two emotive Freedom Poems by Kathryn Waddell Takara conclude this issue. The editors have selected “Angela Davis” and “Mumia Abu Jamal: Knight for Justice” from the larger body of Takara’s work, Root Tapping, as representing the desire to celebrate freedom. The expectation of Angela Davis’ arrival and the transcendent revenge for the imprisonment of political activist Mumia Abu Jamal speak of the power of radical opposition in the face of oppression.

<p>The article provides a review of the regulatory documentation framework for the modernization of education in Russia, due to the joining the Bologna process. The directions refected at the level of the federal law on education, national doctrines and projects, federal target programs, letters of the Ministry of Education, and professional standards are considered. The change of the ‘knowledge’ paradigm to the ‘competence’ one is accompanied by the increasing use of digital technologies in all aspects of life, including education. Technological progress has led to computerization, and further informatization of education. The ubiquitous spread of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, directed by the Federal target program «Electronic Russia» (2002-2010) and the National project «Education», should have expanded the boundaries through the implementation of e-learning and distance learning technologies, promote democratization and accessibility of education, make the educational space more open. However, the monitoring has revealed problems with the overall strategy of e-education, the availability of the learning environment, and the availability of educational and methodological support. One of the possible ways to solve the problem is to appeal to open education and the implementation of massive open online courses, which are now designed by the leading Russian universities. A change of requirements for the participants of the educational process, an increase in students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, a tendency of forming an individual learning path, the use of project and group techniques based on digital technologies are seen. These measures should contribute to the competitiveness of the Russian higher education in the world.</p>

<p>The fundamental premises of Islamic law are that Allah has revealed His will for human-kind in the Holy Quran and the inspired example of the Prophet Muhammad (Peace be Upon Him), and that society’s law must conform to Allah’s revealed will. The scope of Islamic law is broader than the common law or civil law. In addition to core legal doctrines covering the family, wrongs, procedure, and commercial transactions, Islamic law also includes detailed rules regulating religious ritual and social etiquette. In Islam, religiosity is not asceticism in monasteries nor is it <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>tering from the pulpits. Instead, it is behaving in a manner that is requested from the Creator under all circumstances, places and times, in belief, statement and actions. Historically, law and religion have never been completely separated. They have never been so independent as to achieve complete <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> from each other. Religion has essentially been embodied in legal systems, even in those that have aspired to privatize religion. Based on this fact, this paper discusses such fact i.e religiosity on specific theme of Islamic law that is criminal law which means the body of law dealing with wrongs that are punishable in Islamic law with the object of deterrence.</p>

<p>In the third-year microprocessors course given to Me<span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>ronics Engineering students at the University of Waterloo, the lab studies have been redesigned as a scaffolded project. The project aims to provide a more authentic learning opportunity that integrates concepts from the concurrent courses, as well as prior courses. The project was carefully designed to provide some student <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> while ensuring competence can be achieved by students with a broad range of initial skill levels through the completion of authentic tasks. The impacts of the revised project on student learning were measured using pre- and postproject surveys, course grades and course critiques. Despite significant challenges that were encountered during the first two offerings, the results show that students perceived an increased competence in several key skills, and an increase was seen in overall course satisfaction.

<p>Digital India is an initiative of the Government of India, under which government departments have to connect with the people of the country. The purpose of this scheme is to ensure that the government services can be accessible electronically to the public without use of paper. The purpose of this scheme is to connect the rural areas through High Speed <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. A two-way platform will be built in this scheme where both (service providers and consumers) will be benefited. This will be an inter-ministerial initiative where all the ministries and departments will bring their services to the public such as health, education and judicial service, etc. The Public Private Partnership (PPP) model will be adopted as a choice. This scheme is one of the top priority projects of the Central Government. While there are many significant drawbacks like legal framework, lack of privacy, lack of data security rules, civilian <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> abuses, and lack of parliamentary surveillance for Indian e-surveillance and Indian <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> insecurity. All these shortcomings will be removed before implementing Digital India.</p>

<p>This article addresses the teaching carried out by teachers in the state of Paraíba during the Covid-19 pandemic and aims to reflect on the impacts of Emergency Remote Education (ERE) on their pedagogical practices. It is a case study whose data were collected through a questionnaire prepared in Google Forms, which was applied through a link to one hundred and five teachers of different subjects who work in municipal, state or federal public and private schools, in high school and / or in the final years of elementary school. The collected data were analyzed in the light of a literature that explores the ERE and its implementation. The results obtained showed a diversity of practices carried out by means of Digital <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies (DICT), part of which is in line with the modus operandi of traditional education and part of which seeks to overcome it. Taken together, these practices can provide students with more <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, new forms of communication between educational actors and the acquisition of new learning about the pedagogical use of DICT with the potential to modify the teaching that succeeds the pandemic, when we return to the “new normal” of classroom teaching</p>

<p>Use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> creates positive or negative impacts on adolescents. There are a number of factors enabling adolescents to make use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> positively. One of the factors studied in this research is the adolescent worldview. The adolescent worldview greatly determines the way she behaves and her attitude towards <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. The result of this research shows that adolescent worldview may release and enables her to reject negative impacts of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, particularly from modern culturalisms as relativism, individualism, emotionalism, presentism (present-time ism), materialism, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, victimism, and turn it into a positive impact on herself. Worldviews may be differentiated based on three categories namely religion, spirituality and secularity. This research is conducted by explorative-qualitative approach, using case study research method. Data collection process was conducted by in-depth interview with late adolescents.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic, which struck the world in 2020, has hit education systems around the world. The world community has begun searching for and testing models for organising the educational process in a new reality. The purpose of this study was to analyse how the education system in Ukraine is functioning under the COVID-19 pandemic. The theoretical framework for considering the research problem is based on the theory of synergetics. Such synergetic postulates as openness, evolution, dynamics, bifurcation point, interaction, self-organisation, irreversibility and new state are key guidelines for understanding the processes taking place in Ukrainian education. A qualitative research approach was used to guide the study. The research methods included the review of the governmental documents, review of the surveys and interviews. The major finding is that the COVID-19 pandemic is transforming the education system in Ukraine and many changes are positive. This includes the long-awaited <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of educational institutions, the opportunity to acquire digital skills by educators, strengthening cooperation with regional and local authorities and updates to the overloaded curriculum. The Ukrainian authorities, the pedagogical community and society are working together to organise education under new conditions. However, Ukrainian education faces serious challenges (partly inadequate <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> access in homes, especially in rural areas; lack of educators’ online instruction skills; few official methodological guidelines and online textbooks and low levels of motivation of students to participate in online sessions). The findings thus revealed the importance of a national strategy for the development of education, considering the recommendations of the international organisations and the experience of foreign countries.</p>

<p>One aspect that needs to be studied more deeply about the village administration in the era of village <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is the ability of the human resources in the management of village government in accordance village governance objectives and the demands of, “Undang – undang no 06 Tahun 2014 about the village. The capacity of the village government deemed not qualified to run the authority possessed by law the village. Weak capacity of rural government impact on law implementation failure that led to the poor rural village development. This study examines these issues. This study used qualitative research methods. The unit of analysis of this research that the village government Landungsari Dau District of Malang, East Java. This study was conducted over three years (2016, 2017, 2018). The findings of the research during the last four months in the first year of the study is Landungsari village administration showed a good performance in governance at the village of village <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> era (the era of the Village Law. The village government is able to carry out rural development planning, village administrative governance, and the financial management of the village properly. Nevertheless, the village government also faces serious problems is the lack of human resource capacity of the village administration, village very less quantity, and village officials do not understand the duties of each. To address these issues, the village government seeks to organize village governance based on information technology (e-government), but the effort has not worked well because the village government does not have a human resources professional in the field of information technology and the village government does not have enough budget to develop the e-government program. Therefore, the research team conducting FGD on the development of e-government program. FGD village government resulted in an agreement in cooperation with governmental science labs and e-government program APBDes budgeted in fiscal year 2017. Step next phase is the research team conducting FGD Phase II to design e-government as a means of governance villages effective and efficient, to disseminate the e-government, and publishes scientific articles on the model of governance based rural e-government in the Journal of Politics and Government Muhammadiyah University of Yogyakarta. Our advice as a researcher is a village government should make regulations governing <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>-based mechanism of public services (e-government). The regulation is to encourage villagers Landungsari to get used to using services based on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, the district government of Malang should provide support to the village government to make innovations in governance, and the central government should support the village government to strengthen rural government institutions such as the addition of the village</p>

<p>Overparenting is a parental style that seems to be popular in all over the world. Specific parental characteristics and multi-cultural differences seemed to play an important role in this parental style to appear. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to identify the factors shaping overparenting and the impact in children, adolescents and young adults in Greece, comparing to European and Worldwide context. A literature review was conducted using online databases and words such as «overparenting», «helicopter parents», «intrusive parenting», «parental interference», and «parental control». Overparenting seems to be related to negative effects in children’s psychosocial and mental health. It was associated with lack of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, low levels of self-regulation and mastery, which affected social adjustment skills and higher levels of anxiety, depressive symptoms, poor self-regulation and low levels of life satisfaction in children. In Greece, overparenting was related to poor school adjustment, obesity, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> addiction and post-traumatic stress from bullying. Overparenting is becoming more and more popular, so more research is becoming a necessity. It is important for every state to support and consult parents, from pregnancy to school, with specialized programs and teachers’ training with the collaboration of social scientists. Further research of the phenomenon, in Greece and cross-culturally, is however needed.</p>

<p>The accessibility of information via the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> has radically altered the doctor–patient relationship. By means of in-depth interviews with Israeli physicians from four different specialties, this study explored how physicians cope with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>-informed patients, referred to as e-patients, and examined how they make sense of their new professional roles. Findings show that three types of boundaries in the doctor–patient relationship have been blurred by the emergence of the e-patient: the boundaries between doctors’ and patients’ knowledge, between doctors’ authority and patients’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> , and between positivistic knowledge and humanistic knowledge. Each of these is a boundary between liberal and non-liberal values. Only the combination of all these components produces, according to the participants, a good doctor. I call this new phenomenon integrated medical expertise and explain how it diverges from previous notions of ‘good doctoring’. • When treating e-patients, boundaries between doctor and patient become blurred. • The blurred boundaries reflect transitions from liberal to non-liberal values. • This forms an integrated medical expertise – a new form of medical professionalism.</p>

<p>Purpose This research considers the role of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms and their impact on individuals’ eudaimonic well-being, and aims to help develop a social marketing programme in the future that would enable students in Jordanian universities to flourish, by focussing on their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> drivers and overcoming their challenges in an attempt to improve their psychological well-being (PWB). Design/methodology/approach The authors used qualitative research examining lived experiences and behaviours around <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use. The authors conducted 39 semi-structured interviews with students at various universities across Jordan, alongside an online survey with open-ended questions, which were based on six PWB dimensions: environmental mastery, personal growth, purpose in life, self-acceptance, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and positive relationships with others. Findings <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social media</span> use and advertising were found to positively impact students’ self-acceptance and relationships with others but to negatively impact their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. They were found to have different impacts on students’ sense of purpose in life and personal growth, depending on the content shared on their platforms. Originality/value The ethical debate surrounding <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> amongst students indicates that such social marketing programmes might stimulate individuals’ sense of control over their environment, encourage openness to new experiences, and give their lives a beneficial direction. The study makes recommendations for the creation of an evidence-based social marketing programme that is extrinsically focussed on increasing resilience, creating an audience persona and building awareness of PWB.</p>

<p>In industrial business-to-business (B2B) markets, physical entities (such as products, machines, materials, or other objects) are increasingly connected among each other. This Industrial <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things (IIoT) is quickly developing thanks to advances in fields such as information systems, factory digitalization, data sciences, robotics. Thus, industrial markets appear both as business networks - encompassing connections between individual or organizational actors – and networks of connected things. The purpose of this research is to provide an integrative perspective that encompasses both types of networks. It seeks to contribute to the literature on industrial B2B markets in two ways. First, it proposes the system of systems (SoS) theory - which emphasizes diversity and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of systems - as an integrative perspective. Second, it argues that this integrated perspective contributes to a new view on how resources are produced, combined, and used, and, therefore, on business network models. We discuss the implications for one of the most established models, the IMP Group’s A-R-A model. • Traditional representations of business networks may not be adapted in IIoT (Industrial <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things) contexts. • In IIoT actors are not only humans or organizations. • In IIoT technologies are not necessarily resources. • A system of systems approach of business networks is introduced. • Impacts on new connections between actors, and value creation are discussed.</p>

<p>Social network has become an important channel for people to obtain information.Trusted user information behavior is the key to build <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>space security. A dynamic reputation evaluation method based on supervision feedback of user information behavior is helpful to promote social network self-discipline and achieve good community <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The comprehensive reputation evaluation of each node integrates identity and behavior reputation. And the reputation is dynamically updated by setting the new node evaluation period and phased update mechanism. Identity reputation is calculated by information disclosure and network characteristics; Behavior reputation is calculated by information release and forwarding, and rewards or punishments will be given to self-correction of information behavior or blocking of bad information. The simulation results show that compared with the traditional trust evaluation mechanism, setting rewards and punishments guidance can improve the accuracy of reputation evaluation. At the same time, reputation incentive can also inhibit the interaction of bad information while promoting the consciousness of reporting.</p>

<p>This study aims to investigate how Turkish students’ involvement in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICT) predicts their math and science performance in the 2018 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) test. The research also tests demographic variables including socioeconomic status (SES) and gender as covariates. The data were examined through two-step hierarchical regression analyses. Regarding demographics, SES revealed a significant positive contribution to the prediction of math and science performance, whereas gender failed to make a significant contribution. Additionally, after controlling demographics, ICT availability at home significantly and negatively predicted student math and science performance, whilst ICT availability at school was not found to be significantly contributory. Regarding ICT use variables, all constructs significantly predicted student math and science performances, but some negatively contributed to the model, whereas others positively contributed. Amongst ICT attitude variables, all constructs made a significantly positive or negative contribution to predicting both math and science performance, with one exception. Only perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in ICT use failed to significantly contribute to the prediction of math performance. Based on the findings, it was concluded that persistent involvement in ICT tends to be related to decreased math and science performance. We propose that policymakers and practitioners drop the myth that ICT use results in better achievement under any circumstances and should therefore refrain from integrating ICT without first undertaking careful planning.</p>

<p>The twentieth century was marked by a large number of various kinds of changes that affected almost all spheres of society. New phenomena began to appear in sociological science, the explanation of which caused difficulties and required sociological theory to rethink the methods and analytical models used by it. Among the factors that have had an active influence on the evolution of the network concept, first of all, we should include the development of transport infrastructure, telephone networks and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. The concept of a network has been increasingly used to explain social phenomena. This approach in modern sociology is called “network”, which, according to many researchers, is quite productive, as it has a high potential in solving existing problems and in forming a response to the emerging tasks of modern sociological science. It should be noted that in the domestic sociological tradition and in applied research, the possibilities of using the “network approach” remain poorly understood. Many Russian sociologists do not include this approach in the focus of their attention. This article presents a comparative theoretical analysis of the existing areas of the network approach. The main aspects of comparison are: the time and context of appearance, the main provisions, the methodology and methods of empirical research. Common features and differences between the analyzed areas are highlighted. At the end of the article, a conclusion is formulated about the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of each of the designated areas. Based on this fact, it is assumed that the term “network approach” is used solely as a collective name for different theories and approaches that operate with the concept of a network in different senses.</p>

<p>There is a shortage of registered nurses (RNs) who work in the specialty of Psychiatric-Mental Health (PMH). Attrition among Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurses (PMHNs) may be related to a lack of leadership empowerment which includes <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and access to professional development opportunities. The purposes of this study, guided by Kanter’s theory of structural empowerment, were to determine (a) if there was a relationship between leadership empowerment behavior and PMH RNs’ intent to leave within the first 2 years of practice in inpatient psychiatric settings and (b) if there was a relationship between leadership empowerment behavior and intent to leave among this population who are in their first 2 years of practice, based on RN demographics. The key variables were measured with the Leader Empowering Behavior Questionnaire and the Turnover Intention Scale. The study participants included 111 psychiatric RNs in their first 2 years of practice who were recruited via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. Results showed an inverse relationship between leadership empowerment behavior and intent to leave. The RN demographic characteristics did not affect this relationship. The study findings could be used for social change by creating awareness for PMHN leaders to develop empowerment behavior as a strategy to mitigate new PMH RN turnover so that they can stay in practice and positively impact therapeutic and quality patient care delivery. Future studies using mixed methods and a larger sample size would be helpful to obtain an in-depth understanding of the role of leadership empowerment behavior and retention from the RN’s perspective.</p>

<p>This paper examines the innovation strategy of Siemens, a key player in Europe’s digital economy, by performing network and lexical analyses using data derived from Siemens’s patents and scientific publications since 1998. We observe that the company’s innovation efforts evolved from a broader attempt to develop internal <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) capabilities – alongside its historical industrial priorities – to a strategy focused on developing artificial intelligence (AI) for sector-specific and niche applications (such as life and medical sciences). As a result, it became dependent on tech giants’ clouds for accessing more general AI services and digital infrastructure. We build on the intellectual monopoly literature focusing on the effects of tech giants on other leading corporations, to analyse Siemens’s experience. By abandoning the development of general ICT and given the emergence of tech giants as digital economy intellectual monopolies, we show that Siemens is risking its technological <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> towards these big tech companies. Our results provide clues to understand the challenges faced by Europe and its firms in relation to US and Chinese tech giants.</p>

<p>&lt;p style=“text-align: justify;”&gt;A professional development that is often mandated is exclusionary, less motivating, and provides teachers with little or no improvement in their professional practice as well as student achievement. This necessitates a fundamental change in policy from prescribing professional development to addressing teachers’ self-identified felt needs. Hitherto, teachers are generally disenfranchised from specifying their felt needs for development, thus they feel uninterested, or enthusiastic to attend professional development programs that are prescribed for them by school leaders. When they do or are compelled to attend, they tend to be less attentive and are often indulged in reading newspapers, grading students’ test papers, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">texting</span>, playing video games, or simply doing something unrelated to the professional development. This practice stifles teachers’ professional growth and student learning, hence it must not be allowed to continue unabated. Through a qualitative case study research design, using survey, interviews, and focus groups, this research brought to the fore, the debilitating effects of the current practice. Analysis of data yielded four major themes: choice, motivation, effectiveness, and satisfaction. The study proposed a paradigm shift in policy from mandating to granting teachers the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to identify their own real or felt needs for professional development. Implications for practice, leadership, policy, and further research were also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>The work was carried out in line with the current idea of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> as a global media that interacts with various sign systems and influences the structural and compositional features of the verbal text. The relevance of the study is due to the formation of the concept of intermediality in the context of a new cultural direction, called “metavirtualism”. The aim of the article is to characterize the principles underlying the structure and composition of the network poetic “book”. Russian-language poetic cycles are considered, the structural and compositional features and expressive means of which are associated with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> technologies. Such aspects as the type of intermediality and ways of organizing the structure and composition of the network “book” are analyzed; the reader’s way of getting acquainted with the work and the degree of freedom of this way; manifestation of the category of ephemerality. It is concluded that technological poetry, paradoxically, strengthens traditional book forms, but also has an independent value, visualizing poetic images and metaphors. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> technologies can be “embedded” into the structure and composition of a poetry book at various levels: it can be relative <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>; interaction at the level of a conceptual metaphor explicated with the help of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> media (Google maps); almost complete fusion of media.</p>

<p>The article deals with ethical aspects of physician-patient relationship in dermatology, and demonstrates their influence on success of diagnostic and treatment activities and level of satisfaction with quality of medical services. Special attention is paid to the specific nature of bioethical issues in dermatology, associated with visuality and peculiarities of the course of disease, emotional and physiological background and coexisting disorders. Special priority is given to effective strategies of physician-patient communication, respect for patient <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and protection of confidentiality both in clinical practice, and on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. It is shown that linking personal and strategic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> accounts raises a number of ethical and legal issues, associated with obtaining voluntary informed consent, compliance with standards of corporate ethics, and perception of medical information by non-professional audience. In conclusion, compliance with principles and rules of biomedical ethics is important to set constructive relations in clinical dermatological practice, ensure social trust in medicine and prepare future specialists. It is also important to discuss ethical issues in a professional community, slowly forming an interdisciplinary space of communication between physicians, health officials, specialists in bioethics, medical law, psychology and sociology of medicine.</p>

<p>Composite tissue transplantation has gained a new dimension in line with advanced technological developments. In extremity losses, the traditionally implemented procedure is to enable the extremity to regain its functionality through replantation instead of transplantation. On the other hand, innovative studies are also carried out to support and strengthen the human body and improve the problematic body functions for increasing patients’ quality of life. Studies on developing biome<span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>ronic systems, which are related to biology, neurology, biophysics, mechanics, biomedical and tissue engineering, electronics, and computer sciences, are in progress, which indicates that a transformation has occurred in the approaches to composite tissue transplantation. This study aims to generate ideas about determining a conventional limit in the interventions towards the human body against the technological and scientific developments and to perform a value analysis on such interventions. This study was designed within the framework of the methodology of medical ethics and in the light of the slippery slope argument. The process of transformation from the medical procedures that aim to protect patients’ bodily integrity to the innovative practices that provide an opportunity to bionically turn healthy human bodies into the half machine and half-human is investigated in the light of the slippery slope argument. This study indicated that the value-related problems regarding this issue are related to the principles of respect for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. The limit to be determined for the practices that aim to protect the patients’ bodily integrity and increase their quality of life and that are not life-saving depends on the distinction between an ill body and a healthy body. A meticulous clinical perspective and legislative regulations that prevent the instrumentalization of humans are required so as not to roll down to undesirable places on a slope. Advanced technological developments are implemented in medicine, protecting human dignity should be adopted as a fundamental value.</p>

<p>Purpose Though employees are important stakeholders of a brand, their role in building brand equity has long been neglected. This study aims to deepen the understanding of employees’ brand co-creation efforts and their contribution to employee-based brand equity (EBBE). Design/methodology/approach The study analyses implicit and explicit communication activities by employees on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> network LinkedIn and quantifies the contribution of their posts to EBBE. Data has been gathered from more than 1,300 posts and 130 private accounts, representing different employee groups of five corporate brands. Findings The investigation illustrates the high importance of brand co-creation in social networks by employees and helps practitioners to better understand the underlying processes. Research limitations/implications Case-study research has limitations of generalisability. However, the authors unveil important limits to exploiting the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of employees’ word-of-mouth communication. Practical implications Under a co-creative perspective, every <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> activity of an employee can be a positive contribution to a brand’s equity. Therefore, companies should closely monitor EBBE. Originality/value The authors draw on basic conceptual insights and empirical work by other researchers but extend and interpret them in a new context. The study provides initial indications of key antecedents of and barriers to successful management of employees’ brand co-creation activities.</p>

<p>The relevance of the study is determined by the need to develop programs for psychological correction and prevention of violations of parent-child relationships in families raising adolescents with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction. In the conditions of modern society, there is a steady trend towards an increase in the number of children and adolescents with a tendency to addictive behavior. Parent-child relations, the image of a parent in adolescents with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction has certain specific features. Materials and methods. The research uses the following methods: “<span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction scale” (Chen) (Chen <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction Scale – CIAS), adapted by V.L. Malygina, K.A. Feklisova; questionnaire “Adolescents about parents” (ADOR) E. Schafer, modified by Z. Mateychek, P. Richan, adapted by L.I. Wasserman, I.A. Gorkova and E.E. Romitsyna. The research was carried out in educational institutions of the Sverdlovsk region. The sample size is 167 adolescents (average age – 15.7 years, with S = 0.36). Research results. The results of the study confirm the existence of significantly significant differences in parent’s image among adolescents with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction and adolescents without a tendency to addictive behavior. The revealed differences are associated with the perception of the image of parents both from the content side, which includes the degree of approval, understanding, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and from the structural side, reflecting educational strategies, methods of upbringing and the attitude of parents. Thus, adolescents with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction believe that their mothers show less “positive interest” in the events of their lives than adolescents without <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction (t = -9.06; at p &lt;0.001); less often reproduce <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (t = -3.41; at p &lt;0.001); more often inclined to directivity (t = 7.92; at p &lt;0.001) and hostility (t = 8.68; at p &lt;0.001), inconsistent in their educational influences (t = 4.12; at p &lt;0.001). Adolescents with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction pay more attention to hostile and distant parental attitudes (t = 7.64; at p &lt;0.001), focusing on the negative behavior of the adolescent (t = -6.82; at p &lt;0.001); the educational strategy is perceived by adolescents as predominantly inconsistent (t = 2.23; at p &lt;0.001) and directive (t = 4.50; at p &lt;0.001). These differences, according to the authors, are associated with both the characteristics of the parent, as well as with the psychological properties of the personality, prone to addictive behavior. The scientific novelty of the research lies in the fact that in Russian psychology, for the first time, a study has been undertaken of the characteristics of the parent’s image in adolescents who differ in the degree of their propensity to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction.</p>

<p>Women’s economic and social empowerment is facilitated by their ability to move around independently and safely. However, in many developing countries women’s physical mobility is restricted by social norms, structural impediments related to poor quality of roads and transport systems, and security issues. Restrictions on female physical mobility and low levels of empowerment can also have negative implications for women’s access to healthcare services. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Mobile phone</span>s could help connect women to information and social networks and thus also strengthen their bargaining power within the household. Here, we use nationally representative data from 39,523 women in India collected in 2011-12 to analyse associations between women’s use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s and selected indicators of female <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and empowerment. Results indicate that women’s <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> use is positively associated with their physical mobility range and use of non-surgical contraceptives, whereas it is negatively associated with surgical contraceptive methods. We also analyse to what extent these associations are influenced by other socioeconomic and cultural factors. Our findings suggest that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s can play an important positive role for women’s empowerment in India.</p>

<p>Quality of life (QOL) is lower for transition-age autistic youth compared to typically developing counterparts. Leisure-time pursuits have been linked to higher quality of life in the general population and among autistic adults. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore leisure-time use among transition-age autistic youth. Youth ages 18–23 years were recruited through universities and organizations that serve the autistic population and their families across the United States. Participants took photos of their leisure-time activities over a 7-day period using their own <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s. They were then interviewed via Zoom using a semi-structured interview guide that was based on the Self-Determination Theory framework and the Iwasaki leisure-time model. Data were analyzed using directed qualitative content analysis based on the theoretical framework. Eighteen young autistic adults participated in the study (nine male, five female, three agender/non-binary, and one transgender). Solitary, screen-based activities were most common. Major themes were that activities contributed positively to a sense of achievement and a sense of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and there were few major barriers to favored activities. While most activities were done alone, rather than describing these activities as isolating, activities helped participants cope with stress. Participants gained a sense of connection when they were engaged in leisure activities with others who shared common interests. Results suggest that appropriate interventions may support youth in choosing activities they most enjoy, even if they appear to be solitary or sedentary, and to help ensure that youth are gaining maximal benefits from these activities. • Few studies have examined leisure-time use among transition-age autistic youth. • Youth effectively shared experiences using participant-driven photo-elicitation. • Results suggest leisure activities contribute to well-being.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic led, in Portugal as well in other countries, to an abrupt transition to online classes in higher education, with no consideration for the specific students’ conditions. Therefore, this study aims to assess the students’ perspective on online learning classes carried out during the lockdown in 2020. The analysis is based on 2,107 valid answers from students of seven Portuguese higher education institutions that took synchronous online classes. Principal component analysis and binary logistic regression were the main quantitative methods used. This study identified five factors that, in all cases, significantly explain the students’ perspective on the transition to online classes. These factors include not only pedagogical matters (teachers’ overall quality) but also elements related to personal or motivational students’ characteristics (performance and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>; constraints and obstacles to socialization; self-confidence while attending online classes) and technological issues (<span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> access conditions). Notwithstanding, self-confidence is not a relevant factor for students that had technical limitations in what concerns infrastructural matters. Therefore, besides confirming the factors behind the success of online classes, this research is relevant for highlighting the need to assure that students have the proper conditions regarding technical infrastructures to improve the overall quality of online classes.

<p>With the introduction of personal computer systems and subsequent technologies that make flow of information fast and efficient, a new age emerged that is often termed as ‘digital age’ or ‘digital era’. During this age, the capabilities of individuals and societies to access and use multiple forms of convergent media content got enhanced manifold. It also led to a revolution in the industry of ‘news and views’. This convergent media is popularly known as the ‘New Media’. While this new (digital) media is taking new shapes across the globe, it is still struggling for survival in one part of the world called Kashmir. Due to frequent suspensions of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> service in the valley, the digital media of Kashmir faces multiple challenges that are mostly unknown to other parts of the world. During 2010, 2012 and 2016 uprisings in Kashmir and more recently in 2019–2020, when Indian government decided to scrap the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and special status of the valley, this place was excluded digitally that had a huge setback not only to the growth of New Media, but on education, health and economy as well. This paper studies this digital exclusion and its impact on journalism and mass communication in Kashmir.</p>

<p>The proliferation of Smart <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span>-Physical Systems (SCPS) is increasingly blurring the boundaries between physical and virtual entities. This trend is revolutionizing multiple application domains along the whole human activity spectrum, while pushing the growth of new businesses and innovations such as smart manufacturing, cities and transportation systems, as well as personalized healthcare. Technological advances in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things, Big Data, Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence have effected tremendous progress toward the autonomic control of SCPS operations. However, the inherently dynamic nature of physical environments challenges SCPS’ ability to perform adequate control actions over managed physical assets in myriad of contexts. From a design perspective, this issue is related to the system states of operation that cannot be predicted entirely at design time, and the consequential need to define adequate capabilities for run-time self-adaptation and self-evolution. Nevertheless, adaptation and evolution actions must be assessed before realizing them in the managed system in order to ensure resiliency while minimizing the risks. Therefore, the design of SCPS must address not only dependable <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> but also operational resiliency. In light of this, the contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we propose a reference architecture for designing dependable and resilient SCPS that integrates concepts from the research areas of Digital Twin, Adaptive Control and Autonomic Computing. Second, we propose a model identification mechanism for guiding self-evolution, based on continuous experimentation, evolutionary optimization and dynamic simulation, as the architecture’s first major component for dependable <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Third, we propose an adjustment mechanism for self-adaptation, based on gradient descent, as the architecture’s second major component, addressing operational resiliency. Our contributions aim to further advance the research of reliable self-adaptation and self-evolution mechanisms and their inclusion in the design of SCPS. Finally, we evaluate our contributions by implementing prototypes and showing their viability using real data from a case study in the domain of intelligent transportation systems.</p>

<p>Recently, scholars across disciplines raised ethical, legal and social concerns about the notion of human intervention, control, and oversight over Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. This observation becomes particularly important in the age of ubiquitous computing and the increasing adoption of AI in everyday communication infrastructures. We apply Nicholas Garnham’s conceptual perspective on mediation to users who are challenged both individually and societally when interacting with AI-enabled systems. One way to increase user agency are mechanisms to contest faulty or flawed AI systems and their decisions, as well as to request redress. Currently, however, users structurally lack such mechanisms, which increases risks for vulnerable communities, for instance patients interacting with AI healthcare <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots. To empower users in AI-mediated communication processes, this article introduces the concept of active human agency. We link our concept to contestability and redress mechanism examples and explain why these are necessary to strengthen active human agency. We argue that AI policy should introduce rights for users to swiftly contest or rectify an AI-enabled decision. This right would empower individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and strengthen fundamental rights in the digital age. We conclude by identifying routes for future theoretical and empirical research on active human agency in times of ubiquitous AI.</p>

<p>• COVID-19 has disrupted global production and supply chains. • Some minerals deemed “strategic” are subject to supply-related risks. • Categories of “strategic” minerals are crucial to different countries. • Several countries are outlining post-COVID-19 strategies to ensure sufficient supplies of critical minerals. In 2020, many countries endorsed lockdown measures, closed their borders, and practiced social distancing in a bid to contain COVID-19. These moves, however, disrupted global production and supply chains; no economic sector remained fully intact. The pandemic has exposed the vulnerability of supply chains in a globalized world, perhaps none more so than those linked to the distribution of essential raw materials. Minerals are considered raw materials, the extraction of which has important implications for a country’s sovereignty and economic <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. They are found in abundance in consumer goods such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s, cell phone batteries, computer monitors, cards, and other electrical and electronic products whose useful life has ended. In response to the health and economic problems arising from the current crisis, several countries have moved ahead and outlined post-COVID-19 strategies for the supply of critical metals, over the medium and long term, to reduce their dependence on other states for these commodities. This paper reflects critically on the positioning of the world’s large economies, in the face of the COVID-19 crisis, on strategic minerals.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic led to an abrupt change from in-person to online teaching in higher education, resulting in increased use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) and students’ stress and uncertainty. Integrating theories of human motivation, stress, and humane work design, we investigated whether different types of action regulation hindrances (ARH) pertaining to human (ICT competence deficits), technology (technical problems), interaction (coordination difficulties), and task aspects (work overload) related to technostress (H1). Furthermore, we examined if this relationship was mediated by satisfaction of the basic human needs for competence, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and relatedness (H2). Our analysis of causes and mechanisms of technostress is based on cross-sectional survey data (self-report) from 205 psychology students attending an organizational psychology class that was switched from an in-person to an online format due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Structural equation modeling revealed that different types of ARH (i.e., ICT competence deficits, technical problems, coordination difficulties, work overload) positively predicted technostress (β = .17 to β = .42, p &lt; .05). The effects were (partially) mediated by satisfaction of the need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (β = .11 to β = .15, p &lt; .05), for all ARH except technical problems (β = .01, p = .86). We discuss implications for online course planning, technostress prevention as well as potential interventions beyond pandemic times.</p>

<p>Augmented reality (AR) has found application in online games, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, interior design, and other services since the success of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> game Pokémon Go in 2016. With recent news on the metaverse and the AR cloud, the contexts in which the technology is used become more and more ubiquitous. This is problematic, since AR requires various different sensors gathering real-time, context-specific personal information about the users, causing more severe and new privacy threats compared to other technologies. These threats can have adverse consequences on information self-determination and the freedom of choice and, thus, need to be investigated as long as AR is still shapeable. This communication paper takes on a bird’s eye perspective and considers the ethical concept of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> as the core principle to derive recommendations and measures to ensure <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. These principles are supposed to guide future work on AR suggested in this article, which is strongly needed in order to end up with privacy-friendly AR technologies in the future.</p>

<p>Adolescents are spending significant time online. Consequently, concerns are consistently raised about potential negative impacts on their mental health. Potentially, these concerns minimise their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and reify the construction of the vulnerable adolescent. Using template analysis, we explored adolescents’ perspectives ( N = 54) of the relationship between <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and mental health. We centrally considered the wide array of uses made of different <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> by the participants, focusing on their understandings of the potentially positive effects these might have. Focus group discussions showed <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> could be used to reduce stress, have value for social connectivity, were an important source of information about mental health, and provided a platform for peer-to-peer support. Our conclusion indicated adolescents are generally socially competent online and are often experimenting with their emergent sense of agency.</p>

<p>ABSTRACT Background The challenge of graduate medical education is to prepare physicians for unsupervised practice while ensuring patient safety. Current approaches may inadequately prepare physicians due to limited opportunities for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Recent work on how trainees gain <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> shows that they actively influence their supervisors’ entrustment decisions. If program directors more clearly understand how trainees experience increasing independence, they may better sensitize trainees to the deliberations they will face during patient care. Objective The authors sought to explore how trainees experience lessening supervision as their clinical training advances. Methods Using constructivist grounded theory, the authors recruited trainees from various specialties and training levels via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> and conducted 17 semi-structured interviews from 2019 to 2020 to solicit clinical experiences during which their perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> changed. Through constant comparison and iterative analysis, key themes and conceptual relationships were identified. Results Seventeen trainees from 4 specialties described novel clinical situations that required “overextending,” or going beyond their perceived edge of evolving expertise. This move represented a spectrum based on perceived locus of control, from deliberate overextending driven by trainees, to forced overextending driven by external factors. Trainee judgments about whether or not to overextend were distilled into key questions: (1) Can I do it? (2) Must I do it? (3) Do I want to do it? and (4) Is it safe to do it? More advanced trainees posed a fifth question: (5) Am I missing something? Conclusions Decisions to move into the realm of uncertainty about capabilities carried weight for trainees. In making deliberative judgments about overextending, they attempted to balance training needs, capability, urgency, and patient safety.</p>

<p>The aim of this study is to describe the experience of Higher Education Institution (HEI) faculty members on transactional distance in the context of a flexible educational landscape during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data gathered from eight (8) participants who have been teaching in a state college since the start of the pandemic. A common meaning of distance emerged from the analysis and was revealed through three different aspects wherein the variables of the Transactional Distance Theory (TDT) are concerned predominantly: i. dialogue (difficulty in communication and interaction), ii. structure (issues on participation due to intermittent <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> connectivity), and iii. learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (poor performance in assessment results). These variables in TDT prompted the exemplification of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>gogy and heutagogy in a flexible educational landscape from the descriptions of teachers. Responding to the sense of distance, teaching reflected upon the opportunity in sharing current practice to foster flexibility while employing a learning management system to accommodate learner needs. The findings were discussed and interpreted as an embodied experience originating from the passage of transactional distance continually affecting faculty members’ life fundamental transition to a changed pedagogical space that is reflected in their experience of teaching amidst the constraints brought by the pandemic.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> has penetrated into people’s lives as the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> education platform has faced many changes in the way vocal music is taught in the new situation. The teaching methods set up on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> have also undergone dramatic changes. A number of advanced music education concepts have emerged that require a careful review of the current state of music education in the world and in China. Current online learning environments are usually used only for formal or informal learning. The former overemphasizes the subjective role of the teacher and ignores the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the learner. Through a new modern network education method, this paper deeply analyzes the unique advantages and existing problems of a new voice education method based on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and puts forward corresponding solutions. Its purpose is to encourage more ordinary vocal music teachers to better understand the new teaching methods, broaden their artistic horizons, consciously use modern teaching methods to support vocal music education in ordinary schools, and further expand the scope of music application. The experimental results show that for 4000 concurrent users, the response time of the system is less than 5 seconds, which can meet the time requirements of the system. For the service of querying some other data, the response time of the system is less than 9 seconds, so the response ability of the system to multiple users is impressive. Therefore, with the development of education, comprehensive network education platform is also the development direction of informatization in the future.</p>

<p>In todays advanced society, there is rising concern for data privacy and the diminution thereof on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>. I argue from the position that for one to enjoy privacy, one must be able to effectively exercise autonomous action. I offer in this paper a survey of the many ways in which persons <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is severely limited due to a variety of privacy invasions that come not only through the use of modern technological apparatuses, but as well simply by existing in an advanced technological society. I conclude that regarding the majority of persons whose privacy is violated, such a violations are actually initiated and upheld by the users of modern technology themselves, and that ultimately, most disruptions of privacy that occur are self-levied.</p>

<p>This article examines the rural portrait in the Acehnese society amidst the racist raciality of technology, where the increasing number of digitalisations in the village, the values of rural areas seem to be experiencing a decline or change unlike before. A <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> or a mobile device that has been created as complex as possible to be multi-functional, can function as a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>, as access to news, online games and so on. So that young people in the village, even even ua people are neglected because of it, so as to result in a rural identity gradually experiencing degradation or decline. The research method used is by means of observation, directly observing phenomena in the field and also combining them with data collected from various literature related to rural sociology. The results of these findings show, in fact there is something that needs to be taken care of behind the entry of digitalization of rural communities in Aceh, even though the rationality of this technology cannot be bent, it can be conditioned by maintaining tradition, village <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and village values amidst the impact of digitalization.</p>

<p>The Autistic community values neurodiversity-positive approaches rather than behavioral interventions for Autistic children; however, little is known about what that would look like in occupational therapy. Frequently, researchers seek parent perspectives for understanding Autistic children’s preferences, while to date insufficient attention has been paid to Autistic adults as valuable informants on the Autistic experience of Autistic children. The objective of the study was to understand Autistic adult perspectives on pediatric occupational therapy for Autistic children. We sought and thematically analyzed data from a large <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> group and an occupational therapy podcast on Autistic values, needs, and experiences in pediatric occupational therapy. Participants described wanting therapy that supported Autistic identities rather than trying to “fix” children, changing environments or tasks to promote participation, and setting goals that address self-advocacy and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Occupational therapy practitioners should critically reflect on their practice’s alignment with Autistic values and start to shift their practice as needed.</p>

<p>This study aims to reveal the economic and political issues underlying the remarks related to initial teacher education (ITE) in the documents published by international institutions, European Union (EU), Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and United Nations (UN), and to examine these issues from the perspective of consensus and conflict approaches to education. The study is designed as a systematic review. ITE-related 67 documents published by UN, EU, and OECD were analyzed following several coding steps. According to the results, international institutions promote entrepreneurship, life-long learning, and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies as economic issues in ITE. As political issues, they put forward social themes including preparing for diversity, quality in ITE including accountability and standards, and structure of ITE including flexibility and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Although the documents are mainly parallel with the consensus approach, economic and political issues revealed in the study were discussed from perspectives of both approaches. One perspective considers promoting the economic issues in ITE the economic efficiency and growth which is beneficial for all. The other reminds that division of this benefit may include class-based inequalities. Also, different perspectives emphasize different social themes and they bring different explanations for how the quality assurance functions.</p>

<p>Memories of rejection contribute to feeling lonely. However, high-quality listening that conveys well-meaning attention and understanding when speakers discuss social rejection may help them to reconnect. Speakers may experience less loneliness because they feel close and connected (relatedness) to the listener and because listening supports self-congruent expression (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>). Five experiments (total N = 1,643) manipulated listening during visualized (Studies 1, 4, 5) and actual (Studies 2, 3) conversations. We used different methods (video vignettes; in-person; <span style="background-color:lightgreen">computer-mediated</span>; recall; written scenarios) to compare high-quality with regular (all studies) and poor (Study 1) listening. Findings across studies showed that high-quality listening reduced speakers’ state loneliness after they shared past experiences of social rejection. Parallel mediation analyses indicated that both feeling related to the listener and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> satisfaction (particularly its self-congruence component; Study 5) mediated the effect of listening on loneliness. These results provide novel insights into the hitherto unexplored effect of listening on state loneliness.</p>

<p>Purpose Personally owned mobile <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (MICT) have been widely and routinely used for work purposes in the post-pandemic workplace. Drawing on adaptive structuration theory for individuals (ASTI), this study investigates the antecedents (i.e.&nbsp;characteristics of MICT) and outcomes (i.e.&nbsp;employee affective and cognitive well-being) of routine MICT use in the remote work context. Design/methodology/approach The research model was empirically tested via a survey of 430 working professionals who use personal MICT for work purposes in the remote work context. Findings Results show that the routine MICT use increases employee affective well-being (i.e.&nbsp;job satisfaction) and mitigates cognitive well-being (i.e.&nbsp;technology overload). The mediation effects of routine MICT use on the relationships between its characteristics (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and timeliness) and employee well-being (i.e.&nbsp;job satisfaction and technology overload) were also found. Originality/value Existing research on remote work has widely focused on employee productivity and performance, while attention has rarely been paid to the effects of the technology-driven “new normal” on employee well-being. Grounded in ASTI, this study identifies three MICT characteristics as sources of user adaptive structuration, which impact employees’ routine MICT use behavior and further influence employee affective and cognitive well-being. This research can help understand employees’ personal MICT use adaptive behavior and improve their well-being.</p>

The purpose of the article is to determine the pedagogical conditions for the organization of the educational process in higher educational institution with specific studying conditions in terms of martial law throughout Ukraine. Methodology of the article. Consideration of the peculiarities of the organization of the educational process in higher educational institutions with specific studying conditions. It is revealed that in terms of martial law, there is a need to introduce pedagogical conditions to address issues related to: limiting opportunities for the use of information and communicative technologies in the educational process while the absence of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and mobile communications; ensuring timely completion of course and qualification papers by all applicants for higher education; conducting group classes that provide for the circulation of language information with limited access; involving scientific and pedagogical workers and cadets in scientific work. It is highlighted that the normative legal acts regulating the educational process provide general recommendations for ensuring two-way communication between the subjects of the educational process in a higher educational institution. The effectiveness of the introduction of pedagogical conditions related to the organization of the educational process in terms of martial law has been demonstrated, on the example of the Academy of the State Penitentiary Service. The educational process is represented through a system of scientific and methodological and pedagogical measures that have proven their worth in terms of martial law. Results. The analysis of normative legal acts regulating the activity of higher educational institutions contributed to the highlighting of the peculiarities of the organization of the educational process in the terms of martial law. It is proved that in terms of martial law the organization of the educational process is significantly influenced by factors caused by difficulties in using informative and communicative technologies for group classes, setting educational tasks that require additional sources in a special library, ensuring academic integrity, effective development of general and special (professional) competencies. Practical significance of the obtained results is that they contribute to choosing the pedagogical conditions that promote the organization of the educational process in higher educational institutions with specific studying conditions in terms martial law. Key words: <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of higher educational institution, pedagogical conditions, individual schedule, informative and communicative technologies, academic disciplines.</p>

<p>The employment psychology of young migrant workers in China has changed drastically in past decades. In particular, the construction industry has been facing labor shortages and aging workforces for years, and the eruption of coronavirus disease 2019 has exacerbated the problem. In contrast, the food delivery business has grown rapidly during the pandemic with a surge in the number of food delivery knights. It is vitally important to understand the employment psychology of the young migrant workers, the main component of the workforce for both industries. The presented study conducted a comparative analysis between construction workers and food delivery knights using data from face-to-face interviews, online <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, and World Value Survey. Results showed that the two groups of young migrant workers have different employment psychology during their job selection, construction workers cared more about income, and food delivery knights paid more attention to <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, working environment, and family.</p>

<p>Self-regulated learning is a method of the student-centered learning paradigm. This method encourages students to be actively involved in the learning process, organize themselves, recognize their capabilities, and take the initiative to decide the appropriate way to achieve the learning achievement. The use of self-regulated learning with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s’ assistance has had a double effect on students’ language proficiency. However, the self-regulated learning method with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> assistance in the speaking class has not been supported by current empirical studies. The evidence indicates that self-regulated learning with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s’ assistance affects students’ English skills, such as acuity in micro-and macro-linguistics analysis, improved digital literacy, enthusiasm for learning, and self-potential development <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. This study aimed to analyze the impact of using the self-regulated learning method with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s in the speaking class. This review is a quantitative study with a pre-test and post-test design that was executed between October 2020 until January 2021. 110 students were chosen as samples in this study. An English-speaking rubric has been used to obtain data; that data was then analyzed by a software application that is SPSS 24.0, which was proceeded by qualitative description. The findings demonstrate that using a self-regulated learning method with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> assistance has positively impacted student speaking ability. This increased effect is demonstrated by the adjusted mean score on the post-test = 82.32. English instructors are encouraged to apply this method by considering students’ characteristics, cognitive capacities, learning styles, learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and the steps of how to apply this method in the instruction process.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:lightgreen">Chat</span>bots are tools that have the potential to effectively support interpersonal communication and interaction. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Chat</span>bots can provide great opportunities in education. The use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots in education can be used to employ interactive methods, to provide learners information and different types of info, and to guide learners. Indeed, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots promise to enhance learning experiences by creating more interaction than traditional teaching practices provide. In this context, the purpose of this study is to apply <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bot technology as a guidance tool in educational environments and to model its effects on visual design self-efficacy, engagement, satisfaction, and learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> at the end of the process. The participants of the study are 86 university students. In this study, data were collected with 4 different scales. Data were analyzed using the variance-based structural equation model with the partial least square method. As a result of the study, it was found that students with higher <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bot usage satisfaction had higher visual design self-efficacy. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Chat</span>bot usage satisfaction positively affects some aspects of course satisfaction. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Chat</span>bot usage satisfaction affects engagement.

<p>The purpose of this article is to extend knowledge and understanding of work in the platform economy by focusing on the phenomenon of (video)blogging on and around <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms. The growth of the platform economy has attracted considerable attention in recent years. As yet, however, research has focused almost exclusively on labour platforms that operate to match the supply of and demand for paid work in fields such as food delivery, ride hailing, cleaning or data entry activities. Surprisingly little is known about work and its manifestations on other platforms, despite the fact that the platform economy embraces a huge variety of arrangements for income generation. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 18 German (video)bloggers we show that (video)blogging constitutes a specific form of ‘digital self-employment’ that combines features of traditional self-employment with digitally mediated dependencies. While (video)bloggers enjoy both a great deal of independence from managerial control and a high degree of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, they are also subject to the rules and algorithms set by large tech companies. The example of (video)blogging, together with the experiences of (video)bloggers, highlights the extent to which the platform economy has created new types of work that need to be taken into consideration to enable a deeper understanding of the evolving dynamics of the platform economy and how these are transforming the nature of work.</p>

<p>According to current concepts of developmental tasks, both the use of digital media and the consumption of psychotropic substances are age-typical challenges for adolescents. The majority overcomes these developmental tasks, but a substantial proportion of youth develops problematic usage patterns (e.g., of video games) or problematic consumption behavior (e.g., of alcohol). Empirical findings show the importance of family aspects for these problematic behavior patterns. Currently, it is not clear which specific areas of parent-child relationship are associated in each case and whether there are differences between substance-related and substance-unrelated problematic behavioral patterns.We surveyed 480 adolescents (45.2% females, mean age = 16.84 years) with standardized instruments regarding the mother-child relationship as well as problematic gaming, problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use, and problematic alcohol use. We conducted correlation and multiple linear regression analyses (separately for problematic gaming, problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use, and problematic alcohol use) as well as a multivariate multiple regression analysis.In the regression analyses, more conflicts with the mother were related to all three behavioral patterns. However, lower cohesion was only statistically significantly associated with problematic alcohol use, but not with problematic gaming and problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use, whereas lower <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and more frequent punishment of the child were statistically significantly related to problematic gaming and problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use, but not to problematic alcohol use.The findings indicate partially different relational dynamics for substance-related and substance-unrelated problem behaviors (interestingly, for cohesion and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, the 95% confidence intervals of the standardized regression coefficients were not overlapping). The results of the present study could be used in family-based prevention approaches or in treatments in the clinical setting.</p>

<p>Studies on self-determination theory (SDT) have placed satisfaction of basic psychological needs (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, relatedness, and competence) at the core of well-being, whereas frustration of these needs results in multiple potentially unhealthy mental and behavioral patterns. This study analyzed how need satisfaction and frustration relate to the severity of gambling and gaming problems.A survey study with 18-75-year-old Finnish participants (N = 1530; 50.33% male) was conducted in April 2021. Basic psychological needs were measured with the Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction and Frustration Scale, mental health issues with the five-item Mental Health Inventory, gambling problems with the Problem Gambling Severity Index, and gaming problems with the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> Gaming Disorder Test. Zero-inflated negative binomial analyses were conducted to examine how satisfaction and frustration of basic psychological needs, together with mental health issues, are associated with gaming and gambling problems.Mental health issues were associated with gambling and gaming problems, but this association became nonsignificant when basic psychological needs were added to the model. However, better mental health still was associated with the absence of gaming problems. While need satisfaction had no association with the absence of gaming or gambling problems, need frustration was associated with increases in the severity of both gaming and gambling problems.Frustration of basic psychological needs for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, relatedness, and competence is associated with both gambling and gaming problems and should be considered when developing treatment and support for those who experience such problems.</p>

<p>Objective. The objective of this study is to know the integration process of Digital Technologies of Information and Communication (DTIC), facilities and limits perceived by professors of an undergraduate course in Nursing. Methods. Descriptive and exploratory study, with a qualitative approach, carried out in 2018, with nine professors from an undergraduate Nursing course at a public university located in the interior of Ceará. For the data production process, semi-structured interviews were conducted and content analysis was carried out. Results. DTIC have been integrated into teaching practices from different perspectives, in theoretical and practical activities, using mobile practice simulation applications, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networks, links to website</span>s, WhatsApp® groups and video-lessons. Furthermore, the integration of these technologies increases the creation of strategies that promote the active participation of the student, offering spaces for reflection, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, as well as the development of creativity and collaboration. Teachers highlight interactivity and communication, access to resources that are not available at the University, such as anatomical models, simulators of nursing procedures. Among the limits, structural issues, access to the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>, absence of institutional policies and permanent education are factors that demand greater attention for an effective pedagogical integration of DTIC. Conclusion. Although it represents an initial process of use, there is a potential for continuity and expansion of DTIC in different environments and disciplines. Efforts have been undertaken by teachers to integrate these technologies into the context of pedagogical activities in the Nursing course.</p>

The ascertaining research was used as an empirical method.the results of the research. An extensive use of the concept of online study-ing and the development of its technical internal system capabilities have led to significant changes in the understanding of this term. We define it as a global as-sociation of computer networks, an integrated network, web-sites, consisting of different communication networks integrated into a single logical online system. However, this definition no longer covers all aspects of this phenomenon. Accor-ding to the field of Online Psychology we mean online studying not as a specific network of interconnected computers and mobile devices, or even a network of web-sites with channels and communication devices between components with appropriate programs and protocols, as networks together with social services based on them, which attract people and / or ensure their activities. conclusions.

<p>In many parts of the economy, technology plays an increasingly important role in the control and management of workers. In this presenter symposium, we bring together four studies that offer novel insight into different dimensions of the relationship between technology and work, including behavioral experiments, identity control, the importance of social and cultural context, and effects for professional identity and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Our studies taken together show the importance of technology in a wide range of settings—platform-mediated work, such as ride-hailing and software development, platform-work, such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Instagram</span> influencers, and professional work performed in labor and delivery wards. By offering examinations of the intersections between technology and control in a variety of work contexts, both newer and more traditional, using both quantitative and qualitative methods, our symposium promises novel insights into the evolving and future role of technology in relationship between work and workers.

<p>Background and Purpose: English for Specific Purposes (ESP) instruction in Iran is still mostly focused on traditional ways. This study aims to investigate ESP teachers’ and students’ perceptions of integrating <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>y (ICT) in ESP instruction to solve traditional ESP instruction problems in Iran.
 
 Methodology: This concurrent parallel mixed method study investigated students’ and teachers’ perceptions of solving ESP instruction problems through ICT. The sample concluded 300 undergraduate engineering students and 24 experienced and novice ESP teachers. In the quantitative phase of the study, data were collected through two adapted questionnaires. In the qualitative phase, data were obtained from interviews with 12 undergraduate students, three experienced, and three novice ESP teachers.
 
 Findings: The findings revealed that the participants had positive perceptions of integrating different ICT tools for solving the problems with traditional ESP materials and methods, problems with low language skills, lack of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, demotivation problem, inactivity problem, and problems with lack of exposure to real-life situations. The findings also showed that integrating different ICT tools and ICT-based interactive activities promote students’ communication skills subconsciously through experiencing direct participation in communications.
 
 Conclusion and Contributions:he findings might contribute significantly to change the ESP instruction status quo in Iran, which is not based on the ESP students’ communication needs, and replace it with innovative approaches to meet the needs of the modern ESP student. The results also provide a unique outlook of promoting ESP instruction in tertiary education by integrating ICTs through divergent stakeholder perceptions.

<p>The psychic transformations the teenager is subjected to are generated by the needs and requirements he experiences, not only by the puberty needs, which take other forms now, but also by the needs emerging at this level of growth. In this article we will talk about the emotional needs of the teenagers, related to the online environment and we will consider both constructive behavior and what parents should avoid in their relationship to their children. Teenagers’ connection to their own emotional needs (safety, belonging, empathy and honesty, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, trust, spontaneity, etc.) as well as the involvement of the parents in gratifying them reflects in the degree of vitality and well-being of the child. Apart from the undeniable benefits, the development of the technology and the accessibility of the online environment also draw undesirable consequences which can lead to major damage of psychic, social and school functioning. It is essential for the parents to be present in their teenagers’ life, be available and informed about the age characteristics, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> traps, ways of preventing the risks in the online, influencing and maintaining their children’s excitement and joy, as well as spontaneity and innocence.</p>

<p>Online higher education teaching and learning has become a new normal in many countries due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, the support for online learning seems inadequate to address students’ diverse online learning needs and may impede the inclusiveness in higher education. Therefore, based on a questionnaire administered to higher education students in Sri Lanka, this paper examines the support or lack of support students have experienced during the university closure that may enable or hinder inclusive online learning. It draws on Self-Determination Theory (SDT) as a theoretical lens to analyse and make sense of these enablers for and barriers to inclusive online higher education. The key findings suggest that students first need <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support to access stable and affordable <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and devices, and quality online learning resources. They also need competence support for monitoring and managing their own learning through feedback and scaffolding as they engage in their learning online. Finally, they need relatedness support for reducing their anxiety and having a sense of connectedness by interacting and communicating with teachers and students.</p>

<p>Public trust in health systems is pivotal for their effective and efficient functioning. In particular, public trust is essential for personal data use, as demonstrated in debates in many countries, for example, about whether data from COVID-19 contact tracing apps should be pooled or remain on individuals’ <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s. Low levels of public trust pose a risk not only to health system legitimacy but can also harm population health.Synthesising our previous qualitative and theoretical research in the English National Health Service which enabled us to conceptualise the nature of public trust in health systems, we present guiding principles designed to rebuild public trust, if lost, and to maintain high levels of public trust in personal data use within the health system, if not.To build public trust, health system actors need to not rush trust building; engage with the public; keep the public safe; offer <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to the public; plan for diverse trust relationships; recognise that trust is shaped by both emotion and rational thought; represent the public interest; and work towards realising a net benefit for the health system and the public.Beyond policymakers and government officials, the guiding principles address a wide range of actors within health systems so that they can work collectively to build public trust. The guiding principles can be used to inform policymaking in health and health care and to analyse the performance of different governments to see if those governments that operate in greater conformity with the guiding principles perform better.</p>

<p>Abstract Older adults’ <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use has been shown to be a double-edged sword, linked to health and social benefits but also creating vulnerabilities. Similarly, the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s and other <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICTs) in organizations also affords workers advantages, such as increased flexibility, while exposing them to risks such as exhaustion and distress. This research examines older workers’ <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use and identifies a contextual characteristic that may buffer the negative implications of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use for work purposes. Following the job demands–resources (JD-R) model, we hypothesized that older workers’ daily work-related <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use is positively related to their experienced stress and negatively related to their mood, and that these relationships would be attenuated by work scheduling <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. We conducted an experience sampling method (ESM) study with a sample of 38 workers (ages 50–64) who completed daily measures over 8 days, and tracked their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use objectively using screenshots of time spent using various apps. Contrary to our expectations, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use was not significantly related to stress or mood. There were significant cross-level interactions, such that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use for work was negatively related to experienced stress and positively related to a positive mood for those with lower levels of scheduling <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. We interpret these findings and discuss the effects that technology use for work may have on older workers’ well-being through the lens of the JD-R model. Our results suggest that ICT use in the workplace combined with work scheduling <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> may not be advantageous for workers’ well-being.</p>

<p>Physical Education is rooted in physical movement and exploration and is usually held outdoors to make teaching and learning more accessible and meaningful. Since the pandemic happened, schools adopt a new teaching-learning modality which create new host of obstacles for Physical Education teachers, especially in teaching practical skills in Physical Education to the students due to its characteristics. This becomes now challenging to monitor students’ progress in performing the skills or whether students have acquired/performed the skills correctly. This study aims to explore the strategies and techniques in the teaching of practical skills in Physical Education in the new normal. This study also identifies the effectiveness and hindrances of the strategies and techniques used. The findings of this study serve as a basis in formulating a framework for enriching contemporary curriculum discourse in physical education of senior high public schools in Tagbilaran City during the school year 2020-2021. Physical Education teachers used a variety of ways in the new normal to effectively teach practical skills in Physical Education, rather than depending solely on printed modular instruction. In teaching the practical skills, task teaching and students submitting video performances were employed. Because of the nature of modular distance learning, students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for learning is one of the contributing elements to the difficulty of teaching practical skills in physical education. Many students have not yet established sufficient learning <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, resulting in learning gaps and preventing them from developing practical skills in physical education. Adding to that is the lack of needed resources such as gadgets and poor <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> connections.</p>

<p>The workplace in the 21st century has changed dramatically, as the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> connected the world, the “gig economy” changed work arrangements, globalization expanded the job market and individual work values such as <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and freedom became dominant (Rabenu, 2021). Just a few years ago, automation and technology were the heart of the conversation on the modern workplace and seemed to be replacing meaningful human connections. However, the COVID-19 pandemic, that required social distancing, demonstrated just how much people still need each other, and how technology cannot replace human relationships. The Positive Organizational Scholarship (POS) movement that started in the early 2000’s seeks to understand the role of positive relationships at work. The place of work in our lives makes it a source of meaning, purpose and identity-building, that are often created through positive relationships (Ragins &amp; Dutton, 2007). For example, high-quality relationships enable human flourishing that in turn benefits the organization (Dutton &amp; Heaphy, 2003). Another notable outcome of the movement is the Reflected Best Self Exercise (Quinn, Dutton, Spreitzer, &amp; Roberts, 2003) that helps understand individual strengths through feedback from significant others. The purpose of this symposium is to contribute to understanding the role of positive relationships in the workplace. This collection of papers explores different types of work relationships with leaders, coworkers and work friends to examine how positive emotional connections help overcome challenges and promote well-being. By looking at processes on different levels of analysis, this symposium offers a broader perspective on workplace relations and unique roles they can play for employees and for organizations.
