<p>This study analyses the psycho-educational and social paths of women prisoners after the time they drop out of school as minors, based on different variables related to <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and their preparedness to face temporary release.Qualitative and quantitative methods were used to analyse a national sample of 310 women prisoners (30.1% of the population) in 31 prisons through a mixed-mode questionnaire and interview. We analysed the significant association of variables related to dropout and obtained a log-linear model that relates dropout to recidivism and Roma culture. Work experience was analysed using the McNemar test, and variables influencing the participant’s job at the time of the study were analysed by applying cluster analysis.Young women comprise 66.6% of individuals who drop of the education system as minors (primary 49.3% and secondary 22%). They drop out between the ages of 7 and 17, and have traits of greater vulnerability than those who stayed in school until adulthood. In this population, we find a significant association with various factors: belonging to Roma culture, having family members in prison and delinquent recidivism; and higher unemployment (43.4%) and low income before entering prison. This situation is increasing today. In prison, these women had more connection to education/training, which can improve their employability. They also encounter difficulties with personal security, decision-making, personal/professional dependence, planning for the future, administrative matters and handling <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies, job-seeking skills, etc. Their self-perceived strengths are, however, assuming responsibility, taking orders, respecting schedules and timetables, working on a team and feeling prepared to start a job, as well as having optimistic convictions about the future.The vulnerabilities and risk factors studied have a negative influence primarily on processes of personal, social and job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in female minors who left the education system. Yet these minors show factors of protection and resilience. On temporary release at the time of the study, they face the consequences that their prison terms and incarceration have for their perceptions, attitudes, competencies and future prospects, as well as social marginalization and stigma. Early, coherent socio-educational interventions are thus needed to improve social integration-reintegration.</p>

<p>Before being an exaltation to Luddites (the English workers from the 19th century who actually destroyed textile machinery as a form of protest) or to some sort of technophobic movement, the provocative pun contained in the title of this article carries a methodological proposal, in the field of critical theory of information, to build a diagnosis about the algorithmic filtering of information, which reveals itself to be a structural characteristic of the new regime of information that brings challenges to human emancipation. Our analysis starts from the concept of mediation to problematize the belief, widespread in much of contemporary society, that the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques for algorithmic filtering of big data will provide answers and solutions to all our questions and problems. We will argue that the algorithmic mediation of information on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>, which is responsible for deciding which information we will have access to and which will remain invisible, is operated according to the economic interests of the companies that control the platforms we visit on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>, acting as obstacle to the prospects of informational diversity and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> that are fundamental in free and democratic societies.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and communication technolog</span>ies are a step forward in education, as they have given rise to innovative methodologies, such as blended learning. This type of training can be applied at any stage or educational typology such as basic vocational training. The main objective of this article is to know the degree of effectiveness of this methodology in this stage, specifically in an applied science module. For this purpose, a quasi-experimental design has been applied with a control group and an experimental group with a total of 147 participants. The results show how those students who have worked through b-learning have experienced better results in all the dimensions of the study. In conclusion, the implementation of this methodology in basic vocational training brings benefits, such as motivation and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the teaching–learning processes of all students.</p>

<p>This paper reports on a forum featuring four presentations on learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> research, all with practical applications. The paper gives an overview of the purpose of the forum, a short summary of each of the presentations, a discussion of some of the main themes and methods, and a summary of the ways in which the forum themes were continued to be investigated through the Q&amp;A session and in follow-up recordings and interviews. The four projects described in the paper are: the role of classroom teachers in fostering out-of-class, autonomous language learning, exploring online peer interaction in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s, examining the relationship between students’ agency and affordances for learning when studying abroad, and investigating learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in a self-access context from a self-determination theory perspective.</p>

<p>The study of the problems of the formation of the conceptual ap para tus in the field of legal support of artificial intelligence to develop effective le gal solutions in order to regulate new digital technologies. The work is based on a set of general scientific and special legal methods, including analysis, description, ge ne ra li zation, com parative law. The formation of legal definitions of artificial intelligence and related concepts (ro bot, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-physical system, etc.) requires the identification of the main legal fe atures of artificial intelligence. The following key characteristics of artificial in tel li gence are identified: optional hardware implementation; the ability of the system to analyze the environment; <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in operation; the ability to accumulate experience, its assessment and implementation of the task of self-learning; the pre sence of “intelligence”, described through the categories of “rationality”, “rationality” or simply the ability to “think like a person” or “act like a person” in all or in narrowly defined circumstances. Future legal regimes of artificial intelligence should take into account the possibility of weak artificial intelligence as a kind of complex thing and strong artificial intelligence that will “require” new legal solutions. The formation of legal definitions in the field of artificial intelligence must meet the requirements of universality, system city and ethics, and also allow, based on the selected properties, to establish systemic hierarchical relationships between concepts used in the field of artificial intelligence. The study develops the theoretical and practice-oriented provisions of in for mation law in matters of legal support for artificial intelligence, and also creates the basis for the formation of legislation in this area. The work can be used in further research activities on the legal regulation of the development, functioning and use of artificial intelligence systems.</p>

<p>This study sought to investigate the impact of using Cambly, a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">computer-mediated</span> communication tool, on the speaking proficiency of English as a foreign language (EFL) learners. Further, it aimed to explore the participants&amp;rsquo; perceptions of using Cambly. The study employed an experimental design featuring a mixed-methods approach to data collection that involved pre- and post-testing of the participants&amp;rsquo; speaking proficiency as well as semi-structured face-to-face interviews. The study sample consisted of 28 EFL university students who were divided into the control and experimental groups. The participants in the experimental group used Cambly to conduct audio calls with native speakers of English over a period of 4 weeks. The quantitative analysis of the participants&amp;rsquo; speaking proficiency tests revealed no significant differences between the experimental and control groups&amp;rsquo; post-test scores. Moreover, no significant differences were found between the experimental group&amp;rsquo;s pre- and post-test scores. The qualitative analysis of the participants&amp;rsquo; interviews revealed that the use of Cambly had a positive influence on their speaking proficiency, motivation, anxiety level, speaking opportunities, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, social relationships, and cultural awareness.</p>

<p>In the context of the reformation of the higher education in Ukraine the preparation of translators and interpreters requires new approaches to the process of teaching and learning. It presupposes the implementation of ways and forms aimed at active rather than passive learning, an increased sense of academic <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, development of motivation, responsibility and accountability in acquiring profession-specific knowledge, skills, communicative abilities and attitudes as well as interdependence and mutual respect between the academic teacher and the student.
 The authors of the article argue that the language tuition to students majoring in translation studies contributing to the overall development of their professional competence of intercultural mediators can be carried out in the form of extra-curricular activities via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y tools.
 With respect to the results of the grounded study of current tendencies, achievements and problems, valuable experience and outcomes related to the issue under consideration, the paper reflects on two extra-curricular activities, their stages, aims, objectives and tasks performed; analyses their importance and efficiency in promoting students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and responsibility; outlines the role and the functions of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y tools used.
 The English Speaking Club involves specially arranged meetings intended to provide practising English autonomously outside the classroom context. Participating in conversations with a native speaker students have the opportunity to improve their vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation skills, enrich their background knowledge of traditions and culture of the English-speaking countries as well as overcome psychological barriers while expressing personal views and ideas.
 Translation and Voice Over Recording Studio is organised as a project activity tailored to initiate student translators and interpreters to the real workflow of a project team specialising in translation of different types of audio and video texts in the English language into Ukrainian and their further voice over recording. Performing roles of translators, proofreaders, editors, voice-over artists and sound directors, the participants have the opportunity to practically implement knowledge, skills and communicative abilities obtained while learning profession-specific subjects at the university, developing and improving translation and interpretation skills in particular. Specially selected <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y tools provide the efficient organisation of the Club’s and Studio’s work.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social media</span> platforms have increasingly become an important way for news organizations to distribute content to their audiences. As news organizations relinquish control over distribution, they may feel the need to optimize their content to align with platform logics to ensure economic sustainability. However, the opaque and often proprietary nature of platform algorithms makes it hard for news organizations to truly know what kinds of content are preferred and will perform well. Invoking the concept of algorithmic ‘folk theories,’ this article presents a study of in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 18 U.S.-based news journalists and editors to understand how they make sense of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> algorithms, and to what extent this influences editorial decision making. Our findings suggest that while journalists’ understandings of platform algorithms create new considerations for gatekeeping practices, the extent to which it influences those practices is often negotiated against traditional journalistic conceptions of newsworthiness and journalistic <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.</p>

<p>In an effort to elucidate an aspirational vision for the food system and explore whether the characteristics of such a system inadvertently set unattainable standards for low-wealth rural communities, we applied discourse analysis to the following qualitative datasets: (1) interviews with food experts and advocates, (2) scholarly and grey literature, (3) industry websites, and (4) <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> exchanges between food advocates. The analysis revealed eight aspirational food system discourses: production, distribution, and infrastructure; healthy, organic, local food; behavioral health and education; sustainability; finance and investment; hunger relief; demand-side preferences; romanticized, community led transformations. Study findings reveal that of eight discourses, only three encompass the experiences of low-wealth rural residents. This aspirational food system may aggravate the lack of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and powerlessness already experienced by low-wealth rural groups, perpetuate a sense of failure by groups who will be unable to reach the aspirational food vision, silence discourses that might question those that play a role in the inequitable distribution of income while sanctioning discourses that focus on personal or community solutions, and leave out other policy-based solutions that address issues located within the food system. Further research might explore how to draw attention to silenced discourses on the needs and preferences of low-wealth rural populations to ensure that the policies and programs promoted by food system experts mitigate poor diets caused by food insecurity. Further research is needed to inform policies and programs to mitigate food insecurity in low-wealth rural populations.</p>

<p>Purpose : This descriptive study investigates the genesis and change in physical educators’ <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use for professional development and learning. Method : Data were collected through semistructured interviews with 48 physical educators who had actively used various <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> professionally for an extended period of time. The data were analyzed inductively and aligned to the basic psychological needs defined by self-determination theory: relatedness, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and competence. Results : Building relationships with a trusted network of people and opportunities to express their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> were important drivers in the participants’ genesis and continued use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. Developing competence at both the start and throughout their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> journey was also critical. Discussion/Conclusions : The findings provide a starting point for in-depth research on the motivational characteristics underpinning physical educators’ reasons for starting and continuing to use <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> for professional development and learning, and how these might change over time based on different psychological needs.</p>

<p>Background: Research has supported the cost-effectiveness of cognitive training tools enhanced by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICT) in several populations, including individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and age-related cognitive decline. The implementation of ICTs in this population, however, is sometimes challenging to their cognitive and age characteristics. Ultimately, this might compromise the effectiveness of ICT-enhanced therapies in this population. The aim of this study is to test the usability and acceptability of a European project prototype for elderly care, in an attempt to explore the ICT design needs of users with MCI. Methods: Participants were 28 individuals aged 58–95 years and with a diagnosis of MCI. Results: The results showed a low perception of peripheral elements and the need to place main interaction elements in the centre of the screen. The correlation between the general level of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (daily life activities) and the ICT <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> level was significant and positive. The speed of audio help had a significant impact on performance. Conclusion: The present work contributes to the literature on ICT usability needs of users with MCI. Some usability recommendations for designing interfaces for this type of user are provided in the text.</p>

<p>The new wave of digitization and the ensuing <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netic loop lead to the fact that biological, social, and cognitive processes can be understood in terms of information processes and systems, and thus digitally programmed and controlled. Digital control offers society and the individuals in that society a multitude of opportunities, but also brings new social and ethical challenges. Important public values are at stake, closely linked to fundamental and human rights. This paper focuses on the public value of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and shows that digitization—by analysis and application of data—can have a profound effect on this value in all sorts of aspects in our lives: in our material, biological, and socio-cultural lives. Since the supervision of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is hardly organized, we need to clarify through reflection and joint debate about what kind of control and human qualities we do not want to lose in the digital future.</p>

<p>The article discusses the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> technologies in the implementation of autonomous foreign language teaching for students of non-linguistic universities. The analysis of various pedagogical approaches to the definition of the category of “autonomous learning” as a special type of educational activity. The possibilities of using ICT in the process of offline learning a foreign language for students of non-linguistic universities are described. The advantages of using the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> when teaching a foreign language are given, the means of instruction, the types of independent work when using information technologies, information technologies are identified. A model of the educational process organization on the basis of students’ educational <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> technologies is presented, examples of the corresponding exercise system using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> technologies are substantiated and given.</p>

<p>This article examines the emerging phenomenon of the non-use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">WeChat</span> Moments. Drawing upon semi-structured interviews with 21 users who used Moments for at least 6 months, then voluntarily discontinued their use of the feature, we discuss the complex dynamics of Moments use, exploring the implicit micro-behavioral process of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> practice. Countering the purported hyper-centrality of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">WeChat</span>, we identified a periodic loop of “use, non-use, reuse” of Moments, suggesting that people suspend their use of Moments periodically to “re-domesticate” technology. Through the prism of the domestication approach, we argue that the re-domestication of Moments is a “reboot” of the whole process of domestication through four key stages: re-appropriation, re-objectification, re-incorporation, and re-conversion. Re-domestication is a process that allows people to take a retrospective look at their lives and transform Moments from a disruptive app feature into an instrumental apparatus conducive to their personal and professional well-being. By examining this process, we discuss how people use innovative ways to regain their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and agency in their daily interactions with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">WeChat</span>.</p>

<p>The redefinition of the objectives of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) generates novelty in the teaching design developed by universities. The constructivist perspective encourages the use of methods that promote teamwork, an interest for information searching, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and an increased motivation for learning, among others. Currently, the acquisition of the established curricular content receives feedback thanks to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICTs). This research describes the implementation of an experience related to the use of teaching/learning participatory methods with first- and second-year students in Early Childhood Education and Primary Education bachelor’s degrees. This experience is based on flipped classrooms and role-playing and is supported by ICTs. A questionnaire was delivered to a total of 100 individuals on their perception of participatory methods and their assessment of the methods used for the described experience. After performing the analysis, the conclusions showed that higher education students considered that classroom implementation of emerging methods helped them at a theoretical, practical and professional level as well as motivated them, which allows us to advance towards the goals of the EHEA.</p>

<p>Digital societies come with a design paradox: On the one hand, technologies, such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things, pervasive and ubiquitous systems, allow a distributed local intelligence in interconnected devices of our everyday life such as smart phones, smart thermostats, self-driving cars, etc. On the other hand, Big Data collection and storage is managed in a highly centralized fashion, resulting in privacy-intrusion, surveillance actions, discriminatory and segregation social phenomena. What is the difference between a distributed and a decentralized system design? How “decentralized” is the processing of our data nowadays? Does centralized design undermine <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>? Can the level of decentralization in the implemented technologies influence ethical and social dimensions, such as social justice? Can decentralization convey sustainability? Are there parallelisms between the decentralization of digital technology and the decentralization of urban development?</p>

<p>We are currently experiencing a new revolution, which is related to the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, nanotechnology, biotechnology and robotics. Artificial intelligence is based on intelligent algorithms or learning algorithms similar to human intelligence, technologies make it possible for computer systems to acquire independence, self-adaptive reconfiguration. The greater the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of AI, robots, and androids, the less they depend on manufacturers, owners, and users. The fact that the new generation of robots will coexist with humans should be taken into account in legislation, it should adapt and regulate issues of great legal significance, namely: who takes responsibility for the actions or inaction of intelligent robots? What is their legal status? Should they have a special regime of rights and obligations? How to resolve ethical conflicts related to their behavior? The analysis of legislation and doctrine in Latin America has revealed some trends in the use of AI. 1. The use of AI in various spheres of public life causes legal problems in terms of guaranteeing human rights, as evidenced by the analysis of the constitutions of Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. For example, article 8 of the American Convention on Human Rights states: “Everyone has the right to have his case heard, with appropriate guarantees and within a reasonable period of time, before a competent, independent and impartial court convened in advance by law in support of any criminal charge brought against him or to determine his rights or obligations of a civil, labour, financial or any other nature.” 2. The similarity of AI and human intelligence raises the question of legal personality of AI, granting AI rights. The civil and commercial code of Argentina departs from the category of “human person” and establishes the term “legal persons”: “all persons to whom the legal system grants the ability to acquire rights are legal persons for the purpose of fulfilling their purpose and obligations”. The line between things and people is becoming more blurred, technology and a more sensitive view of other living beings lead to doubt whether man is the sole subject of law.</p>

<p>Psychological needs dissatisfaction has been identified as hindering adaptive development, in which <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> need dissatisfaction, as one core component, may be associated with adolescents’ maladaptive online behaviors. Sporadic research has examined the association between <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> need dissatisfaction and problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> use (PMPU). Boredom proneness and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> gaming were suggested to be linked to this association. This study aimed to examine the mediating effects of boredom proneness and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> gaming in the association between <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> need dissatisfaction and PMPU. A total of 358 secondary school students completed questionnaires at three waves; <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> need dissatisfaction was measured in time 1 (T1); boredom proneness and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> gaming were measured one year later (time 2, T2); PMPU was measured two years later (time 3, T3). The structural equation model results showed that T1 <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> need dissatisfaction not only directly predicted T3 PMPU, but also exerted effects via the mediating role of T2 boredom proneness and the chain mediating role of T2 boredom proneness and T2 <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> gaming. These findings reveal the unique role of specific psychological need in engaging PMPU, which provides support to targeted interventions, such that promoting <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> need satisfaction may be an instrumental procedure to prevent adolescents from addiction-like online behaviors.</p>

<p>We tested if challenges to basic psychological needs (BPN) for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness during the COVID-19 pandemic undermine people’s mental well-being. Furthermore, we tested if an intervention, affirmation of these psychological needs, enhances mental well-being. Results of Study 1 ( N = 153) showed that higher levels of satisfaction of BPN were related to higher well-being during the COVID-19 outbreak. In Study 2 ( N = 215), we employed an online intervention enhancing these BPN. We found increased mental well-being through bolstered relatedness in particular. The intervention also decreased perceived stress. Both studies showed that mental well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic is positively related to the ability to work as usual and the number of people contacted via phone or <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> but not in person.</p>

<p>With globalization, digitalization, and the spread of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies, rules regulating work have been softened or completely abolished. As a consequence, employees face additional cognitive demands to plan, structure, and coordinate their work. In order to capture these demands of contemporary work, we constructed and validated the Cognitive Demands of Flexible Work (CODE) scale. The scale comprises four subscales (i.e., structuring of work tasks, planning of working times, planning of working places, and coordinating with others). We validated the scale in three independent samples (N = 1129) in both English and German. Confirmatory Factor Analyses supported the four-factor structure as well as the metric invariance of the different language versions. Moreover, the subscales showed convergent validity with related constructs such as requirements for problem solving or <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Criterion validity for emotional exhaustion, engagement, and problem-solving pondering suggests that cognitive demands of flexible work organizations can be construed as challenge stressors. However, relationships with emotional exhaustion only showed when <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> was controlled for. Overall, the CODE scale was shown to be a reliable and valid instrument to measure cognitive demands of flexibly organized work.</p>

<p>The growing gig economy has emerged as a significant theme of discussion in the world of work. Involving dynamic multi-party working arrangements between workers, digital platform organizations and requesters (i.e.&nbsp;customers), the gig economy is reshaping our understanding of the working relationship. Competing narratives around gig work explore the supposed <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> afforded to workers, the disruptive role of the algorithmic management function, and the challenges created by various legal ambiguities. This symposium aims to advance our understanding of this relatively novel phenomenon by examining key issues that exist in gig work and the most critical implications for HRM and employment relations scholarship. In addition to these perspectives, we explore several other contexts by sharing novel insights on the ramifications of gig working for information systems, conflict management, and legal debates. For organizations, our symposium examines the concept of algorithmic management in gig work, its role in implementing HRM activities, and its impact in shaping worker <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. For workers, we provide insights on how individuals may enact the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> provided to them by platforms, how workers may respond if expectations of flexibility are unmet, and the legal complexities arising from the fragmented nature of gig work. For requesters, we explore the novel role that customers hold in implementing HRM activities in gig work via rating mechanisms, and the subsequent implications for workers. Finally, our discussant will integrate the studies, draw theoretical and practical conclusions, and offer suggestions for advancing the topic.

<p>Enterprise <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> (ESM) have become imperative technologies in contemporary organizations, in part, due to promised improvements of efficiency and coordination. Given that past studies have primarily focused on the potential merits of these emerging technologies, less is known about the hidden power dynamics involved in the enactment of ESM. In this paper, we present the findings of an ethnographic study at a startup accelerator in which we examined how and why the enactment of ESM shapes and (re)produces power dynamics. Based on our analysis, we develop a process model that theorizes the emergence of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>–control tensions in the enactment of ESM through continual drifts of decision-making between the online and offline worlds. As we show, these drifts are produced through non liquets and the emergence of urgency. Furthermore, we demonstrate the consequentiality of these dynamics, which turn ESM into an irreducible part of organizational processes. Our findings contribute to the burgeoning literature at the intersection of emerging technologies and organizing by surfacing power-related, potentially detrimental side effects inherent to organizing through such technologies.</p>

<p>SummaryThe <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the students refers to the control that the student has in the learning process, to decide on the content, the goals and the way of learning and is connected with the concepts of self-direction and self-regulation. The concept of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> presupposes the development of a psychological relationship with the process and the content of the learning act, while the autonomous student is able to make decisions, to distance himself but also to reflect critically. <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> is related to the notion of personal responsibility that the learner assumes in his learning process, while two dimensions are distinguished. The first is autonomous learning, in which the learner assumes responsibility for the design, organization and evaluation of the educational process, which concerns its external characteristics. The second is the autonomous student, which refers to the internal characteristics of the learner. However, an important factor for the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the students is considered to be the context in which the educational process takes place, ie when the general socio-political and learning context encourages the learners to take responsibility for their learning, then their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is promoted.In the context of distance education, students are at a distance from their teachers, their classmates and the institution that provides education, but they are called to meet the requirements of the study program they choose. And while the concept of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is intertwined with the method of distance education, the factors that hinder its realization have not been sufficiently explored. This empirical research, therefore, comes to fill the gap in the literature on the obstacles that students themselves face in the realization of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.This paper explores the barriers faced by distance education students in achieving their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. In particular, it focuses on exploring the obstacles that students face with regard to <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in distance education and the factors that contribute to removing the obstacles to student <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in distance education. The quantitative approach was chosen and the tool of our research was the online questionnaire, which was completed by 215 research participants, postgraduate and undergraduate students of the Hellenic Open University. The selection of the sample was random sampling as the questionnaire was published on a social networking page (<span style="background-color:lightgreen">facebook</span>) in specific groups formed by the Hellenic Open University students and the participants chose to answer and complete the questionnaire. The empirical research took place in March - April 2019.The questionnaire included two axes. The first axis concerned demographic data. The second axis included twenty-one (21) questions that answered the research questions. Seventeen (17) of the questions were closed-ended, graded Likert scale, one (1) question with answer options, while three (3) questions were open-ended. Open-ended questions were included in order for participants to express their views on the obstacles they face, and to enrich the data from the closed-ended questions.For the analysis of the data collected from the closed-ended questions of the questionnaire, the statistical program SPSS and the descriptive statistics were used. Regarding the data of the open-ended questions, after their inclusion in broader categories, the next step was to codify the conversion of the data from nominal to numerical. In order to identify any differences in the answers of the participants, depending on the gender and the level of studies, correlations were used.The theoretical framework of the present study is closely related to the empirical research carried out. Obstacles to the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of distance learning students identified in the theoretical part are confirmed by the empirical research, with the difference that the empirical research has shown that students’ personal characteristics as well as the “distance” factor do not constitute a significant obstacle to the realization of their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.However, the empirical research also revealed several factors that were not identified in the bibliographic review as barriers to student <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, such as inadequate administrative organization, financial factors, the small number of group meetings, the lack of different types of papers, exams based on memorization and exams with books closed. It is also worth noting that while the majority of students consider that they have developed skills in order to be autonomous, they agree that a preparatory course that would prepare them for the requirements of distance education would be very helpful. The analysis and discussion of the results highlighted the prominent role of the teacher in distance education, as the lack of support for students can impede their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, however, the teacher has the potential to contribute to its realization by guiding and encouraging students. The multidimensional role of the teacher in distance education also emerges from our research, as described in the theoretical part of our work, since the participants expressed the need for teachers combining a number of characteristics in order to promote their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.Another important finding of the research is that students feel their personal characteristics and personal abilities can help them realize their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. In line with the bibliographic review, the factors that are an obstacle to the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the students of distance education, as well as the factors contributing to the removal of these obstacles, are related both to the students themselves and to the educational process.As for the factors that contribute to the removal of barriers to the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of distance learning students, they coincide with the factors that have a positive effect on the realization of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and have been identified in the theoretical framework of our work. The most important factor is the personal characteristics of the students themselves and their own personal effort. Following, the support, guidance from the teacher on a psychological and practical level and communication with him. Also very important factors are the existence of appropriate educational material and the conduct of group meetings, which students ask to be more frequent.The need for a digital learning framework to promote student <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, as found in the theoretical framework, is confirmed by the empirical research, as well as the need for electronic group meetings and the use of electronic libraries, access to specialized digital material, and easier access to the Hellenic Open University platforms.A very important factor in removing the barriers to student <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> as it emerged from the empirical research is more flexible schedules concerning the delivery of papers, while access to educational material and a better administrative organization are also considered important.Regarding the correlation of the curriculum with the factors that constitute an obstacle to <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, the majority of postgraduate and undergraduate students agree with some differentiation regarding the factors “comments of the teacher on written work”, “educational material”, “psychological support from the teacher”and“ lack of psychological support from the teacher” while gender did not appear to have any particular effect on the factors that impede students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span></p>

<p>The patient–doctor interaction has changed profoundly in the past decades. In reaction to paternalistic communication patterns, health policy makers have advocated for patient-centered care and shared decision-making. Although these models of medical communication remain still aspirational, patients have become more engaged in advocating for their own health in encounters with physicians. I argue that the engaged patient is a more accurate conceptualization of the changing role of the patient than patient consumerism, the empowered, or expert patient. I examine how the emergence of engaged patients influences the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of health professionals, relates to the rise of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> as an alternative source of medical information, centers the role of the patient–doctor interaction in public health epidemics, and contributes to health inequities.</p>

<p>The development of the information society causes a new direction of socialization – media socialization, especially it’s relevant for young people, who is an active media consumer.The essence of the notions of «media space», «media socialization», «<span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> socialization» are analyzed in the article. The features of the media space functioning are considered, taking into account the factors of socialization, its functions are represented in accordance with the traditional socialization process. The influence of the media on the socialization process is determined as a condition for the further development of the components in the youth media socialization. The principles of youth media socialization in the conditions of media space are offered (system, activity, bilateral interaction of personality and virtual reality, media activity and critical thinking). The components of the media-socialization process are presented (forms, mechanisms, agents of media-socialization, etc.). The indicators of successful and unsuccessful media socialization are indicated. The basic conflict of media socialization is determined, which affects its result (the balance of virtual and real).The media socialization criteria with corresponding levels of development and indicators is offered in the article (media adaptability, media <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, media activity). The levels of media-socialization of youth are presented in conditions of modern media space.The study of the process of youth media socialization was confirmed by the high percentage of respondents with low (38.5%) and medium (41.8%) levels of media-socialization. At the same time, the high level of media-socialization was characteristic only for 19.7% of respondents.The issue of media socialization of young people becomes acute in connection with the situation that has developed in the state. The system of social education institutions faces the challenge of initiating changes in young people entering into the media space, which in the future will create effective conditions for development taking into account media resources. The problem of youth media socialization is not limited to the research conducted. Promising areas of scientific research can be: development of socio-pedagogical conditions and technology of media-socialization of the individual; development of methodical support for the implementation of media-socialization technology in general educational institutions; introduction of foreign experience of youth media socialization into practice of social work.</p>

<p>User created content (UCC) is created and shared by common users on line. From the user’s perspective, the increase of UCCs has led to an expansion of alternative means of communications, while from the business perspective UCCs have formed an environment in which an abundant amount of new contents can be produced. Despite outward quantitative growth, however, many aspects of UCCs do not meet the expectations of general users in terms of quality, and this can be observed through pirated contents and user-copied contents. The purpose of this research is to investigate effective methods for fostering production of creative user-generated content. This study proposes two core elements, namely, reward and motivation, which are believed to enhance content creativity as well as the mediating factor and users’ committement, which will be effective for bridging the increasing motivation and content creativity. Based on this perspective, this research takes an in-depth look at issues related to constructing the dimensions of reward and motivation in UCC services for creative content product, which are identified in three phases. First, three dimensions of rewards have been proposed: task dimension, social dimension, and organizational dimention. The task dimension rewards are related to the inherent characteristics of a task such as writing blog articles and pasting photos. Four concrete ways of providing task-related rewards in UCC environments are suggested in this study, which include skill variety, task significance, task identity, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The social dimensioni rewards are related to the connected relationships among users. The organizational dimension consists of monetary payoff and recognition from others. Second, the two types of motivations are suggested to be affected by the diverse rewards schemes: intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation. Inrinsic motivation occurs when people create new UCC contents for its’ own sake, whereas extrinsic motivation occurs when people create new contents for other purposes such as fame and money. Third, commitments are suggested to work as important mediating variables between motivation and content creativity. We believe commitments are especially important in online environments because they have been found to exert stronger impacts on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> users than other relevant factors do. Two types of commitments are suggested in this study: emotional commitment and continuity commitment. Finally, content creativity is proposed as the final dependent variable in this study. We provide a systematic method to measure the creativity of UCC content based on the prior studies in creativity measurement. The method includes expert evaluation of blog pages posted by the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> users. In order to test the theoretical model of our study, 133 active blog users were recruited to participate in a group discussion as well as a survey. They were asked to fill out a questionnaire on their commitment, motivation and rewards of creating UCC contents. At the same time, their creativity was measured by independent experts using Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking. Finally, two independent users visited the study participants’ blog pages and evaluated their content creativity using the Creative Products Semantic Scale. All the data were compiled and analyzed through structural equation modeling. We first conducted a confirmatory factor analysis to validate the measurement model of our research. It was found that measures used in our study satisfied the requirement of reliability, convergent validity as well as discriminant validity. Given the fact that our measurement model is valid and reliable, we proceeded to conduct a structural model analysis. The results indicated that all the variables in our model had higher than necessary explanatory powers in terms of R-square values. The study results identified several important reward shemes. First of all, skill variety, task importance, task identity, and automony were all found to have significant influences on the intrinsic motivation of creating UCC contents. Also, the relationship with other users was found to have strong influences upon both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Finally, the opportunity to get recognition for their UCC work was found to have a significant impact on the extrinsic motivation of UCC users. However, different from our expectation, monetary compensation was found not to have a significant impact on the extrinsic motivation. It was also found that commitment was an important mediating factor in UCC environment between motivation and content creativity. A more fully mediating model was found to have the highest explanation power compared to no-mediation or partially mediated models. This paper ends with implications of the study results. First, from the theoretical perspective this study proposes and empirically validates the commitment as an important mediating factor between motivation and content creativity. This result reflects the characteristics of online environment in which the UCC creation activities occur voluntarily. Second, from the practical perspective this study proposes several concrete reward factors that are germane to the UCC environment, and their effectiveness to the content creativity is estimated. In addition to the quantitive results of relative importance of the reward factrs, this study also proposes concrete ways to provide the rewards in the UCC environment based on the FGI data that are collected after our participants finish asnwering survey questions. Finally, from the methodological perspective, this study suggests and implements a way to measure the UCC content creativity independently from the content generators’ creativity, which can be used later by future research on UCC creativity. In sum, this study proposes and validates important reward features and their relations to the motivation, commitment, and the content creativity in UCC environment, which is believed to be one of the most important factors for the success of UCC and Web 2.0. As such, this study can provide significant theoretical as well as practical bases for fostering creativity in UCC contents.</p>

<i> Rosemary Wahu Mbogo </i></p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;Covid-19, a disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and in Kenya in March 2020. In Kenya, the Covid-19 pandemic has brought to light some unknown talents among the stakeholders at different levels. The economic sector has had manufacturing potential for goods, and from mass media reports, this has been demonstrated through production of Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs), ventilators and innovations in technology in the creation of apps such as the Linda App for contact tracing and Gumzo, a video conferencing app. Similarly, the education sector has also demonstrated potential for adaptation in some situations. For example, after all institutions of learning were closed to prevent the spread of coronavirus in March 2020, many universities have continued learning through Online, Distance and E-learning (ODEL) platforms, and some have even conducted virtual graduations. Others like Kenyatta University have reported innovations such as development of ventilators and modified testing swabs for Covid-19. This is admirable despite numerous limitations of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> accessibilities and other shortcomings. This remarkable achievement has been possible due to semi-<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the university education sector, where Senates are given the right and power, by the Education Act, to make autonomous decisions for their universities which are regulated and monitored using the standards and regulations set by the Commission of University Education (CUE). However, other levels of the education sector do not have this <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and have had to depend on the ministry of education for guidance. On 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; July 2020, the ministry of education announced the result of a consultative meeting with stakeholders, to postpone the reopening of schools to January 2021. This was due to the rising cases of corona virus infections in May and June, steeping the infection curve, expected to reach the peak by November and to have flattened by January 2021 (Magoha, 2020). However, what surprised many was the additional and unforeseen announcement that all basic education students (apart from standard 8 and form 4 examination candidates whose details were not clarified) will repeat their current class levels in 2021. The pronouncement caused anxiety and has attracted mixed reactions from various stakeholders. The purpose of this paper is therefore to explain the leadership decisions made by the ministry of education analyze their impact on basic education and propose possible ways for educational leaders and administrators, community leaders and volunteers to facilitate home-based education during the Covid-19 pandemic. This should be done with a goal for progression and promotion of students to the next class level when the 2020 syllabus is eventually covered. The study method utilized desktop literature research where interactions with educational leaders, scholars and practitioners were used to investigate threats and opportunities in managing education during crises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Article visualizations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=“/-counters-/edu_01/0641/a.php” alt=“Hit counter” /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has been a major stressor. Emotional and behavioral self-regulation can change when there is a threat/challenge to the three basic psychological needs for competence, relatedness and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Psychological knowledge, especially the Motivational Theory of Coping, about processes of coping with stress and its consequences on physical and mental health supported the proposal of a booklet, aiming to assist in the health and well-being promotion. The material was assessed online by eight judges regarding their understanding of language, content and relevance. The final version has 16 pages, illustrated, organized in three sections: Introduction, Identifying stress responses and Coping strategies related to the basic psychological needs. For each of them, the Booklet presents three charts, pointing out “Difficulties”, “What to avoid”, “What can be done”, and space for notes. This translation of scientific knowledge into promotional and psychoeducational material can be useful for lay people and can be used in health services, and it is available on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>.</p>

<p>Introduction: This article mainly through the literature research method and content analysis method, has carried on the analysis to the university turnover classroom. This paper analyses the characteristics and development trend of flipped classroom research from the aspects of research fields, research topics, research methods, literature sources, author information and references. Method: This teaching method undoubtedly fully demonstrates the concept of quality education, that is, while respecting students ‘individual differences in learning, it also cultivates students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, allowing them to learn independently and develop their ability to analyze and solve problems. The flipped classroom uses the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> as a platform to adjust the teaching steps, which has changed the organization of teaching and learning, class and off-class, teaching and self-study. Result: Teachers can supplement other resources on the Flipping classroom. At the same time, according to the content of the textbook, the teacher should design the test questions. In addition, teachers should also participate in the discussion of students before class, answering questions for students online. Throughout the online learning process, teachers can obtain students’ mastery of the unit’s knowledge points through the support of big data, such as which knowledge points are difficult, which ones are mastered, and which students are well mastered, so that the teaching can be effectively adjusted. plan. The main content of the teacher in the pre-course period is to check the content of the student’s reply in the classroom exchange area to understand the students’ knowledge of the knowledge points. Conclusion: It can be seen from the above column chart that the following conclusions can be drawn through the investigation and study of the factors affecting the College psychology teaching in colleges and universities. University leaders have a certain degree of emphasis on College psychology courses, but teaching management needs to be Further improvement; the number of people in some psychology majors is too high. Some colleges and universities in the teaching objectives of psychology special courses lack the target requirements of students’ social adaptation and scientific research; most of the teachers’ theoretical teaching content is not comprehensive enough and the content is single. Discussion: This article is based on an in-depth analysis of the advantages of domestic SPOC platforms and flipped classrooms, and analyzes the course goals of psychological teaching in colleges and universities. A teaching model of psychological courses based on the SPOC platform was constructed. This article is based on the teaching of psychology, and discusses the problems related to the flip reading teaching of psychology. The purpose is to sort out the theoretical and practical problems of flipped reading teaching in psychology lessons, and better adapt to the teaching of psychology lessons in the new era and new technology.</p>

<p>The growth of older adults in new regions poses challenges for public health. We know that these seniors live increasingly alone, and this impairs their health and general wellbeing. Studies suggest that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s (SNS) can reduce isolation, improve social participation, and increase <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the characteristics of older adult users of SNS in these new territories. Without this information, it is not possible to improve the adoption of SNS in this population. Based on decision trees, this study analyzes how the elderly users of various SNS in Chile are like. For this purpose, a segmentation of the different groups of elderly users of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networks was constructed, and the most discriminating variables concerning the use of these applications were classified. The results highlight the existence of considerable differences between the various social networks analyzed in their use and characterization. Educational level is the most discriminating variable, and gender influences the types of SNS use. In general, it is observed that the higher the educational level, the more the different social networking site</span>s are used.</p>

<p>Gaming Disorder is a recognised mental health condition with a very narrow range of treatment options. This pre-post study recruited 50 adult gamers from New Zealand to test the feasibility of a brief <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>-delivered intervention. The intervention components were derived from Implementation Intention principles whereby the gap between intention and behaviour was targeted. The intervention delivery was in accordance with Self-Determination Theory to facilitate <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (personalised goals and action plans), competence (facilitated coping plans, self-monitoring, and relapse prevention) and relatedness (access to a goal coach providing written feedback and support to implement plans). Follow-up evaluation at 3-months indicated the intervention was feasible as it demonstrated rapid recruitment, program engagement (86% used the program), and high satisfaction (easy to understand and convenient). Plans most frequently focused on behavioural substitution and lifestyle change, and the most frequent barrier to change was time management followed by social pressure. Completers (n ​= ​35) reported a significant increase in well-being and reduction in severity, intensity, and time spent gaming, which reduced from an average of 29 to 11 ​hours per week. Delivery of a brief <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>-delivered intervention shows promise and could be used to treat people experiencing problems who are unable or unwilling to access face-to-face treatment. • A brief intervention is associated with reduced gaming time and frequency, and symptom severity. • 88% of participants elected to reduce gaming, with just 12% planning abstinence. • Time management and social pressure are the most salient barriers to change. • Personalised change plans most often target substitution and lifestyle change. • Brief and focused coaching can facilitate engagement with an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>-delivered program.</p>

Drawing from Self-Determination theory (SDT), the program aimed at satisfying teachers’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness needs and facilitating their autonomous motivation. Pre-post measurements showed significant improvements in key variables that can determine training success. Preliminary quantitative group insights supported by qualitative data revealed enhanced participatory dynamics in terms of members’ interaction. Findings suggest that PE.T.Co.N. is a promising, innovative approach to teacher training. Implications are discussed in light of SDT. • PE teacher in-service training can be delivered effectively as a CoP through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> groups. • <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> appears a promising tool to tackle the attrition issue in on-line training. • PETCoN participation leads/contributes to increased <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> need satisfaction. • PETCoN increases relatedness need satisfaction and decreases relatedness frustration. • Self-determination theory is well suited when designing teacher in-service training.</p>

<p>The Corona Virus outbreak has impacted various sectors of various countries all over the globe and the education sector is one of those sectors that are impacted by COVID-19 even worse as compared to the other sectors. To ensure the continuity of learning and education, various educational institutes used the concept of online learning using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y. The effectiveness of education through online learning has been a great challenge for the students as well as for the teachers. In this regard, the current study has been designed with the motive to find out the impact of teacher’s perceived technological knowledge, teachers e-<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and ICT pedagogical practices on the technology integration in knowledge delivery along with the mediating role of perceived effect of teaching with technology on students in the educational institutions of Pakistan. The data was collected from 447 teachers teaching online through ICT and the results were obtained through the analysis of the collected data. The results have suggested that all the independent variables i.e.&nbsp;teacher’s perceived technological knowledge, teachers’ e-<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and ICT pedagogical practices are having a significant impact on the technology integration in knowledge delivery. On the other hand, in case of mediating role of perceived effect of teaching with technology is considered, it is found significant in case of only teacher’s perceived technological knowledge and teacher’s e-<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> but in case of the relation between ICT pedagogical practices, the mediating role of PETT is not significant.</p>

<p>In a networked society, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> has become central to individuals’ lives. It has enabled people to access information, interact with communities, share experiences, find entertainment, and learn. This paper explores an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>y on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Instagram</span> where members connect by sharing narratives, stories, memories, and other accounts of foreign language learning. The research seeks to assess the ways an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>y on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Instagram</span> can be a learning network. It also investigates the affordances perceived by the community members in their language learning histories (LLHs). The analysis revealed that the community matches the network principles proposed by Downes (2012): <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> , diversity, openness, and interactivity. Also, LLHs reveal that, in their personal learning networks, narrators have perceived affordances to interact with foreign language speakers; explore multimodality; make connections between native and foreign language; interact with technologies and cultural artifacts; practise repetition; find personal connections with the foreign language; participate in fandoms; and pay attention to foreign language speakers. The stories shared in the learning network indicate that the actions upon affordances perceived in informal environments seem to have a positive impact on learners’ linguistic repertoires, identities, and emotions.</p>

<p>The field of me<span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>ronic/robotic wearable exoskeletons, specifically those designated for assistance/rehabilitation in severe neuro-/locomotor disabling conditions in the lower limbs, is considered to have a great potential for radically changing the harsh condition of wheelchairs users, by restoring their defining human traits: bipedal, vertical, stance and gait. But even the most advanced such complex devices, are not yet effectively able to largely replace the wheelchairs. Therefore, until the overall complete wheelchairs’ substitutes, will meet, in this purpose, all the necessary related requirements, we have determined, and accordingly, designed – from a double perspective: of professionals and of (a) consumer – a series of necessary and rather accessible/feasible, consistent: mechanical and electro-mechanical improvements, to the current common type of wheelchairs, in order to improve the global functioning, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and consequently, the quality of life in the needing people, with severe mobility restraints. These, for now, narratively innovative concepts and specifically designed, practical/technological-constructive solutions, target 10 main kinds of beneficial outcomes, i.e.&nbsp;a decalogue and their derivatives to be expected (most of them previously imagined by us but not completely designed until now, two of them already achieved but which need updating and other four entirely new), that could result in an “all-in-one” product paradigm which, to our knowledge, is not available at present. This model of wheelchair we propose is, at the same time, modular, so a certain consumer can purchase/ be offered only his/her own case-specific needed optimization components of it</p>

<p>This article examines the representation and use of quality time. It brings together an analysis of images tagged and shared under the hashtag #qualitytime on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Instagram</span> with an investigation into the trope’s resonance in everyday life. In the interviews and profiles studied in this article, people used the term to indicate and display instances of self-determined solitude or of fulfilling conviviality in which <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> were conspicuously absent. At the same time, the notion required them to carve out and valorize moments of purpose, a goal that was often unattainable. Use of the hashtag was thus accompanied by both the opportunity and the obligation to aspire to temporary retreats in which free time was employed for meaningful activity. This means that the somewhat pretentious keyword signifies the ideal of temporal <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> while also pointing to the slim chance of finding uncompromised spells of time within harried leisure.</p>

<p>Purpose Knowledge withholding is an important but under-studied topic, which refers to the phenomenon that individuals give less than full effort to contributing knowledge. This study aims to investigate the differential effects of task characteristics on individuals’ knowledge withholding behavior in online space, this study develops and empirically verifies a theoretical model that covers the five core task characteristics in job characteristics model (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, identity, feedback, skill variety and significance), knowledge sharing self-inefficacy and withholding effort in sharing knowledge. Design/methodology/approach Using an online survey method, this study collected empirical data from 351 general <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> users from 30 provincial administrative units in China. The data were analyzed using the structural equation modeling technique of partial least squares. Findings The analysis results indicate that <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> negatively affects, while identity, skill variety and significance positively affect users’ knowledge withholding behavior in online space through the mediation of knowledge sharing self-inefficacy, and that three task characteristics (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, identity and feedback) strengthen the relationship between knowledge sharing self-inefficacy and knowledge withholding. Practical implications This study provides valuable insights for reducing knowledge withholding behavior in online space. Operationally, different levels of task characteristics such as <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, identity and feedback can be set to prevent users from perceiving themselves as inefficacious, and to weaken the behavioral expression of knowledge sharing self-inefficacy. Originality/value This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the differential effects of task characteristics on knowledge withholding in online space, and improves the cognition of the boundaries of withholding effort in sharing knowledge in online space.</p>

<p>Abstract The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> has led to a rearrangement of the public and private spheres. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social media</span> in particular have contributed to the blurring of boundaries between public and private as they allow for unrestricted self-representation via text, images, and video to a more or less unlimited online audience. More than ever, individuals are thus forced to take into account questions of un/desired observability. For a critical analysis of this development, this article draws upon Jürgen Habermas’ The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere and Beate Rössler’s The Value of Privacy . Both authors argue that the modulation of publicness and privacy is intertwined with the process of individuation and hence concerns the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the individual, as self-realization depends upon responses from others, but also upon the ability to withdraw from public scrutiny. Drawing upon their findings, the article discusses if and how <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> enhance or delimit self-realization and therefore serve or hinder individuation and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.</p>

<p>Abstract Modern organizations must use the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, digital and mobile devices to respond to business demands efficiently. It is also imperative for practitioners and researchers to understand the adverse effects of problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and mobile device usage in the workplace. Moreover, findings from existing studies are insufficient or less relevant or lack applicability in the context of workplace safety behavior. This paper contributes to the literature by examining the mechanisms in which problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> usage lowers workers safety behavior and the moderating role of time <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Data was obtained from workers in the Turkish maritime industry using a simple random sampling technique (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;344) and analyzed with partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Results from PLS-SEM demonstrate that problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use reduces safety behavior and time <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> enhances safety behavior. Time <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> attenuates the negative impact of problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use on safety behavior. Unlike previous studies, this paper highlights the pernicious effects of problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use and beneficial effects of time <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in shaping modern workplace safety behaviors. Based on these results, several managerial prescriptions and theoretical implications are rendered, and future research directions are highlighted.</p>

<p>Purpose This paper aims to investigate the extent of intellectual capital disclosure (ICD) through websites and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> in Spanish local government (SLG) and analyze the factors that explain their disclosure. Design/methodology/approach The study applies content analysis and regression techniques. The ICD is analyzed for Spanish municipalities with more than 100,000 inhabitants and provincial capitals over a period from January 2018 to February 2020. Findings Findings emphasize that the quantity of disclosed information on intellectual capital (IC) is in the low level, particularly with regard to human capital (HC). Furthermore, the results show that the information provided via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> mainly concerns the relational capital (RC). On the other hand, results obtained indicate that larger municipalities, with lower financial <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and whose citizens have a high income level use the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online media</span> (both websites and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>) more actively to disclose information about IC. Finally, municipalities led by women and with high level of citizens’ education exert a positive influence in the ICD only on websites. Practical implications This paper makes a number of key contributions to the existing body of knowledge, focusing on ICD, a neglected area in the public sector accounting literature. It explores and identifies the supply-side and demand-side determinants of information affecting the ICD in local governments. The results of this research could be useful for policymakers, regulators and governments’ managers to improve the online information addressing ICD issues. Originality/value This paper adopts an innovative perspective by investigating the use of alternative tools for ICD in local government context (websites and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>). To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study that focuses on investigating the determinants of online ICD in local governments.</p>

<p>The study examines parental mediation strategies of adolescent <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use and their relation to adolescent age, concerns of online risks, online activities and risky behavior. Prior research on parental mediation is inconclusive about the effectiveness or superiority of any mediation strategy. Additionally, concerns and awareness of risks were not previously studied with respect to mediation strategies. A mixed-method study involved a survey of 357 adolescents ages 12–18 and 156 young adolescents ages 9–11, followed by semi-structured interviews with parents, teachers and adolescents. Various behavioral, attitudinal, perceptual and habitual aspects of adolescent <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use and types of parental mediation were measured. Results illustrate how parents combine mediation strategies in a variety of formats and contexts. Restrictive mediation correlated with increased adolescent concerns, suggesting an internalization of risks and consequences of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use. However, restrictive mediation correlated with decreased <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> activity and increased risks, possibly due to lack of adolescent experience and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in navigating online risks. Conversely, active mediation correlated with increased <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> activity of any sort, which enables experimentation and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in using the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, and did not correlate with risk. The study compares mediation strategies with parenting styles and concludes that a balanced combination of restrictive and active mediation, arguably supplies the best grounds for adolescents to develop a strong set of norms and boundaries and be able to self-regulate their own <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> activities.</p>

<p>Pregnant women are heavy users of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and this has an impact on their medical follow-up. The purpose of this study is to highlight the ethical issues related to the use of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> by women in their medical care.Through a systematic literature review conducted on PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, CINAHL and Embase between June and July 2019, 10 670 results were obtained, and 79 articles were included in the post-selection study. A thematic analysis was conducted on these articles.More than 90% of pregnant women use <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, particularly to find medical information and social support, mainly on pregnancy and childbirth. This research allows them more equitable access to knowledge and develops their empowerment, which modifies the relationship between caregiver and patient, through the acquisition of greater <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for women and the development of experiential knowledge. This access offers a central and active role to pregnant women in their medical care. However, many authors also agree on the possible abuses of this use: misinformation, disproportionate information and the presence of judgment that undermine empowerment, but also digital divide and inequity in understanding information, stigmatization of women, and risks of privacy breaches on data acquired online.In order to provide pregnant women with the central and active place they seek, the authors recommend involving caregivers in the referral to reliable sites, encouraging them to develop online content, and educating pregnant women in the search for health information on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>.</p>

<p>Public communication in digital space is entering a phase of profound change due to the redefinition of the forms of production, dissemination and use of content in institutional networks. This article contributes to research carried out on public communication news flows of SNSs, presenting an analysis focusing on the visual content posted on institutional information channels dedicated to young people and managed by youth policy actors. The content of photos was analyzed in relation to 6 categories of public communication topics, 3 categories of communication aims, 6 categories of visual elements and 10 thematic areas. The empirical basis consists of 702 images taken from 15 accounts of Italian and European youth policy <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Instagram</span> channels. The results show the main features of institutional flows on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Instagram</span> and a comparison with what has emerged from previous research projects relating to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span>. The findings focus on institutional topics and promotional aims and on the weaknesses of the flow of images in terms of social and political issues, engagement, public-service information, semantic <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and emotional impact. The limits that emerge from the research identify certain critical questions which indicate a need for further investigation with respect to relationships occurring between public news flows, young people, information requirements and social networks in the public sphere.</p>

<p>I am a married woman. I am also a working woman. I love what I do. And I am actually paid to do what I love. Yet, everyday I return home from work with a heavy heart. No.&nbsp;My workplace poses no threats. Although many working women across the world would disagree with me; but fortunately, I am not one of them. My greatest threat is my returning home to my in-laws and tolerating their snide comments on my being out all day. The men in the house can do it. That is not a problem. But my going and staying out to work is a matter of domestic debate. I usually don’t retaliate. But I cannot help brooding over, from time to time, how unfair life still is towards women. When you really think about it, the fact that women all over the world are still fighting for equal rights defies all logic. Humans have mastered flight, walked on the moon and created the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> but women still can’t be trusted to make autonomous decisions about their own bodies, be guaranteed freedom from violence or harassment or get paid the same amount as men for doing the same damn work. From time to time, many women have voiced their disgruntlement over the gender inequality. Anita Desai is one such powerful and persuasive voice among the writers, endeavouring in all her works to reflect the how the female <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> strives to prove its existence in a strictly patriarchal cultural pattern. This paper seeks to refer to one of her novels, Bye, Bye Black Bird (1971) to highlight the way man-woman relationships are bedevilled by cultural encounters. The novel deals with alienation of an English lady, Sarah, married to Adit, an immigrant from India, who spends her days wallowed in the guilt of committing a mistake of marrying an Indian in her own society. In spite of being a woman from the so-called advanced west, she is quiet, meek and submissive; while Adit, behaves most of the time, like a typical Indian male, conservative, rigid and patriarchal. Through Sarah, Desai draws our attention to the annihilation of self that marriage involves for a female, through a recurring theme of insecurity, fragmentation, homelessness and the quest for identity among different communities across the world.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has brought a significant impact on the in-person learning access to the on-campus Self-Access Center (SAC). Therefore, there is a need for an electronic Self-Access Language Learning (e-SALL) innovation to address the newly emerging issues in the field. This perspectives article suggests several ways of facilitating self-access learning using web-based technologies. It also includes some key technological and pedagogical considerations in providing in-person learning access beyond the school. We argue that the integration between a Learning Management System (LMS) as a web-based learning platform and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>-based materials and resources will sustain the in-person learning practice from a lens of technology and the pedagogy of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.</p>

<p>Indonesia is expected to reap the benefits of a golden generation, enjoying an advanced and independent modern society in the year of 2045. However, there are great challenges ahead including problems amongst younger Indonesians which may hinder the realization of this projection. This study brings to the fore the problem of teenage marriage, defined as the marriage of two individuals under the age of eighteen, be it through coercion or through their own volition. Data show that 14.18% of married Indonesian women are younger than 16 years old (SUSENAS, 2017); with 1.459,000 teenage girls marrying per annum so that the country ranks eighth globally in terms of teenage marriage (UNICEF, 2020). Using a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netics communication approach and qualitative method, this article assesses teenage marriage prevention programs in Rembang, a regency in middle Java, Indonesia. This study found that prevention of teenage marriage is not part of everyday discussion in the grassroots. Public discourse has stalled at the information stage, optimal understanding has yet to be realized. With this backdrop, Rembang regency utilize a top-down approach in organizing its teenage marriage prevention programs. However, synergy and cooperation remain necessary to minimize the practice by maximizing collaboration with families, schools, health officials, religious officials, and civil servants who turn to be the most influential actors in such programs.</p>

<p>Abstract. Previous research shows that perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support is significantly associated with positive health outcomes for different clinical populations. However, there is not a standardized measurement tool that assesses perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support for the Turkish population. This study translated the Health Care Climate Questionnaire (HCCQ), a perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support measurement tool, into Turkish and investigated the factorial structure of the questionnaire with a group of patients with cancer. This study used a convenience-sampling method with 192 people with cancer. The participants were recruited from a major cancer institute and a non-profit organization in Turkey by research partners. Volunteer participants either filled out a hard copy of a survey packet or completed the survey packet through a secured online survey tool website (i.e., https://www.surveymonkey.com ). In addition, a closed <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> group for cancer survivors in Turkey was used to advertise the study’s link. The results indicated the participants perceived a moderate level of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support. In comparison to German and US populations, perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support was low among Turkish cancer patients. The results also indicated that the HCCQ has a two-factor measurement structure. Correlations with external variables indicated that the scores of HCCQ were significantly positively associated with life satisfaction and quality of life of cancer patients and negatively associated with cancer related symptoms (e.g., fatigue).</p>

<p>Abstract Background Traditional approaches to antenatal education have been questioned as to their effectiveness. The use of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> for information-seeking is very prevalent, however sources are of varied quality. We explored the information-seeking behaviour of pregnant women in the context of health literacy skills and informed decision-making. Methods In a mixed-method descriptive study, 12 focus groups with a culturally diverse set of pregnant women and new mothers (N = 62), a non-participant observation study of antenatal education classes and a web-based questionnaire survey were performed (N = 200). The survey explored use and critical appraisal of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> sources of information, perceived role in assisting decision-making, user-provider interaction, alliance and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in decision making. Results Six themes emerged: in a generally “unsupportive system”, pregnant women want to have a “confident voice” but find themselves “self-navigating” in parallel worlds of formal and informal information, using a process of “supplementing and filtering”, sometimes instinctively and selectively, ending up in a state of “doubt and faith” with regards to the trustworthiness of the information and physician dominance in communication, while the “art of communication” is essential to break the cycle. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> information-searching is very prevalent, even though 60% characterize the information as misleading and 90% would like health professionals to recommend trusted sites. While the majority report discussing this information with their healthcare providers, only 57% characterize the reception as positive. Conclusions Women want to have control over decisions affecting their pregnancy. While the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> is a prevalent information source, they value the communication with their healthcare providers and want direction. Maternity healthcare professionals need to recognize the phenomenon, offer appropriate guidance and support shared decision-making. Key messages “Traditional” antenatal education arrangements are not effective in supporting informed decision-making. In a landscape of prevalent <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> use, a shift is needed from current practices of unguided information-searching.</p>

<p>Abstract In the era of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things (IoT), emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies provide various artificial <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> features that allow intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) to assist users in managing the dynamically expanding applications, devices, and services in their daily lives. However, limited academic research has been done to validate empirically artificial <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and its downstream consequences on human behavior. This study investigates the role of artificial <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> by dividing it into three types of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in terms of task primitives, namely, sensing, thought, and action <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Drawing on mind perception theory, the authors hypothesize that the two fundamental dimensions of humanlike perceptions—competence and warmth—of non-human entities could explain the mechanism between artificial <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and IPA usage. Our results reveal that the comparative effects of competence and warmth perception exist when artificial <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> contributes to users’ continuance usage intention. Theoretically, this study increases our understanding of AI-enabled artificial <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in information systems research. These findings also provide insightful suggestions for practitioners regarding AI artifacts design.</p>

<p>Background: E-learning is essential in health science education, and the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated its utility. Objectives: The study aimed to observe the changes in the scenario of e-learning in Indian Medical Education during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted on 905 undergraduate health science students who agreed with an online survey. A questionnaire was prepared, including sociodemographic details, utilization of commercially available e-learning programs before the pandemic, and the scenario of teaching-learning activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was validated and circulated among medical students of various states across India through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. Qualitative data were presented as numbers and percentages and quantitative data as mean (SD). Results: Of the 905 students surveyed, 69.17% (n = 626) were female students and 30.83% (n = 279) were male students. Besides, 85% (n = 395) of the students found commercial programs useful in clarifying concepts. Institutional e-learning was mandatory for 71.16% (n = 644) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the 644 students for whom e-learning was mandatory, 69.10% (n = 445) found tools like videoconferencing, Google classroom, zoom meetings, etc. useful in flexibility and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. However, 50.47% (n = 325) of the students preferred a combined method of classroom teaching and e-learning, whereas only 9.93% (n = 64) of students preferred only e-learning as a method of teaching. They were satisfied with institutional programs for clarifying concepts (n = 386; 60%) and communication skills (n = 320; 50%). Conclusions: The utility of e-learning has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, students preferred e-learning in combination with traditional teaching, especially in health science courses.</p>

<p>Amid growing precarity and zero hour contracts, the ‘gig economy’ represents a new way of working mediated by web technology. Workers can sign up to a work platform – a website or <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> program that manages the work automatically – and take on work at the tap of a button. Some platforms manage labour, such as driving for Uber or delivering food for Deliveroo, while others manage retail activity, such as Ebay or Etsy.&lt;br/&gt; Recent research has shown that a significant number of people are using platform work to earn money, with over half being young people aged 16-34. While there are some data regarding satisfaction levels and attractors, there is little research examining specific age segments of workers, or the relationship between platform work and career.&lt;br/&gt; Using data from focus group interviews with school and Further Education college students, this paper will discuss findings from research investigating how young people in England aged 16-19 perceive the gig economy and whether they feel that it will be relevant to their careers, with a view to discussing whether it may be necessary to include in careers education programmes or guidance.&lt;br/&gt; The interview data indicate that these participants were occasionally using platforms to make money, and a few were earning regularly, usually on retail platforms. While some interviewees appreciated the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and flexibility promised by gig economy work, the uncertainty, perceived low status, and lack of career progression prevented them from taking it seriously as a career option. Instead, they preferred traditional forms of work that provide more stability and organisational support - an increasingly rare commodity in a labour market that is changing rapidly in the opposite direction. We conclude that while there may be little value in giving detailed individual guidance on the gig economy, it could be valuable to use it as a way of teaching young people about the labour market and different types of employment</p>

<p>Abstract Sports associations have an interest in the maintenance of a level playing field among all participants. Athletes are therefore bound by the same sporting rules. This also applies to minor athletes who compete at the highest level of their sport. The disciplinary <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of sports governing bodies enables them to initiate sports investigations against minor athletes alleged of being in violation of sports regulations, including those pertaining to doping and match manipulation. During the investigations, minor athletes may be obliged to attend sports interrogations or grant full access to diverse of personal information and documentary evidence, including <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s, SMS and WhatsApp conversations, and health records. However, the vulnerability of young athletes requires sufficient protection of minors and safeguards in sports investigation proceedings. The aim of this article is to examine the legality of internal sports investigation proceedings against minors in respect to doping and manipulation of sports competition matters. In particular, it analyses whether it is legitimate and reasonable to use investigative measures contained in the regulations of sports governing bodies against minor athletes in the light of the principle of proportionality.</p>

<p>The European electronic communications market is preparing for the large-scale roll-out of 5G broadband networks, which is expected to revolutionise communications in the EU economy and in European societies. The introduction of 5G technology in Europe can build on an existing framework of electronic communications legislation which were adopted in the internal market harmonisation competences regulated in the legal base provided in art.114 TFEU. However, as revealed by the EU’s policy documents, 5G technology, as well as its suppliers, represent considerable internal security risks and pose a threat to Europe’s technological sovereignty and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The EU reacted to these challenges by securitising and politicising its 5G policy. These developments question whether its implementation can take place in internal market competences, and whether the EU alone possesses sufficient competences to secure implementation.</p>

<p>This article explores the intersection of autonomous <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> capabilities and two primary rules of international law—the respect for the sovereignty of other States and the prohibition on coercive intervention into another State’s internal or external affairs. Of all the rules of international law, these are the likeliest to be violated through employment of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> capabilities, whether autonomous or not. This raises the question of whether a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> operation that involves autonomous capabilities presents unique issues with respect to the application of the two rules. The article concludes that while there are numerous unsettled issues surrounding their application to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> operations, the fact that a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> operation employs autonomous capabilities has little legal bearing on the resolution of those issues. Rather, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> simply makes it more difficult, at least at times, to confidently apply the rules because of the uncertainty as to the consequences. Yet, these are dilemmas of fact, not law, and must be understood and acknowledged as such.</p>

<p>This study explored the interplay of adolescents’ perceived maternal and paternal practices and their associations with traditional and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying victimization experiences among adolescents. Participants included 439 Grades 7–11 adolescents (242 girls) from five secondary schools in Hong Kong. Moderation analyses were conducted controlling for adolescents sex. No strengthening effects were found between maternal × paternal control and maternal × paternal <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-support in relation to bullying victimization experiences. No buffering effect of parental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-support was evident in the association between parental control and traditional bullying victimization. However, high levels of paternal <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-support were associated with more frequent reports of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying victimization at high levels of maternal control but not low levels. A similar pattern emerged for maternal <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-support and paternal control. These findings imply that inconsistent parenting might increase adolescents’ likelihood for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying victimization.</p>

<p>Driven by digitization in society and industry, automating behavior in an autonomous way substantially alters industrial value chains in the smart service world. As processes are enhanced with sensor and actuator technology, they become digitally interconnected and merge into an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things (IoT) to form <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-physical systems (CPS). Using these automated systems, enterprises can improve the performance and quality of their operations. However, currently it is neither feasible nor reasonable to equip any machine with full <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> when networking with other machines or people. It is necessary to specify rules for machine behavior that also determine an adequate degree of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to realize the potential benefits of the IoT. Yet, there is a lack of methodologies and guidelines to support the design and implementation of machines as explicit autonomous agents such that many designs only consider <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> implicitly. To address this research gap, we perform a comprehensive literature review to extract 12 requirements for the design of autonomous agents in the IoT. We introduce a set of constitutive characteristics for agents and introduce a classification framework for interactions in multi-agent systems. We integrate our findings by developing a conceptual modeling language consisting of a meta model and a notation that facilitates the specification and design of autonomous agents within the IoT as well as CPS: the <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> Model and Notation. We illustrate and discuss the approach and its limitations.</p>

<p>Blended learning based on MOOCs (b-MOOC) has become a new and wide-spread approach to combining <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> technologies with face-to-face instruction in higher education. In the implementation of b-MOOCs, learning support or scaffolding proves to be essential and determines to some extent the success of blended learning, while available literature shows lack of re-search on it. Aiming at exploring a feasible learning support approach for b-MOOCs in practice, this study constructed a support framework with four key elements of resources (R), interaction (I), strategy (S) and evaluation (E) support, briefed as RISE, and implemented it in the Business English course in a Chinese university. A survey and semi-structured interview were conducted to make clear its effects, the perceptions and expectations of students. It shows that the RISE support initiative got wide recognition and resulted in various improvements, promoting learning <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, improving learning strategy, increasing interaction and time devoted. As to suggestions, more targeted and higher degree of support is expected by learners and they show preference for face-to-face instruction and suggestion is raised that the proportion of face-to-face section should be no less than the online part. The results of this study may offer practical reference in b-MOOC design about how to support learning process of students and what components and methods are effective.</p>

<p>Messaging apps such as WhatsApp collapse temporal and spatial distances and enable continuous interactions. At the same time, messaging apps blur boundaries by default and contribute to the blending of different relational contexts as well as the collapsing of absence and presence. Whereas existing studies have mainly focused on the blurring of boundaries between work and private life, this study expands beyond the personal/professional binary and considers boundary work in more nuanced relational contexts. In order to provide a better understanding of boundary work within messaging practices, we conducted interviews and focus groups with employees from a variety of Dutch workplaces, and with participants of WhatsApp neighborhood crime prevention groups. Our findings highlight two forms of boundary work strategies. First, respondents purposefully tinker with WhatsApp features to manage the boundaries between absence and presence. Second, they use <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> and WhatsApp functionalities to carefully construct segmentations between different contexts. The meaning of particular contexts, the materiality of messaging apps, and technical know-how play a crucial role in these boundary-sculpting practices. The importance of our study is in noting how the ongoing contradictions of messaging practices—being always available but always negotiating that availability—affect everyday experiences of freedom, privacy, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in significant ways.</p>

<p>Background Engagement with physical activity mobile apps has been reported to be a core precondition for their effectiveness in digital behavior change interventions. However, to date, little attention has been paid to understanding the perspectives, needs, expectations, and experiences of potential users with physical activity mobile apps. Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the features that are judged to be important for engagement with a physical activity mobile app and the reasons for their importance. Methods A qualitative focus-group methodology with elements of co-design was adopted in this study. Participants reporting sedentary lifestyles and willingness to improve their physical activity behavior through mobile technology were recruited. The focus group sessions consisted of 13 participants (8 men and 5 women, mean [SD] age 41.9 [7.1] years). Two researchers conducted the data analysis independently by using the inductive thematic approach. Results Four main themes emerged in relation to the research question and were named as follows: “physical activity participation motives,” “<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and self-regulation,” “need for relatedness,” and “smart.” Additionally, 2 subthemes originated from “physical activity participation motives” (ie, “medical guidance” and “weight loss and fitness for health”) and “smart” (ie, “action planning” and “adaptable and tailored”). Conclusions Features enhancing <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and self-regulation and positively affecting health and physical well-being as well as the need for relatedness, adaptability, and flexibility should be considered as core elements in the engagement of potential users with physical activity mobile apps. The emerged findings may orient future research and interventions aiming to foster engagement of potential users with physical activity apps.</p>

<p>This article addresses the centrality of images in the definition of a new paradigm for ageing, when health (measured by <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>) becomes a condition for freedom (associated with youth). Based on a 16-month ethnography conducted with older people (aged 50–80) in a middle-class district in São Paulo, Brazil, I found that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s empower older people to craft a health identity by engaging and producing content that highlights the positive aspects of ageing. In this community, health is a concept deeply associated with productivity, and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> becomes a space for participants to present themselves as busy, giving visibility to all of the activities they engage with. On WhatsApp groups, participants can also work as curators, sharing content that is in the public interest, which improves their collective experience of ageing and restores their sense of utility and dignity. I found that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s also allow participants to manipulate the mechanism of social comparison used to classify who is healthy and who is old. Often, when they have a condition or frailty, they confine themselves to online interactions, hiding from view the ageing body that could compromise their performance. By doing that, their declines are kept on the backstage of their social interactions, allowing participants to extend their presence within the third age, which is associated with freedom and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, while the decline related to the fourth age is kept in the shadows.</p>

<p>Global informatization is one of the dominant trends in contemporary social reality. Digital <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies have enormous innovation potential for the overall modernization and transformation of education and the enrichment of pedagogical sciences. Realizing this potential requires technologies to be fully integrated into educational practice. A high degree of integration is a prerequisite for the implementation of constructivism, increasing <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, personal responsibility of learners and the opportunity for personalized learning.
 Digital technological integration is a progressive change of education to a degree of transformation. In the process of gradual merging of information and communication and pedagogical technologies, innovative pedagogical practices are created, and they cannot be realized without modern technological means. The characteristics of the methods of teaching and learning with digital technologies determine different degrees of integration which are entry, adoption, adaptation, infusion, and transformation.
 The current features of the applied methods for using Information Communication Technology (ICT) in the Bulgarian secondary education in technology, and entrepreneurship (grades 5-7) were studied by surveying 127 pedagogues teaching this subject. A questionnaire is attached examining the goals, frequency use of digital tools in the educational process, and the applied management decisions for choosing the digital tools and working with them. The analysis of the obtained data showed that ICT was used, but the degree of integration was low and corresponded to the initial levels of entry and initial adoption of the integration process. In isolated cases, lessons were held according to how students performed in activities specific to their level of adaptation.</p>

<p>The online teaching accelerated at an unprecedented pace in the wake of the physical closure of educational institutions in the United Kingdom on 23 March 2020 due to the COVID-19 crisis. This study is based on a survey of mature undergraduate students in private higher education institutes in the South of England and their experience with online teaching during the COVID-19. The questionnaire was sent out to mature undergraduate students studying in three private higher education institutes, and we received 225 responses. A quantitative approach was used to analyse the results. Majority of students 95% were using online teaching for the first time, and they were novice with the online teaching software (Zoom and Microsoft Teams, etc.). They were provided with training for online teaching, especially how to use the software, and they were satisfied with the training. The study also identified challenges students faced during the online teaching such as weak <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> connection, old devices (computer and laptop etc.) low level of digital competency especially among older students, lack of technical support from the institute and stressful transition period. The final findings from the study indicated that the quick decision of switching to online teaching was right, and the majority of students found online teaching excited. Consequently, the majority of students wanted to continue online teaching after the COVID-19 because it provides ease and convenience, no travelling time &amp; cost, freedom and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The online teaching training for students could be made more effective, and private higher education institutions could also address challenges such as weak <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> connection and old devices (computer, laptop, etc.).

<p>This essay explores the digital challenge, how to humanize technology, and the need to rethink the digital-human divide. This is imperative in view of superintelligent Al, which may escape human control. The information age poses quandaries regarding the uses and abuses of technology. A major critique concerns the commercial design of digital technologies that engenders compulsive behavior. All technologies affect humans in a reciprocal way. The new digital technologies-from <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s to the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>—where humans are tethered to machines, can impair our <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, hijack attention, rewire the brain, and diminish concentration, empathy, knowledge, and wisdom. The remedy is to restore deep reading, human interactions, personal conversations, real friendships, and respect for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and privacy, building a nurturing culture of tolerance, coupled with transcendent norms and ideals worthy of a creature created in the image and likeness of God. This aspiration should be at the center of a new interdisciplinary field of inquiry—a phenomenology of communications.</p>

<p>This study extends our understanding of humble leadership as an important trust-engendering leadership style that influences employee behaviors. Drawing on social exchange theory, we articulate how humble leaders’ employee-centric behaviors signal trust and facilitate a social exchange relationship between leaders and followers. Specifically, we posit that a leader’s humble leadership behaviors are positively related to employees’ task performance and organizational citizenship behavior via feelings of being trusted by one’s supervisor. We also predict that the interaction between humble leadership and employee job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> will influence employees’ appraisal of feeling trusted. We tested our moderated-mediation model using experimental vignette data and three-wave survey data collected from 233 employees and their supervisors working at a large Chinese <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> company. Study results support our hypotheses that humble leadership, and its interaction with employee job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, contribute to feeling trusted by their supervisor. Furthermore, we found that humble leadership behavior, via enhanced perceptions of feeling trusted, predicted supervisor-rated employee task performance and organizational citizenship behavior toward the organization. The implications for theory and practice are discussed.</p>

<p>The problem of adolescent online gaming addiction is related to individual-level characteristics and the influence of the family environment. The present study explores the potential role of adolescents’ time management tendency in mediating the relationship between parenting style and adolescent <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> gaming disorder (IGD). Responses from a total of 357 Chinese high school students were collected for a Pathological Video-Game Use Questionnaire, Simplified Parenting Styles Scale, and Time Management Tendency Scale. Overall, participants reported moderate use of online games (Mean = 1.41; SD = 0.41), lower than the median value of 2 on a three-point scale. In terms of the mediating role of adolescents’ time management tendency, full meditation was observed for the relationship between the parenting style factor of “parents’ emotional warmth” for both mothers and fathers and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> gaming disorder. The results highlight the benefits of emotional warmth in supporting self-efficacy, self-control, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> through the promotion of time management, which is an important protective factor for IGD and can serve as a mediating personality variable. Although non-significant in the complete model, over-protection and rejection by parents should also be cautiously considered as potential risk factors related to addiction.</p>

<p>Technologies, especially <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>-based digital ones, are reshaping choice processes – actual considerations and actions, as well as perceptions of these – in massive, often fundamental, ways. In this paper, our goal is to explore choice processes in general, and especially choice processes in hyperdigital marketspaces (i.e., with massively, pervasively interconnected things) with examples drawn from U.S. macro consumption contexts. We start with a short review of discourses on choice and choicelessness and then shift to the emerging era of technology-shaped choice processes that are especially observable in contemporary hyperdigital marketspaces. For the increasingly large swaths of market segments that consume, indeed live, digitally, we find deft symbolic sublimations and inversions happening, wherein manipulation is perceived as <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> enhancing.</p>

<p>In this article, topics related to the urgent transition to distance education (DE), through decisive measures taken to protect Russian university community against consequences of COVID-19 epidemic are covered. Based on semi-structured interviews with administrators, faculty, IT specialists and students, it is argued that in the force majeure circumstances the university offers for DE a standard model of one-size-fits-all curriculum though modified through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies. The use of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> in a localized online space is limited to delivering courses without considering needs of individual learners, their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, preferences and prior knowledge of the subject. The observation method was used by both participant and non-participant. An experiment on the teachers’ self-assessment proves that many still view the university as a source of offline information for students. The article purports to discuss ways to promote DE by the concepts of postindustrial educational space connectivism, hyperconnectivity of social networks, teachers’ reflective practice, digital nativity of teachers and students in mastering <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies. It is claimed that real transition of a Russian university to DE cannot be achieved without <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>-provided increased transactional distance in the dialogue between the teacher and students mediated by technology and reflective approach.</p>

<p>Already a controversial topic, legal debate and broader discussions concerning the amount of human control required in the employment of autonomous weapons—including autonomous <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> capabilities—continues. These discussions, particularly those taking place among States that are Parties to the 1980 Certain Conventional Weapons Convention, reveal a complete lack of consensus on the requirement of human control and serve to distract from the more important question with respect to <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in armed conflict: under what conditions could autonomous weapons “select” and “attack” targets in a manner that complies with the law of armed conflict (LOAC).</p>
<p>This article analyzes the specific LOAC rules on precautions in attack, as codified in Article 57 of Additional Protocol I, and asserts that these rules do not require human judgment in targeting decisions. Rather, these rules prescribe a particular analysis that must be completed by those who plan or decide upon an attack prior to exercising force, including decisions made by autonomous systems without meaningful human control. To the extent that autonomous weapons and weapons systems using autonomous functions can be designed and employed in such a way to comply with all required precautions, they would not violate the LOAC. A key feature of determining the ability of autonomous weapons and weapons systems using autonomous functions to meet these requirements must be a rigorous weapons review process.</p>

<p>This interdisciplinary cross-cultural research explores antecedents for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> networking satisfaction for Spanish and American consumers. Conceptually rooted in a sense of community, self-determination theory, and Hofstede’s cultural dimensions, our descriptive study samples consist of n = 367 Americans and n = 161 Spaniards. Analysis with fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) interrogates two propositions to identify recipes. Proposition 1 indicates that <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is not a necessary ingredient for either culture; self-presentation in the virtual world need not mirror the true self to provide short-term virtual satisfaction. Proposition 2 suggests that both cultures value relatedness and competence as motivations for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> behavior. While Americans value interactivity more than their counterparts, Spaniards value competence more, to experience <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> networking satisfaction. Digital marketing managers must better understand cross-cultural differences and consider virtual value propositions offered to members of various cultures to better navigate the dynamic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> environment.</p>

<p>This study aims to examine the characteristics of grandparent–grandchild relationships made possible by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies (ICTs). An online questionnaire survey gathered the views of 169 grandmothers and grandfathers. On the one hand, it asked them generically about their possession of ICTs, their ICT skills, and their family relationships. On the other hand, it asked about their relationship with one of their grandchildren according to the ICTs used and the relational functions performed, particularly in relation to the age of the grandchild chosen. The grandparents who responded to our survey are very well equipped with ICTs and have good ICT skills. They frequently use them for both personal and family use. They communicate with their grandchildren in ways that are adapted to the grandchild’s age and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. These are more intense with the youngest grandchildren, and encourage a resumption of exchanges in later adolescence. While the choice of communication methods depends in part on the age of the grandchild, the relational functions performed seem to be more structured by the developmental stage of the grandchild than by the technical characteristics of ICTs. Our data also confirm that while ICTs can make it possible to maintain a link with grandchildren who live far away, they mainly enrich an otherwise existing relationship.</p>

<p>Purpose This study aims to explore the impact of ethical leadership on employee creative deviance, with job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> as a mediator and creative self-efficacy as a moderator between job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and creative deviance. Design/methodology/approach A survey was developed based on construct measures from the literature. A total of 316 responses were received from employees of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y companies located in China’s Pearl River Delta. Findings Both ethical leadership and job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> have a positive impact on employee creative deviance; job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> plays a mediating role between ethical leadership and creative deviance; creative self-efficacy does not have a significant moderating effect on the job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-creative deviance relationship. Research limitations/implications Future studies could explore the potential moderating role of both job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and creative-self efficacy in the link between ethical leadership and creative deviance. Practical implications This study recommends that organizations should adopt and promote an ethical leadership approach to manage creative deviance at work. Organizations could explore alternative methods of task completion to support the job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for the employees to mitigate the dilemmas associated with creative deviance. Originality/value This is one of few studies that examine the impact of ethical leadership on employee’s creative deviance, despite the fact that the influence of ethical leadership on the followers has been extensively examined.</p>

<p>Socialized product design (SPD) mode, enabled by advanced <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> technologies and sharing economic trends, has the capability of utilizing the design resources from large numbers of socialized designers (SDs) to carry out the design tasks that used to be participated by only the internal R&amp;D staffs of companies. During SPD projects, different kinds of mechanisms can be applied to organize the SDs. Some of them tend to be centralized control (e.g.&nbsp;crowdsourcing design) and some are more of distributed <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (e.g.&nbsp;opensourcing design). Both centralized control and distributed <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> have their strengths and limitations for SPD. Centralized control enables more organized, focused, and efficient project execution, but it limits the emergence of collective intelligence among the SDs. Distributed <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> helps to explore the innovation potential of SDs by granting them the freedom of communication and mutual inspiration, but it may cause the problem of unreliable and unpredictable design process. To complement the advantages of centralized control and distributed <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in SPD, an integrated model of Blackboard and Bayesian network is established in this paper. The Blackboard, whose Control modules are specially customized for human Knowledge sources, is for guaranteeing overall control of the distributed design process and at the same time permitting certain level of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to the SDs. The Bayesian network, built with an improved Bayesian causal map method, is an embedded Control module of the Blackboard which evaluates design solutions according to the incomplete collective judgments from SDs. The operability of the integrated model has been verified through a case study of 3D printer conceptual design project.</p>

<p>The 21st century is witnessing large transformations in several sectors related to <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, including energy, transportation, robotics, and health care. Decision making using real-time information over a large range of operations (as well as the ability to adapt online in the presence of various uncertainties and anomalies) is the hallmark of an autonomous system. To design such a system, a variety of challenges must be addressed. Uncertainties may occur in several forms, both structured and unstructured. Anomalies may often be severe and require rapid detection and swift action to minimize damage and restore normalcy. This article addresses the difficult task of making autonomous decisions in the presence of severe anomalies. While the specific application of focus is flight control, the overall solutions proposed are applicable for general complex dynamic systems.</p>

<p>Abstract In contemporary society, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICTs) are widely cherished for helping transnational households preserve a coherent sense of familyhood despite geographical separation. Despite ICTs having positive benefits for the maintenance of long-distance intimacies, digital asymmetries characterized by gaps in routines, emotional experiences, and outcomes of ICT use can also emerge between family members of different structural, social, and geographical conditions. Drawing on an innovative “content–context diary”-cum-participant observation, this article investigates the multi-dimensional digital asymmetries emerging from the transnational communication of Chinese “study mothers” in Singapore. Using the data visualization and analysis tool “ecomap,” the findings uncover that study mothers were largely beleaguered by expectation asymmetry and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> asymmetry, arising from different expectations to and control over daily transnational communication with their family members. The study mothers were disadvantaged by their relatively isolated life situations in the host society and accentuated gender hierarchies in the household.</p>

<p>To understand why <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms’ potency as a tool for manipulation is inadequately apprehended through content-neutral, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-focused analyses, this paper starts with an overview of the structural conditions that allowed such platforms to acquire their considerable regulatory power. Among these conditions, two elements stand out: the hidden -rather than non-deliberative- influence as well as its precise and comprehensive scope. While the hidden influence is what sets <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> apart from other, non-manipulatory tools of influence, it is the comprehensive scope that exposes the limits of ‘value-neutral’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-based frameworks. When we are manipulated into acquiring a certain trait, there is normally enough left of us that is free of manipulatory influence to anchor some after-the-fact endorsement or alienation test. As an alternative to ‘value-neutral’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-based analyses, this paper analyses the harm that stems from such systematic manipulation through a capability account of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Of all the capabilities that are essential to what von Humboldt would call ‘self-realisation’, the capacity to imagine oneself as a different person is critical. It is also the capability that is most endangered by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>’s drive to optimise our online (and offline) environment to maximise user engagement.</p>

<p>The purpose of the article is to consider the process of transformation of the image of a woman and the dominant family model in the main historical periods in the national female periodicals from the end of the 18th century to the present days. The authors note that the image of a woman in the gender media is changing due to the changes in the global and local agenda, in particular, due to the changes in the position of a woman in the family, the structure of a family, and decreasing of the number of family members. These transformations can also be explained by the change in the state’s requests for the promotion of a certain image, for example, the image of a patriotic woman during the Second World War and a mother woman in the post-war period. Over the course of many historical periods, rubrics devoted to the arrangement of everyday life, the relationship of the sexes, health and beauty, and motherhood remain the traditional rubrics of women’s publications. During more than two hundred years of publications, the image of a woman in them has gone through stages from primordial patriarchal models through a surge of individualization and independence to a moderate combination of the role of the homemaker and the installation of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> from men. The article also outlines the main trends in the development of modern women’s online publications, which, on the one hand, have inherited the theme and structure of traditional women’s magazines, and on the other, have the features of blogs. If certain characteristic images of a woman in the press gain or lose relevance, the changes in the family model in women’s media can be considered irreversible: there is no return to the image of a patriarchal multi-generational family. The study was based on the methods of historical review, thematic analysis and content analysis of publications of women’s magazines of various historical periods. Keywords: women’s periodicals, the history of women’s periodicals, the image of a woman in the media, media images, gender identity, family model, women’s <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online media</span></p>

<p>Digital trade depends on the accessibility of data through the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>, at the same time, several states have also introduced measures to govern the use of and access to data through the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. This measure includes data localisation measure. To enhance the digital business environment, ASEAN Member States in 2019 signed the ASEAN Agreement on E-Commerce (AAoE) containing a commitment to e-commerce liberalisation in the region. This research will analyse data localisation measure-related provisions found in AAoE. It addresses the following central question, whether data localisation measure-related provisions in ASEAN Agreement on E-Commerce can achieve balance between e-commerce liberalisation and the protection of societal interest in the ASEAN region. This research concludes that protection of important societal interests is attained by the AAoE. However, the structure of the AAoE in general is not in balance between the liberalisation and protection of important interest as such, but more to leaning towards the preservation of the state’s regulatory <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> on data flow.</p>

<p>In many countries, government agencies, business and employers’ associations, CEOs from big corporations, and even trade union leaders seem to be convinced that a fourth wave of industrial revolution is under way which will reconfigure the global production system and even societies at large. In the Anglo-Saxon context, this wave is often referred to as the ‘<span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> of things’, while in Germany and other European countries, where the digitalization of production and distribution is at the centre of the debate, this operates under the term ‘Industry 4.0’. These terms not only describe the digitalization of horizontal and vertical value chains of companies, but also formulate a vision of the future that promises new market and export opportunities as well as a new ecologically sustainable way of doing business. It is assumed that a ‘new spirit of capitalism’ will allow for a certain margin of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and non-hierarchical cooperation not only between firms and workers but also with the so-called ‘prosumers’, a term designed to catch the convergence of boundaries between consumers and producers, and referring to the unpaid – and usually unaware – work of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> user. Some pundits like Paul Mason go so far as to imagine that the fourth industrial revolution might provide not only a technologically inspired route out of fossil fuel dependence, but would more generally free us from capitalist imperatives. Others are more sceptical about the promises of digitalization, either pointing to various technological bottlenecks that stand in the way of a widespread use of digital infrastructure, or stressing the corporate crusade against data governance (just getting started), or questioning whether the digital economy can be placed at the service of ecological sustainability. This essay attempts to subject the digitalization hype, especially how far digitalization can be linked to societal goals in favour of workers, to a critical assessment.</p>

<p>Sub-Saharan Africa has been the scene of a sizeable wave of social and political protests in recent years. These protests have many aspects in common, while at the same time there is a certain historic continuity connecting them to previous protests, with which they also have much in common. What makes them new, however, is a hybrid nature that combines street protest and online action, making them similar to protests occurring in other parts of the world during the same period. Based on a literature review and field work on three countries, Senegal, Burkina Faso, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, this article addresses some of the main features of what some authors have called the “third wave of African protests.” The study points out how the digital environment is galvanizing a new process of popular opposition and enabling both greater <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for actors promoting the protests and greater interaction at the regional level. With the sociopolitical impact in the short and medium term still uncertain, the third wave of African protests is giving birth to a new political and democratic culture in the region as a whole.</p>

<p>Purpose Although a supportive workplace is increasingly considered important for employees’ performance, much of the evidence remains speculative, for example, it lacks offsetting mechanisms. This study addresses circumstances when perceived support helps and when it hurts work performance, depending on the mediating effects of job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, intrinsic motivation and job satisfaction under the boundary conditions of perceived helpfulness of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms and felt stress. Design/methodology/approach This study collected data using a questionnaire protocol that was adapted and refined from the original scales in existing studies. The sample consists of 900 employees from the public healthcare industry in Vietnam. To test the hypotheses, the partial least squares (PLS) technique was used. Findings This study finds that job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, intrinsic motivation and job satisfaction are important for the perceived support and work performance relationship in which perceived helpfulness of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms plays a critical confounding role. The findings also confirm that felt stress negatively moderates the relationship between job satisfaction and work performance, weakening the effect job satisfaction has on employee work performance. Originality/value This study specifies the boundary conditions under which work performance is mostly affected while enhancing the understanding of how to reinforce intrinsic motivation and job satisfaction. The findings offer organizational and human resource management (HRM) scholars and practitioners a closer look at perceived helpfulness of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms and support the suggestions that <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive workplaces are superior.</p>

<p>This paper investigated tertiary EFL students’ overall perception of the use of fully online learning during the Covid-19 pandemic. By administering a survey to 125 students of the English Language Education Program in a State Islamic University in West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia, using 26 items of a questionnaire with a five-point Likert scale, this study unravelled students’ responses in terms of three constructs including Perceived Usefulness (PU), Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) and Perceived Instructor Characteristics (PIC). The findings suggested that in terms of PU, even though the data mostly demonstrated neutral responses for most of the questionnaire items, the students tended to perceive online learning as to provide flexible time for their learning and foster their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>/independence and confidence. However, the students tended to perceive online learning as less facilitating for their understanding of subjects. In terms of PEOU, the responses reflected the students’ readiness to employ online learning as the data suggested that they possessed both the technology and the knowledge to use it. However, they tended to encounter problems when operating the technology, especially concerning the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> connection. On the other hand, these students perceived instructor characteristics as mostly positive. Therefore, online learning seemed to have not been designed to engage all students, yet seemed to be an inevitable option during the outbreak as the report from the interviews demonstrated that F2F classes were still preferred over online learning. Finally, these findings imply the need for redesigning online learning to better engage students in virtual classes.</p>

<p>This article seeks to reflect on the implications of literacy as a fundamental educational competence for citizens of the globalized world. In order to achieve this purpose, we characterize some of the paths on which this knowledge is disseminated and explain how it relates to written culture, educational processes and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies (ICT). In addition, it opens a space for reflection on the matter in Venezuela in recent years; supported by Bravo (2011) and Uzcátegui and Bravo (2017) reviews of official data. It is emphasized that literacy is decisively linked to the construction of the personal <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> necessary for lifelong learning and the consideration of reading and writing as social and cultural practices. In conclusion, it is considered that all entities and social actors should assume the commitment to literacy and the promotion of written culture, in its different formats and modalities. In this case, democratic governments’ responsibility of implementing cultural, educational, social and economic policies is underlined, for their implementation increases responsibility towards the people, and also, towards their living conditions.</p>

<p>This paper deals with the role of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>y (ICT) in higher education institutions in terms of capability enhancement of learners. In addition, the intents of this research paper is to focus towards online and distance education related with higher education institutions of Nepal. Particularly, the relation of ICT with capability enhancement, the relation of ICT and ODL mode of higher education learners, and the relation of ICT and capability with student learning has been explored in this paper. Theoretically, capability enhancement has been discussed in terms of connectivism and learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Moreover, the theories of capability enhancement as interpreted by Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum have also been used to discuss this issue. Besides contributing to quality human life, ICT is found to be helpful in promoting good behavior and attitudes, increasing their ability toward being, doing, and functioning. Integrating technology in education can help change people’s lives.

<p>This work proposes a novel concept for an intelligent and semi-autonomous human-<span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-physical system (HCPS) to operate future wind turbines in the context of Industry 5.0 technologies. The exponential increase in the complexity of next-generation wind turbines requires artificial intelligence (AI) to operate the machines efficiently and consistently. Evolving the current Industry 4.0 digital twin technology beyond a sole aid for the human decision-making process, the digital twin in the proposed system is used for highly effective training of the AI through machine learning. Human intelligence (HI) is elevated to a supervisory level, in which high-level decisions made through a human–machine interface break the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, when needed. This paper also identifies and elaborates key enabling technologies (KETs) that are essential for realizing the proposed HCPS.</p>

<p>Abstract Background There is a compelling need to prepare our societies and healthcare systems to deal with the oncoming wave of population ageing. The majority of older persons maintain a desire to be valued and useful members of society and of their social networks. Aims We sought to investigate the perception of usefulness among persons aged 65 years and over in four European countries. Methods We performed a cross-sectional survey with a representative sample of individuals aged 65 years or older from the population of retired persons (including recently retired persons and oldest-old individuals) from 4 European countries selected using quota sampling. In February 2016, an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> questionnaire was sent to all selected individuals. The characteristics used for the quota sampling method were sex, age, socio-professional category, region, city size, number of persons in household, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, marital status, place of residence, income and educational status. The questionnaire contained 57 questions. Sociodemographic characteristics were recorded. Responses were analysed with principal components analysis (PCA). Results A total of 4025 persons participated; 51% were males, and 70% were aged 65–75 years. PCA identified six classes of individuals, of which two classes (Classes 2 and 3) were characterized by more socially isolated individuals with little or no sense of usefulness, low self-esteem and a poor sense of well-being. These two classes accounted for almost 20% of the population. Younger and more autonomous classes reported a more salient sense of usefulness. Conclusions The loss of the sense of usefulness is associated with dissatisfaction with life and a loss of pleasure, and persons with profiles corresponding to Classes 2 and 3 should, therefore, be targeted for interventions aimed at restoring social links.</p>

<p>The development of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine raises fundamental ethical issues. As one example, AI systems in the field of mental health successfully detect signs of mental disorders, such as depression, by using data from <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. These AI depression detectors (AIDDs) identify users who are at risk of depression prior to any contact with the healthcare system. The article focuses on the ethical implications of AIDDs regarding affected users’ health-related <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Firstly, it presents the (ethical) discussion of AI in medicine and, specifically, in mental health. Secondly, two models of AIDDs using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> data and different usage scenarios are introduced. Thirdly, the concept of patient <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, according to Beauchamp and Childress, is critically discussed. Since this concept does not encompass the specific challenges linked with the digital context of AIDDs in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> sufficiently, the current analysis suggests, finally, an extended concept of health-related digital <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.</p>

<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3748098" class="uri">https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3748098</a><br>
<i> Theodore Christakis </i></p>
<p>This Study discusses extensively the concept of Digital Sovereignty. It presents the opportunities opened by the concept but also the risks and pitfalls. It provides a panorama of the major debates and developments related to digital/<span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> issues in Europe. Here is the Executive Summary of the Study:</p>
<p>“The Times They Are A-Changin”. When Jean-Claude Juncker, then President of the European Commission, proclaimed in 2018 that “The Hour of European Sovereignty” had come, half of Europe criticized him, recalls Paul Timmers. Today hardly a day goes by in Europe, without a politician talking about “digital sovereignty”.</p>
<p>From a purely normative point of view, the concept makes little sense. It can only further accentuate the classic confusion surrounding the use of the term “sovereignty”, which is one of the most equivocal terms in legal theory and which has been criticized by a famous scholar for often being nothing more than “a catchword, a substitute for thinking and precision”. Still, from a political point of view, “European digital sovereignty” is an extremely powerful concept, broad and ambiguous enough to encompass very different things and to become a “projection surface for a wide variety of political demands”.</p>
<p>This study analyses in a detailed way the two understandings of the term: sovereignty as regulatory power; and, sovereignty as strategic <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and the ability to act in the digital sphere without being restricted to an undesired extent by external dependencies. While doing so, this study presents a panorama of the most recent le-gislative proposals (such as the Data Governance Act) and the most important debates on digital issues currently taking place at the European level: 5G deployment and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security concerns; international data transfers and foreign governments’ access to data after SchremsII; cloud computing; the digital services tax; competition law; content moderation; artificial intelligence regulation; and so many others.</p>
<p>The first part of this study challenges the sometimes expressed idea that Europe is a somehow “powerless” entity, unable to regulate the digital sphere and big tech companies. Applying Anu Bradford’s concept of “The Brussels Effect”, this study shows that the EU is the most powerful global actor in the field of digital regulation. Far from being normatively irrelevant, Europe has become, through the “Brussels effect”, a “global regulatory hegemon unmatched by its geopolitical rivals”.</p>
<p>This does not of course mean that Europe can or needs to regulate everything. There are several limits to what Europe can and wishes to regulate. These are due to internal and external factors. Internally, regulatory action could be blocked by political disagreements among EU Member States; legal obstacles (starting with the national security exemption); or economic considerations - for instance the fear that overregulating AI could hinder innovation and affect competitiveness. Externally, situations of interdependence could render international cooperation necessary in order to avoid retaliation, to find constructive solutions and to resolve conflicts of laws and jurisdiction. This study presents some of the top priorities in the field of international cooperation and builds upon proposals to create “strategic partnerships” with like-minded stakeholders in order to defend certain democratic values and human rights in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>space.</p>
<p>The second part of this study focuses on digital sovereignty as strategic <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The EU quest for strategic <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the digital sphere is based on a series of legitimate concerns, including geopolitical considerations and a series of dependencies, the significance of which has been exacerbated by recent important developments such as the US-China “tech war” or the Covid-19 crisis. These concerns have led to initiatives which open opportunities for Europe. However, they also entail potential pitfalls. The EU and Member States should carefully study the risks and successfully navigate around them or, at least, take decisions in an informed way, after sufficiently weighing the potential negative impact of a specific measure.</p>
<p>Europe should first of all undertake to draw the fine line between restrictions based on legitimate reasons (such as compelling <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security or privacy/data protection considerations) and unjustified protectionist measures. Before engaging in anything resembling the latter, Europe should examine the risks posed by such measures.</p>
<p>Another area where much more study is necessary are the current calls for “data localisation” and the idea that “European data must be stored and processed in Europe”. Greater understanding of the stakes is necessary: what exactly does “data localisation” mean at a technical level? What are the exact reasons behind the calls to implement such policies in Europe? What are the potential adverse effects and the costs for European companies? What would be the consequences in terms of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security? And what could be the potential impact on human rights? Data localisation measures, initially promoted by countries like Russia, are now adopted by other countries. NGOs have indicated that this is “alarming” for the future of the free, open and global <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>. What would be the message sent to other countries if Europe embraces data localisation?</p>
<p>European calls in favor of data localisation are often motivated by genuine and legi-timate concerns, related to data protection, privacy considerations and the fear of foreign snooping into European personal and industrial data. Nevertheless, it is well known that data protection considerations can sometimes be misused as a vehicle to further domestic business interests and protectionism. The question then is how to distinguish between data protection and data protectionism. This paper advances a series of thoughts and a methodology in order to assess if data localisation is, in specific circumstances, an adequate way to deal with data protection risks. It considers that the critical test should be whether restrictions to transnational data flows are proportionate to the risks presented, taking into account the nature of the data and a series of other considerations. As a conclusion, data localisation could not be a ne-cessary, proportionate or adequate response to serve data protection in cases where the likelihood of foreign access to data is very limited and where other, more satisfactory and less disruptive, solutions exist.</p>
<p>In a more general way, this study raises the question of what model Europe wishes to promote. An increasing number of voices in Europe are calling for it to imitate certain Chinese policies. For years, Europe has been criticizing Chinese protectionism as well as the “Chinese model” of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>, a model based on firewalls, surveillance and control. How could Europe avoid policy inconsistency and contradiction if it enters into a “The Chinese do it, we will do it” approach?</p>
<p>The study concludes that Europe has important and hard choices to make in order to achieve strategic <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The “European digital sovereignty” debate is a useful way to inform policy-makers and citizens and to enable decision-making based not on emotions, but on careful risk-assessment and thorough analysis of the issues involved.</p>

<p>The Council of Europe has modernized its Convention 108 for the protection of individuals with regard to automatic processing of personal data: in 2018 it adopted Convention 108+. The modernised version of Convention 108 seeks to respond to the challenges posed, in terms of human rights, by the use of new <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies. This article presents a detailed analysis of this new international text. Convention 108+ contains important innovations: it proclaims the importance of protecting the right to informational <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and human dignity in the face of technological developments. It consolidates the proportionality requirement for data processing and strengthens the arsenal of rights of the data subjects. It reinforces the responsibility of those in charge of data processing as well as its transparency. It requires notification of security breaches. It strengthens the independence, powers and means of action of the supervisory authorities. It also strengthens the mechanism to ensure its effective implementation by entrusting the Committee set up by the Convention with the task of verifying compliance with the commitments made by Parties.</p>

<p>In the industrial system, the organization of labor had to be carried out exactly according to the regulations and instructions written by the designer of the work. In the postindustrial economy, the ideology of labor organization is changing. At the dawn of postindustrialization, such concepts as «decent work», «humanization of labor», «rotation of work», «development of human resources», «enrichment of labor», etc. are widely used. At the same time, the trends of «professionalization of labor» and its <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> began to appear. Step by step, the multi-disciplinary nature of labor grew, when from the post-operative Taylorist-Ford organization of labor began to move to a multi-operational, based on the combination of functions and professions. The emphasis is on creating holistic models of attractive decent work, reducing the distance between different categories of employees, primarily managers and workers. Unlike in the past, prevention, repair and reprogramming of equipment is assigned to the main staff. This indicates a flexible organization of not only production, but also labor. Thus, the employee is freed from the «dictates of machines» and bureaucratic instruction, and is given the freedom to choose decisions and actions while increasing responsibility and risk for the successful performance of work. It becomes the main link in the technological process. When creating new jobs, it is also necessary to take into account the fact that the employee entering the labor market is changing today. The quality of the labor force is improving: the employee’s educational level and competence are growing, and the process of development and training becomes continuous throughout life. The professional space of the employee is also developing, which is manifested in the emergence of new, sometimes hybrid professions related to receiving, transmitting, and processing information in its various forms and ensuring the sustainable development of the information environment. There is a transformation of the place and role of the employee in social production. These changes allow us to speak about the formation of a new type of employee, characterized by a high educational level, knowledge of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICT), having the skills to work with complex intellectual equipment, independent and creative thinking, activity and responsibility in their actions, high ability to self-organization, based on creativity in work, that is, the employee becomes creative. The new nature of work, manifests itself, on one side of individualization, it characterizes the weakening of relations of the employee with a certain social environment (workers become more mobile and less dependent on the firms in which they work), the conclusion of individual labour agreements, the personification of the system of motivation of personnel, and on the other – to increase the creative content of the work and turning it into a means of human self-realization. In this regard, the nature of employee management changes, since it becomes not only the object of management, but also its subject – an individual developing within a certain cultural tradition. Talent management, in contrast to HR processes, through which the operational management of personnel is carried out, focuses special attention on employees as the most important single asset that has a strategic focus. The article discusses the search for talented employees in the organization, highlights the characteristic features of modern approaches to managing them (employees), and in particular, the tools for this work, which are constantly being improved.</p>

<p>This article argues that sexual exploitation is the underlying harm that online luring offences should address, but that social anxieties about youth online sexuality have obscured this underlying harm. Through analyzing North American <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> safety materials and Canadian luring case law, the author finds that on the one hand risks of luring are generalized and on the other limited only to victims under the age of consent. The result is that very often older youth are made responsible for their own victimization, while younger ones are assumed to be victimized and hence denied avenues to sexual expression. By neglecting to analyze online interactions for the dynamics of exploitation, we do a disservice to older youths who are exploited while denying sexual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to youth under the age of consent.</p>

<p>It has been recommended that parents monitor their children’s <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use, including what sites they visit, what messages they receive, and what they post. In this paper, I argue that parents ought not follow this advice, because to do so would violate a child’s right to privacy over their on-line information exchanges. In defense of this claim, I argue that children have a right to privacy from their parents, because it respects their current capacities and fosters their future capacities for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and relationships.</p>
