Taking a qualitative approach, it explores the above as building blocks of new educational paradigms of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>; learner-centered education and co-creation of knowledge through discussion and collaboration, by exploring the various ways and reasons teachers use <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> as part of pedagogy in Pakistan. It suggests that, in order to understand fully the potential of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> as a pedagogical tool, being egalitarian, autonomous and emancipatory, there is a need to review the ways in which learning is viewed and evaluated.</p>

<p>The English education system offers meaningful examples of how some aspects of education reforms concerning school <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> develop and what their implications are. In a way it provides a test bench for many ideas which policy makers are trying to introduce in many other systems. It is therefore interesting to consider it, in order to gain a broader perspective from which to frame Italian school <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. This paper focuses on the complex scenario of English educational accountability, one which attracts the interest of researchers from all over the world and originates a continuous debate among practitioners, researchers and policy makers. The broad literature concerning English educational accountability makes available a variety of interpretations, reflections and points of view. The paper intends to consider this scenario mainly from the perspective of English headteachers. The objects of the analysis are the voices of headteachers and policy advisers, collected through interviews where they have been asked to report on their experiences and perceptions or, in the case of policy advisers, to put themselves in the headteachers’ shoes. It is argued that while policy makers from many countries look at the English accountability framework with interest, ready to borrow hints and tools from the orderly atmosphere of regulation it performs, English educational professionals experience strong contradictions and struggle with the hardness and the sharpness of the system.

<p>Research suggests that an increase in learner mobility across formal and informal jurisdictions is a positive response to an integrated global economy and workforce. To facilitate ebbs and flows of maintaining a mobile global workforce, the literature suggests that engineering education should promote methodology and learning mechanisms that personalize accountability of mobile learners’ content knowledge across jurisdictions. In addition, data from the literature shows that mobile or <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-learning is generating massive amounts of data which could inform engineering educators in their response to a mobile and constantly changing workforce. This paper reviews data from a pilot study of Technology-Enhanced Autonomous Learning Environment (TEALE). TEALE is a framework for mobile learning environments that afford accountability of personalized evidence-based content across learning jurisdictions. Prelimary data from this third pilot report suggests that TEALE promotes accountability of content knowledge across learning jurisdictions: both among formal disciplines in the academy, as well as between the academy, informal learning and workplace requirements. However, the data also suggests that seamless mobility across these academic and social jurisdictions involves issues far beyond technology. These issues, which include adjudicating relevance and value among academic cultures, incentives for motivation, authority and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> should be accounted for when using TEALE. Attention to these issues could prevent engineering educators from viewing potential opportunities for inter-jurisdictional collaborations as encroachments and avert the specter of unintended social-dramas.</p>

<p>ABSTRACT Cooperation in the management of Pagilaran tourism is an implementation of Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia Number 32 of 2004 regarding regional <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. This law requires local governments to organize and manage the potential that exists in the region. One of the potential tourism that Batang regency has is Pagilaran. Besides that, the purpose of such cooperation is to realize good governance in Batang. This study was conducted to describe the patterns of cooperation in managing Pagilaran between PT Pagilaran and the Department of Culture and Tourism in Batang Regency. It also explains about the difficulties in such cooperation. This study used qualitative research methods. Data triangulation technique is also used to obtain more accurate data validity. Sources of primary data obtained through interviews with relevant informants and secondary data obtained from documents, records, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>, and other sources which are related to this research. This study was conducted in Pagilaran Tourism Object. Results of this study illustrate a pattern of cooperation in managing Pagilaran. The patterns of cooperation not only done by the government and private sector but also community had. Community was given a role to managing Pagilaran. Community had opportunity to participate in managing Pagilaran which is helping the government to achieve a good governance in Batang Regency and in this case, community participate in public services in the tourism sector. Good cooperation indicators was taken from the efficiency and quality, organization dynamics, effectiveness, and also share risks and benefits. In this study, three of the four indicators which are the efficiency and quality, organizational dynamics, share risks and benefits have been implemented properly. The effectiveness indicator has not done well yet because the government has not implement the obligation yet to take care the facilities that have been agreed in advance. In addition, results also explain the difficulties that exist in this cooperation. Recommendation can be given for stakeholders to coordinate better so that the management of Pagilaran can evolve in the future. Also expected to every party to comply the obligations which have been agreed by both parties in advance.

<p>The purpose of this study was to identify the effects of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> filtering and restricted <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> access in a school system and its effects on teaching and learning. A total of 120 middle and high school teachers and support and administrative staff completed a questionnaire with 14 Likert-type items and one openended response question about their perceptions of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> filtering in their school. A chi-square test between middle and high school respondents revealed no significant differences. The majority (N=87) reported they accessed the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> on a daily basis. Nearly all agreed that technology support was available (N=118), but 117 respondents felt legitimate sites had been blocked. Although user agreements were in place, results indicated that some felt students were not always punished for downloading offensive material. Some admitted they themselves used techniques to get around the filter or block to complete their tasks. A majority of the respondents reported e-mail as a critical function. Most felt the restrictions imposed in this county school system were designed to be more of a ban on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> access. Teachers who used the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> to develop lesson plans must show how the web sites will be used to support the lesson, and get approval to access the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. Sites must be bookmarked for the students’ use, and teachers are responsible for students accessing only those pre-approved sites. Frequent comments regarded the “filtering” system as essentially a block that: hampered their duties, created an inconvenience, reduced student <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, lowered morale, and decreased the likelihood they would create lessons integrating</p>

<p>We draw on the geographical concepts of social space, territoriality, and distantiation to examine an apparent tension inherent in telework: i.e., using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies to work away from traditional workplaces can give employees a greater sense of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> while simultaneously placing new constraints on the way they conduct themselves in settings that were previously beyond the reach of managerial control. We draw on a longitudinal case study of a Belgian biopharmaceutical company to show how technical and professional teleworkers developed broadly similar strategies of spatiotemporal scaling to cope with this tension. We conclude by considering how these scaling strategies allowed employees to cope with the demands of ‘hybrid’ work that is conducted both at home and in traditional settings.</p>

An Interpretive Study from the Consumers’ Perspective Jyvaskyla: University of Jyvaskyla, 2010, 186 p.&nbsp;(Jyvaskyla Studies in Business and Economics ISSN 1457-1986; 97) ISBN 978-951-39-4077-5 (PDF), 978-951-39-4073-7 (nid.) Diss. Finnish summary The purpose of this interpretive study was to investigate how consumers participate in co-creation of value in advertising and what the dimensions of value were. The motivation arose from the growing centrality of consumers as “production partners”; the growing centrality of advertising value; the growth of experiential and visual consumption; and the growth of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. Advertising was conceived as experiential media products to be consumed. Empirical material consisted of consumer focus group discussions and interviews about advertising. The study involved 31 females. The empirical material was first categorized by qualitative content analysis following which it was analyzed using hermeneutical interpretation. The theoretical constructs of the consumer co-production model and aspects of consumer value provided the basis for interpretation. The consumers engaged in the co-production process in three different ways and experienced value in several ways. The first type was mixing, matching and blending in window-shopping, highlighting as value the females’ sense of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>: a feeling of independence and freedom of choice and a feeling of being up-to-date. Second, the goal-oriented journey generated: a feeling of empowerment; learning experiences; an increase in consumers’ cumulative product knowledge; and economic value. The third type was daydreaming and fantasizing that elicited feelings such as excitement, fun and pleasure as value. As the theoretical contribution a refined model of consumer co-production process in advertising is proposed. The model constitutes a new consumercentred, hierarchy-free model of advertising. Value is the consumer’s subjective experience based on the experience of co-creation itself and the consumer’s customized meanings of advertising. The practical implications were also proposed.</p>

<p>This study was designed in order to generate a priority list of dentistperceived important ethical issues in dental practice in Iran. A two-stage modified nominal group study was conducted. At first, the main ques tion of the study was presented to 24 dental specialists through direct interview (16) or e-mail (8, response rate was 75%). After analyzing the interview transcripts and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> responses, a list of issues was extracted. The list was presented to a nominal group of 10 dental specialists to prioritize ethical issues according to their frequency and ethical signifi cance. Each participant selected and ranked the five most important is sues and then, the sum of ranks for each issue was calculated. The first stage of the study resulted in a list of 26 ethical issues. After grouping and combining related items, the list was condensed into 18 issues. The nominal group session resulted in a prioritised list. The first six issues of the list included: performing procedures without adequate competency, not taking responsibility for one’s errors, over-treatment (or unnecessary treatment), inappropriate manners towards patients, unprofessional discussion of a colleague’s work, and unprincipled behaviors towards disadvantaged patients. Conclusions: The results suggest that the problems occurring in the therapeutic relationship between dentists and their patients are the major ethical issues of dentistry in Iran. Issues such as respecting patient’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, confidentiality, taking informed consent, third-party issues, and dentists’ duties toward society don’t seem to be considered of high priority by dentists in Iran as a developing country.</p>

<p>This research includes both a descriptive and an exploratory study of seventeen library and information science (LIS) education academic units or programs that have been involved in mergers or administrative realignments that have positioned them in new organizational homes between the years 1982-2001. These LIS schools have been subject to a process that has moved them, willingly or not, from a status of relative independence and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (and in many cases, cultural isolation), to that of partners in new alliances, or protected adoptees in new administrative and organizational homes. The authors wished to discover what took place, and learn of the conditions surrounding the merger or repositioning of the schools. We also wished to explore why these changes were implemented and to learn as much as possible about the outcomes of these developments. For the descriptive part of the study we relied on available documentation, often online, and telephone interviews with key participants in the mergers. Deans, directors, and senior faculty members were selected as a purposive sample for the exploratory, qualitative part of this study. A questionnaire consisting of twenty-three, mostly open-ended, questions was administered in telephone interviews. A follow-up brief questionnaire on specific outcomes was administered by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> to the participants in the study. What we learned about the rationales, responses to, and outcomes of these mergers and realignments is reported here. While such mergers and relocations have been successful so far as survival strategies, many of the anticipated benefits have yet to be realized.</p>

<p>The aim of this paper, is to give a overview of the real situation of the use of new technologies in teaching process of Italian language in the southern region of Albania. The development of information technologies is already influencing all spheres of human life. Nowadays, computers are used in learning and teaching foreign languages, as well as the education of other disciplines. The new technologies help students go into an active learning process. When it is thought in terms of the learner, it provides learning <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for the person. The learner can reach a linguistic competence in a shorter time by reaching several visual and auditory texts in foreign language, increasing his/her vocabulary knowledge, doing very productive grammar exercises in an interactively way, seeing the pronunciation of a word and the usage of it in a sentence, benefiting from translating programs, finding a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> friend to improve his/her communication ability, reaching the academic journals in the libraries ,reading and listening to the news in foreign language. In the Southern region of Albania this process has not been completely successful. DOI: 10.5901/mjss.2015.v6n6s2p93</p>

<p>The professional use and implementation of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> or <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> related applications are booming. Solutions like business internal communities promise to connect employees in a more flexible way than old-fashioned mailing lists or static network drives ever could. New solutions are perceived to support communication independent from time and space and in allow a more flexible way of communicating direct as well as indirect through the offer of different communication media (<span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>, voice over IP, mail, blog, etc.). But in contrast to remarkably good application scenarios, reality is not keeping up. Therefore more investigations of usage conditions and acceptance parameters are needed to find out which showstoppers interfere with a successful implementation. Due to the fact that acceptance by future users is one core condition for a successful implementation of software within operational structures and processes, this paper presents a study with focus on motivational issues to use business communities depending on diversity factors. In this study the focus is set on the diversity factors age, gender, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> expertise, achievement motivation, and perceived locus of control over technology (ploc). First results revealed that the classical user diversity variables age and gender do not influence the motives to use business communities. In contrast technology related diversity factors and achievement motivation revealed correlations with usage motives (r &gt; .3). The most important motives were the need for information and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Achievement motivation showed the strongest correlation with the need for social interaction (r = .51), indicating that highly motivated people can be motivated to use a SNS if it facilitates social interaction.</p>

<p>Recently, the way languages are learned has been greatly influenced by technology. Both learners and professors are exposed to the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> daily, so they can take advantage of it to teach and learn a foreign language. For this reason, it has become necessary to find ways to blend technology with language instruction.

Document management is regarded as an administrative practice allowing the Ministry to inculcate bureaucratic values and an ethos of serving the government in professor, making them renounce their administrative <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.Being engaged in bureaucratic re-arrangement of reality, Russian professors very soon embarked on paperwork, which boosted the document flow in universities. The large scale of this behavior model indicates that a new type of university culture was born. Bureaucratic management of universities in the Russian Empire was different from that in Western countries in that it aimed to make the document flow uniform with other public institutions and to develop uniform rules and formal language. As a result, professors gradually lost the opportunity to express their own opinions and to take initiative in communicating with the government. The authors emphasize the subordinate nature of activities performed by professors to satisfy relevant governmental demands, which suggested that professors assisted in opening new schools, controlled existing ones, eradicated prejudice, obtained primary data on imperial regions and resources (topographic, meteorological, ethnographic, and economic data), and disseminated Western scientific ideas and knowledge in regional culture. An analysis of document management in Russian universities of the first half of the 19th century has shown that they were part of the administrative structure at that time, which diminished their status significantly, as compared to Western universities.</p>

<p>The advent of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s has had dramatic influences on our daily lives and has rendered human beings ‘walking computers’. This holds important reflections in the realm of language learning, as well as in many other areas. This study aimed to explore the extent to which English Language Teaching (ELT) students utilise <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s for language learning purposes. To this end, a 25-item questionnaire was administered to 120 Grade Three and Four ELT students at Ondokuz Mayis University in Turkey. Following the questionnaire, a follow-up oral interview was conducted with 29 of the participants on a voluntary basis in order to further investigate their perceptions of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s. The statistical analysis of the participants’ responses to the items in the questionnaire clearly shows that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s are actively used for language learning purposes. In particular, their contribution to the development of vocabulary skills is frequently reported, which is also verified by the answers given during the interview. The analysis regarding the ‘gender’ and ‘length of the students’ possession of a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>’ variables does not yield any statistically significant effect on the degree to which students utilise <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s for language learning purposes. Given the fact that almost all students have a personal <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>, and use it very often, and considering the findings of this study, it is suggested that students be encouraged to utilise the invaluable language learning opportunities offered by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s when put to conscious use.

<p>The findings obtained from the study and research into the consequences of applying determined teaching styles has led to a growing interest in this area among the scientific community. The student-centered and constructivist learning environments which enable students to gain a significant understanding through their own efforts has grown in importance compared with the traditional learning environment based on the transfer of learning by teachers (Oguz, 2013). In the context of the constructivist approach, students create their own knowledge by actively participating in the learning process (Wang, 2011), and by giving importance to the learners’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. In these environments of interaction, the teacher becomes the learning facilitator, planning tasks and supporting responsibility for learning (Koc, 2006), providing students with options, helping them make their own decisions and solve problems for themselves. Consequently, this new focus provides students with opportunities to ask their own questions, and create their own learning concepts and strategies based on existing knowledge. The teacher has to accept students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and their enterprising spirit, and support them in this sense. In the context of this constructivist focus, one of the the main objectives of education is to promote students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (Ozturk, 2011).

<p>The Cloud presents enormous potential for users to have access to facilities such as vast data storage and infinite computing capacity. Yet the Cloud, taken from the perspective of the average user, does have a dark side. I agree with a number of writers and the concerns that they raise about privacy and personal <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and the Cloud. However, I wish to voice concern over another change. From the perspective of users, the Cloud might also reduce the range of user possibilities for robust interaction with the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>/Cloud in a manner which then prevents users from participating in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> as creators, collaborators, and sharers. The Cloud is “manageable” in a way the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> was not, and with users increasingly interacting with the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> with relatively less powerful devices than computers – <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s, tablets and the like – this ability for Cloud service providers to control or manage users is enhanced. We owe the vocabulary of “enclosure” to Hungarian-Canadian political economist Karl Polanyi. In his seminal work, The Great Transformation, Polanyi described the enclosure movement in England in which communally integrated and collective farming practices on common lands were suppressed by authorities of the state, forcefully and sometimes brutally, in order to privatize land resources and create the conditions for a market economy in both agriculture as well as other sectors. More recently, the term “enclosure” has been used effectively by American intellectual property scholars such as James Boyle to describe the manner in which intellectual property rules and the concurrent practices of IP rights holders (for copyright, often large corporate interests) in the age of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> were being used to restrict access to the public domain of ideas or the information commons.I argue that the Cloud, unless monitored and possibly directed, has the potential to go beyond undermining copyright and the public domain – Enclosure 2.0 – and to go beyond weakening privacy. This round, which I call “Enclosure 3.0”, has the potential to disempower <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> users and conversely empower a very small group of gatekeepers. Put bluntly, it has the potential to relegate <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> users to the status of digital sheep.By focusing on the entities that provide Cloud services, I argue that we might take steps to encourage or, if necessary, force private entities to keep the Cloud open and accessible in the long term. I also posit the desirability of a publicly-held Cloud to achieve this same end.</p>

<p>Introduction Several authors discuss the use of digital games as effective learning tools. Aguilera and Mendiz (2003) and Gee (2003) bring extensive discussions–and seminal works–on the topic, as Bransford et al.&nbsp;(2000) and Prensky (2001) have done before. The role of digital games in these processes is being explored in the scientific literature for some time already, as evidenced by the work of Squire (2002). All these authors discuss computer games, as possessors of an attractive addition with strong appeal to motivate children and adults, could amplify the power of exploration and imagination of students, providing moments of research, reflection and learning. Nowadays, more recent discussions bring to light the need for narrative games and applications directed to specific areas such as education in Health Sciences (Tashiro, 2009), Engineering (Mayo, 2007) and Computer Sciences (Mustaro, Silva, &amp; Silveira, 2008), for instance. Studies on contemporary culture, such as Johnson (2005), lead to the need to address further and specifically on the impact of the games in the education of a young of digital natives appropriating the term coined by Prensky (2001). Tapscott (1998) uses the nomenclature net generation to describe this generation, characterized by a high degree of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, intellectual openness, inclusion, technology, freedom of expression, curiosity, short-termism and especially confidence. Shaffer (2007) highlights the use of computer games as effective for children’s learning, while Prensky (2007) presents a broader approach, examining the impact of digital games in educational processes in general. Mustaro et al.&nbsp;(2008) argue that this scenario fully justifies even andragogical proposals focused on games, since it is possible to take advantage of nowadays’ technological culture to subsidize the construction of learning resources for both formal education and for situations of non-formal learning, for both digital natives and older students that are immersed into (or are strongly influenced by) a culture with a pervasive presence of technology. The main point behind all these works could be resumed as: the content carried both in formal and non-formal education present some structural problems. Some of them are listed below: * Content (usually in formal education) have a degree of abstraction that often prevents efficient learning when teaching strategies are used that put students under the condition of passive learners. * Some learning situations require students to spend huge mental efforts to memorize large amount of information and procedures. This situation occurs equally in formal and non-formal education, being more common in certain knowledge fields than others. * Presentation of the content in face-to-face education sometime lacks from real-world examples of application of such content. This is more usual in theoretical subjects than hands-on ones. * Even in practical learning situations, the subject being taught could carry a very high complexity, given the amount of variables involved in real-world experiences. Physics labs and field experiences are good examples of it. These are situations where real conditions do not help the learning process–the world could be not so real in these cases. In all these contexts, the application of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies (ICTs) in learning and teaching situations could allow new perspectives on various aspects ranging from content organization to a wide range of new opportunities promoted by the effective incorporation of technology into the entire teaching-learning process. At this point, the concept of Learning Objects (Wiley, 2000) is fundamental for the development of digital educational resources for use both in experimental and large-scale projects involving a massive number of students and disciplines in formal education. …</p>

<p>How children and young people understand and exercise their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, engagement and decision-making is fundamental to learning how to become active and engaged citizens, and to be socially included. Digital technologies are increasingly an integral part of children’s everyday lives and, therefore, valuable tools for supporting social inclusion. This paper discusses how digital technologies might positively support <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, engagement and decision-making through the lens of informed consent practices within social research. Current research practices are dominated by paper-based methods for obtaining informed consent which could be exclusionary for children and young people generally, and children with additional learning and support needs in particular. Digital technologies (laptops, PCs, tablet devices, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s) offer the potential to support accessibility and understanding of ideas and activities, as well as engagement with and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in decision-making and participation. This paper explores this potential as well as the challenges that researchers may face in this context.</p>

<p>In a case decided in 2008 (K.U. v. Finland - 2872/02), the European Court of Human Rights was confronted with the case of a boy whose photo had been posted on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and used for a sexual advertisement by a third person without knowledge or consent. The service provider denied the police access feeling itself bound to national rules of data protection. The ECHR, finally, held that under Art. 8 of the Convention, the right to privacy and family life, Finland was obliged to identify and sanction the wrongdoer. The decision refers to different problems that are regularly addressed under the heading of human dignity: sexual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and communicative privacy. The case will serve as an example for three conceptual conflicts in the notion of human dignity: The conflict between a sphere of protected privacy and the development of a social personality, the conflict between individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and the protection by public authorities, and the conflict between general normative demands and case specific criteria. While human dignity might be a useful theoretical concept to depict these conflicts it cannot provide criteria to solve them.</p>

<p>The aim of this study was to explore the effect of the Active Teen Leaders Avoiding Screen-time (ATLAS) intervention on psychological well-being in adolescent boys and to examine the potential mediating mechanisms that might explain this effect.ATLAS was evaluated using a cluster randomized controlled trial in 14 secondary schools located in low-income communities (N = 361 adolescent boys, mean age = 12.7 ± .5 years). The 20-week intervention was guided by self-determination theory and involved: professional development for teachers, provision of fitness equipment to schools, enhanced school sport sessions, researcher-led seminars, a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> application, and parental strategies for reducing screen time. Assessments were conducted at baseline and immediately post intervention (8 months). Psychological well-being was measured using the Flourishing Scale. Motivational regulations (intrinsic, identified, introjected, controlled, and amotivation) and basic psychological needs (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness) in school sport, muscular fitness, resistance training skill competency, and recreational screen time were examined as potential mediating mechanisms of the intervention effect.The intervention effect on well-being was small but statistically significant. Within a multiple mediator model, changes in <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> needs satisfaction, recreational screen time, and muscular fitness significantly mediated the effect of the intervention on psychological well-being.In addition to the physical health benefits, targeted physical activity programs for adolescent boys may have utility for mental health promotion through the mechanisms of increasing <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support and muscular fitness and reducing screen time.</p>

<p>AbstractThe goal of this paper is to analyze the association between <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies (ICT) and Advanced Manufacturing Technologies (AMT) and the adoption of a number of new work practices, such as job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, teamwork, job breadth, suggestion systems and involvement groups. Special attention is paid to examining whether the strength of the association with new work practices is the same for the two technologies. The data used in the empirical part of the research come from a survey conducted in 281 Spanish manufacturing plants. The results show that ICT use among production workers is only positively related to higher coverage of involvement groups. On the other hand, AMT use is positively associated with the incidence of self-managed teams, job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and suggestion systems. We have found differences between ICT and AMT in the strength of association with new work practices for self-managed teams and suggestion systems.</p>

<p>The use of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>y (ICT) especially the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> has been a common practice in education. However, research studies show that the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> has not been frequently used in the teaching of English as a foreign language (EFL) writing, especially in the Indonesian context. This study aimed to find out whether or not Indonesian EFL teachers are familiar with the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>-based techniques for the teaching of writing. In addition, it investigated their opinions on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>-based techniques of teaching of writing. This study involved 17 EFL teachers from various parts of the country who were asked about their experiences and opinions dealing with the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>-based teaching of writing. The results of the study showed that almost half of the teachers admitted that they have used <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> facilities for the teaching of writing. The other EFL teachers either have indirect involvement with the teaching of writing using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> application or have never used <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> applications at all. However, these teachers had intention to teach writing by applying <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>-based techniques for their future practices. The study also showed that Indonesian EFL teachers valued the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>-based teaching of writing as this practice benefits the students in terms of their writing quality and quantity, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, flexibility, as well as confidence. This implies that with the development of advanced ICT, there is a hope that students’ learning of writing could be improved well.</p>

<p>Adults with cognitive impairments lack the means to organise their daily life, plan their appointments, cope with fatigue, and manage their budget. They manifest interest in using new technologies to be part of society. Unfortunately, the applications offered on smart phones are often beyond their cognitive abilities. The goal of this study was to design a mobile cognitive assistant to enhance <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of people living with acquired traumatic brain injury. Participatory design methodologies guided this research by involving adults with cognitive impairments (CI) and their caregivers in the early stages of the design process. The population of the study is composed of four male adults who present cognitive impairments (three with head injury and one with stroke) and three caregivers. The first phase of this research was to design the Services Assistance Mobile and Intelligent (SAMI) application based on the needs expressed by the participants. During three focus groups, needs emerged concerning planning, health monitoring and money management and led to the implementation of assistive solutions on an Android <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>. During the second phase, the participants evaluated the mobile assistant SAMI at home for eight weeks. The results demonstrate that the participants were able to participate actively in the conception of SAMI and to use it successfully. People with CI showed a slight improvement in their life satisfaction. Due to the small number of participants, these promising results need to be confirmed by a larger-scale study.</p>

<p>This article reviews the elements that have facilitated greater communicative <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for significant contemporary social movements and organizations through new media. Taking as reference the historical diagnosis of Hans Magnus Enzensberger (1970) for an emancipatory use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, we analyse the process of emergence and development of a new information paradigm in the global activity of contemporary social movements. Finally, we offer a selection of common elements implemented by these movements for the promotion of open and emancipatory management of new media as a tool for social empowerment.</p>

<p>What has really happened in the Italian schools in the last few years? One of the main issues for the Italian school is to answer a series of seemingly simple questions: what is the improvement in the performance of students and teachers brought about by these reforms?

<p>The developpment of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things (IoT) concept revives Responsive Environments (RE) technologies.

In such approach, each appli-ance is a part of an autonomic system in order to control a physical environment. The underlying idea is that such systems must have self-x properties in order to adapt their behavior to external disturbances with a high-degree of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.</p>

However, actual ICT-based devices have limited functionality and impact, mainly limited to safety. What is an ideal operational framework to enhance this field to support outdoor and social activities? Methods Review of literature and cross-disciplinary expert discussion. Results A situation-aware ICT requires a flexible fine-tuning by stakeholders of system usability and complexity of function, and of user safety and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. It should operate by artificial intelligence/machine learning and should reflect harmonized stakeholder values, social context, and user residual cognitive functions. ICT services should be proposed at the prodromal stage of dementia and should be carefully validated within the life space of users in terms of quality of life, social activities, and costs. Discussion The operational framework has the potential to produce ICT and services with high clinical impact but requires substantial investment.</p>

<p>Since digital inequality among schoolchildren may exacerbate the existing rural-urban disparity, determining how to reduce rural-urban digital inequality among students remains an important policy issue. This study uses a unique and nationally representative dataset of 1953 elementary and junior high school students in Taiwan to examine the extent to which students’ characteristics, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of use, family background and resource inputs may be associated with the digital self-efficacy of schoolchildren. The Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition method was applied to further investigate the relative contributions the observed characteristics made to the rural-urban digital inequality of schoolchildren. The results show that the observed differences in factors associated with students’ digital self-efficacy account for 35% of rural-urban digital inequality. Furthermore, the number of computers in homes and schools, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> connectivity at home, mothers’ educational level, and the number of weekly computer classes provided by the school play a significant role with regard to the digital inequality between rural and urban students. We examine digital divide of students between rural and urban areas in Taiwan.The Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition method was utilized.Differences in observed characteristics account for 35% of the digital divide.To increase computer availability can reduce digital divide of students.</p>

<p>The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and the use of portable computers, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s and tablets have increased the importance of ‘new ways of work’. This work, which is place- and time-independent, can lead to more <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and greater flexibility for workers, but it also carries serious physical as well as psychosocial risks according to this working paper. The author of this report focuses on the hidden dangers of these new ways of working: techno-stress, techno-addiction, the blurring of boundaries between work and private life, burn-outs and overtiredness, safety risks and ergonomic problems. The paper analyses the European legislation on safe and healthy working conditions and how it can be applied to this new way of working. Last, but not least, it underlines the importance of this new societal issue for workers’ representatives.</p>

<p>The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities undeniably made a paradigm shift in the discourse and construction of ‘disability’. It seeks to recognise the inherent dignity, value and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of persons with disabilities as members of human society and their right to live in the world in an inclusive and participatory manner on an equal basis with others. The right to live in the world encompasses the right to live in the virtual world. This necessitates ensuring accessibility to the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. Whereas international human rights law recognises the state as directly responsible for ensuring accessibility, it is private corporations that effectively function as the gatekeepers of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. Unless corporations are proactively engaged, the virtual world cannot be made inclusive for persons with disabilities. The complexity of this issue requires looking beyond conventional forms of command-control anti-discrimination laws. This article explores a reflexive law approach to create a dialogic web between seemingly differentiated subsystems in society (with their own norms and values) in order to attain accessibility rights for persons with disabilities.</p>

My contention is that educational technology, more specifically using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>, can engender pedagogical action amongst learners and educators that resonates with democratic practices. In other words, using educational technology in science and teacher education can enhance learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and equality, so that critical, self-reflexive thinking and disruptive thought and action respectively can be cultivated through technology-assisted education.

<p>Two separate reports from the Dutch Health Council of Netherlands and Social and Cultural Planning Bureau draw our attention to the tension between certain factors specifically related to healthy aging, namely, vulnerability and independency/functioning independently. Though appearing contradictory, both concepts are very relevant in the elderly health care. Hence, the objective was to develop a conceptual and ethical analysis of vulnerability and independency. To achieve that, we conducted a conceptual analysis of more than 80 scientific and philosophical data collected from Pubmed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. Both concepts are mostly defined as separate compartments, thereby missing their intrinsic relationship. For an ethically well-argued analysis of care for the elderly, we present two new definitions in which the concept of dignity provides a fundamental basis of understanding both concepts, which are indeed two human conditions. Furthermore, we underline the implications of the new conceptualization for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and give some examples of humanly respectful empowerment strategies in the elderly care.</p>

<p>This article examines the 1996 World Intellectual Property Organization ‘<span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> treaties’ in Canada and Mexico to ascertain whether smaller countries can sustain policy <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> within international copyright treaties, and in response to lobbying by larger states. Treaty implementation in the two countries reflects domestic institutional, economic, and political actors and ideas. Even though Mexico and Canada are highly interdependent with the United States (the main proponent of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> treaties), they do have some influence in determining whether and how to implement the treaties. While the United States influences copyright reform in its neighbours, both countries’ policies continue to be shaped significantly by domestic factors.

<p>The author analyses the individual-empire relationship in the Soviet Union. The literary work Moscow–Pietushki, by Venedikt Yerofeyev, is treated as a superb instantiation of Soviet interaction rituals. The author rejects the Homo sovieticus model, the orthodox implementation of which leads to a recognition of individuals as puppets of the system. The analysis, inspired by Goffman’s and Collins’ findings, shows the social mechanisms which make possible the construction of a temporary world of transcendental delirium, located on the borderline of system reality. The constitution and duration of this anti-utopia system inside society reveal the relative <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of Soviet social actors: their conduct within this world is conditioned mainly by the availability of alcohol and the capability to play the ‘parlour game’. Such analysis, which surveys the universal logic of interaction rituals, facilitates a reasonable comparison of the practices of Soviet actors with the practices of actors located on the ‘friendly’ peripheries of the system, and with the relevancy systems and the actions of the CEE and the Western bourgeoisie. Sociologický casopis/Czech Sociological Review, 2002, Vol. 38, No.&nbsp;3: 297-309 Introductory Remarks The aim of this paper is to attempt to employ interaction theory in order to characterise and explain the individual–empire relationship. By ‘explanation’ I mean the disclosure of mechanisms that underlie the behaviour of social actors, and the construction and maintenance of interaction orders and social structures. Taking up a tentative attempt at such an explanation, I shall here be using the concrete example of the literary work Moscow–Pietushki, by Venedikt Yerofeyev [1994] (MP hereafter), which is situated in the historical realities of the period of the duration and transformations of the Soviet empire. I treat literary works as the products of the activities of social actors in relation to and within society. From my point of view they are social facts, just like other products and domains of social actors’ activities. In this sense, persistence in the thesis that literary descriptions are fictitious is heuristically fruitless. This thesis is as equally idle or fruitless as statements about the fictitiousness of expectations that a ‘full-blooded’ actor will have a date with a virtual <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-beauty or will discuss theological issues with a living St.&nbsp;Thomas Aquinas. I agree with Thomas J. Scheff [1997: 157ff] that, for example, the world of Shakespearean drama reveals, in an unmatched way, tensions and conflicts, and shame and 297 * I would like to express my gratitude to Alina Szulzycka for her help in improving the English style of this paper and to Henryk Domanski, Janusz Gockowski, Hanna Świda-Ziemba for their com-</p>

<p>Introduction Teams in organizations are specialized forms of work-groups which are characterized by strong interdependence, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and shared responsibilities (Guzzo &amp; Dickson 1996). Work teams are being increasingly used in a diverse range of organizations with positive results (Emery &amp; Barker 2007, Neuman &amp; Wright 1999). Researchers have identified cognitive, motivational, and behavioural processes and emergent states that are essential to the effective performance of teams (Kozlowski &amp; Ilgen 2006). Personalities of team members have been found to have considerable influence on group processes (Barrick et. al.&nbsp;1998, Frederick et. al.&nbsp;2005, Suzanne 2007). Similarly, self-efficacy beliefs have been found to be robust predictors of learning in training and performance in a wide range of situations (Gist 1987, Stajkovic &amp; Luthans 1998). Team member self-efficacy affects decision making in teams (Jeffery et. al 2003), group cohesion (Pillai &amp; Willaims 2004), and outcome expectancy (Stone &amp; Bailey 2007). However, most research on teams focus on industrial and commercial organizations in the developed nations. Following liberalization of the Indian economy, working in teams has become an imperative (Tata &amp; Prasad 2004). It has been argued that to survive in the competitive environment, among other changes, Indians should develop a team based work culture as it is an essential ingredient for higher levels of performance and innovation in organizations (Joshi 2001). Creating high-performing self-managed teams have been identified as a major behavioural training need to fulfil the requirements of Indian organizations in the next fifteen years (Sanghi 2003). However, Gupta (2002) has observed that due to ethnic plurality, importance of hierarchy, perceived in-group and out-group differences, Indians will resist working in teams. Poor teamwork has been identified as a major issue among the staff members in primary healthcare centres in South India (Nichter 2002). Teamwork is necessary for most development programs as it needs multiple skills to manage any development project ranging from healthcare, education or income generation projects. However, the all encompassing heterogeneity (Gupta 2002) and cultural factors (Kumar 2004) has been argued as a major threat to the self-managed work teams in Indian organizations. In a significant study of Indian managers Pearson and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Chat</span>terjee (2001) found that within a brief period, following the liberalization of Indian economy, managers in India have adopted values of teamwork and other necessary qualities needed to remain competitive in an open market; while subjugating societal qualities reinforced over hundreds of years. Similarly, studies in automobile sector have pointed out that, because of the desire to become world class manufacturers following deregulation in the early 90s, some Indian automobile manufacturers have transformed themselves into world-class organizations by creating a culture of teamwork (Dangayach &amp; Deshmukh 2001, Som 2006). In a case study of a government organization, it was found that excellent self-managed teams were created due to the role played by an extra-ordinary leader (Dwivedi 2006). Effective teamwork in an Indian manufacturing organization had significant impact in reducing wastage (Anand 1993). However, there are only few studies which have focused on teamwork in Indian organizations and all of them were on commercial organizations. In a developing country like India a large number of not-for-profit organizations are engaged in rural development projects for the amelioration of poverty and these organizations are largely funded on project basis by donor organizations (Mishra et. al.&nbsp;2005). People in these organizations work as members of rural development project teams (Duraisingam &amp; Dollard 2005). Interventions in the areas of livelihood, watershed development, health and sanitation, education, and other income generation projects in rural areas have largely been carried out by not-for-profit organizations with or without direct support of other government agencies. …</p>

<p>Networks of private actors develop and administer rules to regulate the conduct of their members. These private regimes enjoy varying degrees of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> from states and from international law. Some, such as the private norms related to lex mercatoria, the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, sports, and finance, have gained importance and density. These private legal networks can aid in the enforcement of state law but also can work independently of or even against it. This paper analyses the rationale of some private legal regimes and reveals their differences from state law. It shows that a significant number of actors are regulated by private legal norms that often ignore domestic legal systems. Some authors believe that private legal regimes have already eclipsed state law in importance. Also presented are thoughts on how legal theory might best approach private legal regimes.</p>

<p>The central role of evaluation, institutional assessment and quality assurance processes of schools and universities in education policy is object of discussion also considering the reform of the state. New Public Management theories and managerialist perspectives are considered some of the main sources of inspiration and legitimation in the dominant context of an audit education. Preliminary empirical data from external assessment of Portuguese primary and secondary schools are introduced and interpreted according to the main concepts and organizational representations of school found in external reports. Examining some of the central organizational images and meanings of school, school culture, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, goals, leadership and effectiveness included in the external reviews, the author stresses the importance of formal, rational and bureaucratic images of schools. Several new research questions are presented for further inquiry based on the hypothesis of what it is called by the author the process of hyperbureaucratization of educational organizations. Some of the main dimensions of the concept of bureaucracy as presented by Max Weber are revisited in close relation with neo-scientific approaches of quality assurance and taking in consideration the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies. Accordingly the author suggests that much more importance must be given to formal and rational models of interpreting educational organizations because assessment and quality assurance procedures are contributing to the formalization of schools and universities and to the intensification of their process of rationalization, i. e., to the emergence of an analytic image of schools as hyperbureaucracies.</p>

<p>The study used Explanatory Sequential Design (ESD) of Mixed-Methods to investigate college students’ and instructors’ perspectives of constructivist learning environment (CLE). Students, including graduates and undergraduates from a Midwestern university, rated their preference for personal relevance, collaboration, negotiation, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> as key learning experiences embodied in CLE. Results indicated that undergraduates were more likely than graduate students to prefer collaboration and negotiation experiences. Expanding on the results of students’ quantitative ratings, students’ and instructors’ perspectives of collaboration were explored. Eight participants (four students and four instructors) participated in one-on-one interview sessions. Themes that emerged from the qualitative analysis showed that the differences in students’ preference for collaboration related to students’ perceptions of unequal opportunities to collaborate, perceived benefits, and diverse backgrounds and orientations. In addition, conditions necessary for effective collaboration in the college environment were explored. Thematic analysis produced three themes: understanding collaboration process; monitoring, assessment, and evaluation system; and group composition. Implications for practice in the college classroom have been discussed.</p>

<p>This paper considers two emerging interdisciplinary, but related topics that are likely to create tipping points in advancing the engineering and science areas. Trusted <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> (TA) is a field of research that focuses on understanding and designing the interaction space between two entities each of which exhibits a level of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. These entities can be humans, machines, or a mix of the two. Cognitive <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span> Symbiosis (CoCyS) is a cloud that uses humans and machines for decision-making. In CoCyS, human-machine teams are viewed as a network with each node comprising humans (as computational machines) or computers. CoCyS focuses on the architecture and interface of a Trusted Autonomous System. This paper examines these two concepts and seeks to remove ambiguity by introducing formal definitions for these concepts. It then discusses open challenges for TA and CoCyS, that is, whether a team made of humans and machines can work in fluid, seamless harmony.</p>

<p>In India there are close to forty (40) Load Despatch Centres (control centres) for power system and electricity market operation. In order to assess capabilities of these Load Despatch Centres (LDCs), a nationwide survey was conducted with the help of a questionnaire. This paper draws inferences from the findings of the survey. It emphasizes that institutional capacity building of the LDCs in India is highly relevant in view of the ongoing reforms and restructuring, increasing vulnerabilities of the interconnected grid, rapid growth in the interconnection size, generation capacity addition, equipment/human failure, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> attacks, environmental threats and fast changing regulatory framework in India. The paper argues that the effective coordination amongst the system operators can come by establishing functional and financial <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the LDCs as well as by strengthening the capabilities of the human resource working in the LDC.</p>

<p>Societal risks of the new <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies including information privacy issues, have not yet been sufficiently recognized in the former socialist countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Newly introduced data protection legislation is an important step in this process, but in the highly politicized environment the problem often appears to be primarily a legal and political issue. The first Hungarian research on public opinion and mass communication in relation to information privacy shows a measurable desire for information <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and a considerable mistrust of information authorities, but nevertheless a genera! obedience in providing personal data. The stratum which exhibits a heightened data protection consciousness, higher sensitivity to privacy and increased distrust of computerized data processing comprises 16 per cent of the total sample. The research also shows that the desire for information privacy in the society is not adequately manifested in the press, nor in the awareness of political and professional circles. International cooperation is needed in research activity.</p>

Through Web 2.0 many tools could be used to plan strategies to motivate students for autonomous learning. This paper presents an analysis of such strategies applied to an industrial engineering course. It discusses an application in an Organizational Productive Arrangement (OPA) course using web tools to promote autonomous learning using an active strategy methodology. Two tools were used: a blog to promote interaction and a wiki to motivate research and collaboration. An information system was used to support an active strategy methodology. A survey of 40 students was conducted; the data is presented and discussed.</p>

<p>This article reports on a study of classroom environments in emerging <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> classrooms in British Columbia, Canada. The study involved an evaluation of the physical and psychosocial learning environments in these settings through a combination of case studies and questionnaires. This work focuses on the results obtained from the administration of a student questionnaire designed to measure aspects of the psychosocial learning environment in these settings and to relate these factors to students’ satisfaction with learning and to other physical aspects of the learning environment. Versions of the What Is Happening in This Classroom (WIHIC) instrument and Computerized Classroom Environment Checklist (CCEC) were administered to 358 high school students in 22 classrooms from six schools around the province. Analysis of classroom environment data revealed that student <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>/independence and task orientation are associated with students’ satisfaction with learning. Relating data to physical measures such as the workspace and visual environments demonstrated significant associations between the physical and psychosocial learning environment in technology-rich classrooms. Further qualitative data suggest that factors related to teaching styles, classroom design, and the learning environment interact to influence students’ satisfaction with learning.</p>

<p>The concept of identity is a multiform notion. Many authors have addressed it from Psychology to Sociology, Anthropology and Cultural Studies. Historically we find first an identification with the gods, the earth and blood. In Modernity, the individual is separated from its community and its original circumstances, developing a higher degree of individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. In our present mediatized societies, reality is not only mediated by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies, but also recreated through virtual technologies and thus deductible to equations, data and information. This process is reshaping our identities, which have suffered transformations imposed by the shock and the juxtaposition between the process of globalization and local cultures, distorting mechanisms of cultural identification, models, values and styles. As a conclusion, we present three ‘dimensions’ in which identity processes are built: referential, inter-referential and selfreferential. Finally, we ask ourselves what Nietzsche did 100 years ago: “is that which I am, that, for you, I am no longer? Is that what ‘I am’, that, for you, I am not? Is it that I have become another? Am I a stranger to myself?</p>

<p>The recent state-of-the-art networking technology has made the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> a vital medium to promote effective communication and education in language learning and teaching. Universities and schools have been reinforcing traditional classroom-based instructions with online learning management systems. Students can be benefited through the more frequent online interaction with the teacher for their independent learning outside the classroom. This paper explains what the multimedia-assisted language instruction means in English education in college classrooms and then examines how teachers can help students develop learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and classroom interaction using Moodle, an open source learning management system. Students of this study responded that English language materials provided through this multimedia-assisted instruction were very effective and that they felt doing class activities through online was very convenient because they could control their own learning according to their pace and situations. While sharing common interests and ideas about studying English or life events, they could study in interactive and collaborative ways. Students also answered that they could study voluntarily and more through these online learning activities.</p>

<p>Abstract Automatic monitoring of user-generated content on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s (SNSs) aims at detecting potential harm for adolescents by means of text and image mining techniques and subsequent actions by the providers (e.g.&nbsp;blocking users, legal action). Evidently, current research is primarily focused on its technological development. However, involving adolescents’ voices regarding the desirability of this monitoring is important; particularly because automatic monitoring might invade adolescents’ privacy and freedom, and consequently evoke reactance. In this study, fourteen focus groups were conducted with adolescents (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;66) between 12 and 18&nbsp;years old. The goal was to obtain insights into adolescents’ opinions on desirability and priorities for automatically detecting harmful content on SNSs. Opinions reflect the contention between a need for protection online versus the preservation of freedom. Most adolescents in this study are in favour of automatic monitoring for situations they perceive as uncontrollable or that they cannot solve themselves. Clear priorities for detection must be set in order to ensure the privacy and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of adolescents. Moreover, monitoring actions aiming at the prevention of harm are required.</p>

<p>Based on the existing research of cultural labour in the western academia, my research tends to explore the working life experiences of labour in Chinese <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> industries. The new forms of labour in the research are divided into three categories: professional labour, paid temporary labour, and free labour. On the one hand, the complex and ambivalent relationships between different categories of labourers are investigated; on the other hand, labourers’ working life experiences are illustrated via in-depth interviews.</p>
<p>Practically, this research focuses on workers in a large <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> company providing social networking services, Campus (anonymous). Workers in the research are explored via several aspects, such as working time and payment, working status, experience of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, as well as agency, referring to the negotiation and resistance between labour, company and the state. Theoretically, this research discusses the agency of labour which is largely ignored by the existing research, as well as seeks to contribute a bridge between the existing western research of cultural labour and Chinese new media labour.</p>

<p>This paper critiques the idea of full <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, as illustrated by Oxford University’s Robotcar. A fully autonomous driverless car relies on no external inputs, including GPS and solely learns from its environment using learning algorithms. These cars decide when they drive, learn from human drivers and bid for insurance in real time. Full <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is pitched as a good end in itself, fixing human inadequacies and creating safety and certainty by the elimination of human involvement. Using the ACTIVE ethics framework, an ethical response to the fully autonomous driverless cars is developed by addressing <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, community, transparency, identity, value and empathy. I suggest that the pursuit of full <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> does not recognise the essential importance of interdependencies between humans and machines. The removal of human involvement should require the driverless car to be more connected with its environment, drawing all the information it can from infrastructure, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and other road users. This requires a systemic view, which addresses systems and relationships, which recognises the place of driverless cars in a connected system, which is open to the study of complex relationships, both networked and hierarchical.</p>

<p>This article follows up the study of “moral structures” present in poetry as a cultural practice, inquiring about the role it plays in the self-understanding and self-determination of a political community that aspires to be democratic. It will proceed by arguing that Benjamin Barber’s republicanism deserves to be reconsidered in the light of the current trivialization and acceleration of politics by means of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies (ICT). A reinterpretation of the poetics present in Barber’s “political talk” might be interesting to the theory of deliberative democracy, specially in relation to the concept of “deliberation within” by Robert Goodin (2010) and the defense of the role emotions play in political life by Martha Nussbaum (2013). After stressing the importance of two endangered capabilities –attentive listening and slow reading–, the article concludes that poetry might be an emancipatory cultural practice within the enlightenment-romantic program that strives for mutually educating the reason, the sensibility, and the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of citizens.</p>

An emerging global information society serves to building global knowledge societies as source for further development.

The perspective of knowledge and ideals of rationality are both heavily influenced by a new contemporary scientific thinking, through tools, inherent of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and uncertainty. A new understanding of the world in terms of open dynamic heterogeneous uncertain systems is needed. Among the conclusions: classical rational reasoning is mainly aiming at effectiveness, not at uncertain knowledge processing, because of its temporality (mainly its ineffectiveness in dealing with future events); a bounded-rationality approach enables both, better economic models and better modelling, being based on trends in economic modelling as well as on agent-oriented software engineering.</p>

<p>Ever since the United States was reconstituted after the Civil War, a Confederate narrative of states’ rights has undermined the Reconstruction Amendments’ design for the protection of civil rights. The Confederate narrative’s diminishment of civil rights has been regularly challenged, but it stubbornly persists. Today the narrative survives in imprecise and unquestioning odes to state sovereignty. That appreciation of the doctrines of federalism and separation of powers should govern adjudication of the Constitution’s meaning is unarguable. That it should preclude national responsibility for the protection of human rights is, however, unacceptable. We analyze the relationship, over time, between assertions of civil rights and calls for the protection of local <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and control. This analysis reveals a troubling sequence: The Confederate narrative was shamefully intertwined with the defense of American <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>tel slavery. It survived profound challenges raised by post-Reconstruction civil rights claimants, and by mid-Twentieth century civil rights movements, and it reemerges regularly to pose questionable but unanswered challenges to calls for national protection of civil rights. Our close examination of the Confederate narrative’s jurisprudential effects exposes an urgent need to address the consequential but under-recognized tension between human and civil rights in the United States on the one hand and local <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> on the other.</p>

<p>Social computing and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>ies are changing the fundamental way people share information and communicate with each other. Social computing focuses on how users may have more <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to express their ideas and participate in social exchanges in various ways, one of which may be peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing. Given the greater risk of opportunistic behavior by malicious or criminal communities in P2P networks, it is crucial to understand the factors that affect individual’s use of P2P file sharing software. In this paper, we develop and empirically test a research model that includes trust beliefs and perceived risks as two major antecedent beliefs to the usage intention. Six trust antecedents are assessed including knowledge-based trust, cognitive trust, and both organizational and peer-network factors of institutional trust. Our preliminary results show general support for the model and offer some important implications for software vendors in P2P sharing industry and regulatory bodies.</p>

<p>Due to the progress in information technology, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-bullying is becoming one of the most common forms of interpersonal harm, especially among teenagers. The present study (N = 548) aimed to investigate the relation between perceived parenting style (in terms of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support and psychological control) and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-bullying in adolescence. Thereby, the study tested for the intervening role of adolescent need satisfaction (i.e., <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and relatedness), empathic concern towards others, and adolescents’ recognition of full humanness to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-bullying offenders and victims. Findings revealed both a direct and an indirect relation between parenting and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-bullying. More specifically, parental psychological control directly predicted <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-bullying, whereas parental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support related to less <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-bullying indirectly, as it was associated with the satisfaction of adolescents’ need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, which predicted more empathic concern towards others, which in turn differentially related to recognition of humanness to victims and bullies. The discussion focuses on the implications of the current findings.</p>

<p>Education is in a state of rapid change. The influx of new <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICTs) lead us to question: “How do we find the balance between continuity and discontinuity whilst critically renewing our educational traditions?” The paper develops a philosophical understanding that transcends utopian and dystopian claims that IT is either “becoming education” or “destroying the essence of education,” respectively. This philosophical perspective is developed around: (1) the question of student <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and the potential of its being undermined through ICT and (2) the processes through which students can potentially resist these threats. The paper develops and applies the philosophical understanding to the question of student <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. First, the paper emphasizes the importance of considering student <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the debates around the relationship of ICT and education. Second, the paper proposes a conceptual model of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, drawing upon some important ideas of Habermas and pragmatist thinking. Third, the paper identifies some systemic threats on educational processes arising from globalization and corporatization. Fourth, I outline the Habermasian response to these threats as a means to understand the nature of student response. Finally, drawing upon the conceptual ideas of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> presented, I consider five specific approaches to examine the question of the reform of MIS education.</p>

<p>Information is the symbol of the present age due to the significant development in accessing, processing, storage and transferring information. Information societies have been formed by the widespread utilization of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies in human social life and generally focus on the computer systems and information networks. Nowadays, various technologies of medical informatics comprise an important component of the management infrastructures of health care systems. Medical informatics is the development and assessment of specific methods and systems for acquisition, processing and analyzing patients’ data with the help of knowledge and information from scientific researches. Moreover, it intends to increase access, improve quality and decrease the costs of care through decreasing chronological and geographical limitations. On the other hand, ethics have been always considered as a basic component of these systems. The increasing development of digital technologies and their application in health information management provides numerous benefits; however, it encounters health care managers with new challenges in the information societies. These challenges may has been mainly caused by the conflicts among ethical principles by themselves or disregarding them in the field of medical informatics. Therefore, careful consideration of info ethics as well as beneficence, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, fidelity and justice is essential to overcome those conflicts in the information societies.</p>

It has been demonstrated that the accumulated educational lag had been eliminated actively during the two decades preceding the World War I by establishing new universities and professional educational institutions and by creating a series of private universities in addition to the system of governmental ones.In the dawn of capitalism, higher education was on the rise in Russia. There were ever more professors, and the number of students had increased almost ten times by that time. There also was an increase in social value of university graduates’ labor. The academic degree system was pretty close to that of Western Europe (Master and Doctor degrees), while requirements for candidates were much higher in Russia than abroad. As a professional group, university intelligentsia played a prominent role in social, economic, political, and cultural life of the pre-revolutionary Russia. In the dialogue with the government and the society, the university association defended the principles of university <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, which, at the time, was limited by bureaucracy and total control of the Ministry of National Education.The Soviet Union put an end to the progressive development of higher schools in Russia. The existing higher education system was fully destroyed, while university intelligentsia, as a social and professional group bearing educational culture and university traditions, was virtually obliterated in the epoch of revolutionary terror and political repressions.</p>

<p>This study examines teachers’ perceptions and comprehension of their school community support for change in implementing a new teaching approach in science and technology in the context of a reform initiative at the secondary level. It is part of a two-year research-intervention conducted with science teachers from a private school. Data was first collected through ethnographic notes and audio-recorded focus groups with 256 students. Although appreciated by students, the implementation provoked conflicts at the school community level. Building on the Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (<span style="background-color:lightgreen">CHAT</span>) and on the expansive learning cycle aiming at transforming an activity system, the actual study aims at deepening our understanding of the origins of contradictions at and between some of the poles of multileveled activity system that is object-oriented, mediated by artefacts (instruments), and comprises the community, rules and division of labor poles. Findings highlight the clash in the participant teachers’ values versus the community’s in implementing innovative teaching practice. Teachers report favoring nontraditional ways of teaching and giving more room to adolescents’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> while the stakeholders (school principal, parents) are often looking for traditional teaching practices and students’ school achievement. The results put into evidence the need to identify common grounds and to make sense of the new science teaching approach aiming at promoting students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, critical judgment, and school success levels.</p>

<p>Studies of stress and affiliation (3) suggest that workers who experience more stress in their jobs will exhibit greater affiliative behavior than workers who experience less stress. However, the former group of workers may show less desire for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and responsibility in their jobs, because under higher levels of stress greater job responsibility may be viewed more as a burden than a challenge (1). To test these hypotheses, 142 nursing staff of a hospital were administered Porter’s (2) perceived need satisfaction questionnaire followed by an intensive interview. Fourteen supervisors divided the total sample into three groups of nursing jobs, of low (n = 51). medium (n = 591, and high (n = 32) stress on the basis of severity of patients’ illness in the nursing units. The validity of this manipulation was ascertained by determining the perceived levels of stress in the three groups, using semantic differential type scales. The groups significantly differed from each other (F3.138 = 5.55, fi &lt; .05) with respea to perceived levels of job’scress. Analysis of variance of scores from the three groups representing satisfaction with six need categories (2) showed a significant interaction (F10.m = 4.84, p &lt; .05). Nurses belonging to the highly stressed group (dealing with terminal patients) showed a higher level of social need satisfaction than the group with low stress (t = 4.54, fi &lt; .05) working in outpatient clinics. Interview data suggested that higher social need satisfaction in the highly stressed group resulted from cohesive team work and greater social interaction among nursing staff on intensive care units. Their social relationships often went beyond the work place to parties and informal get-togethers where work problems and experiences were shared. Satisfaction wich <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and responsibility on the job showed similar trends. Highly stressed groups showed greater satisfaction wich their job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> than groups under low stress (t = 4.48, fi &lt; .05). Considering the fact that all three groups perceived similar levels of job responsibility and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in their jobs, the results suggest <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> the group under low stress wanted to have mote job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and responsibility than their jobs provided. The highly stressed group, on the other hand, did not want more <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> than was present in their jobs and therefore were more sltisfied with what they had. Interview data indicated that they preferred to share responsibility for decisions about patients with their peers or if possible defer these decisions to a higher authority. REFERENCES</p>

<p>The author presents a study of the relationship between expressive individualism and religiosity. Data were collected from participants in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> forums concerned with New Age and Christian religiosity (N=422). Through factor analysis, four dimensions of expressive individualism were identified: <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, setting oneself apart from others, personal development, and expression of emotions. The relationship between expressive individualism and religion was found to be ambivalent and negatively dominated by <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. After eliminating the effect of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, two patterns remained visible, both characterized by a positive connection to religiosity. Setting oneself apart from others is associated with more traditional and institutional religiosity, and personal development with a more private mode of religiosity. The explanation of this concealed longing for religion is sought in the pressure resulting from expressive individualism as a way of life.</p>

<p>In two influential articles setting forth his arguments against restrictions on free expression in the 1970s, Harvard philosopher T. M. Scanlon suggested and later rejected the notion that autonomous agency ought to be a primary constraint on most justifications used to restrict speech. The concept of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, he said, was notoriously vague and slippery as a basis for judging free-speech restrictions. Instead, Scanlon argued that free expression- and proposed restrictions on it- should be justified in terms of our various interests in speech as participants and as audience members. Reliance on <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> does not provide the justificatory force for a theory of free expression, he said. However, in his landmark 1998 book, What We Owe to Each Other, Scanlon relies heavily on autonomous agency as the foundation of several of his key claims. Scanlon’s claims that our interests to protect free expression conflict with his reliance on autonomous agency in What We Owe to Each Other and have important implications for efforts both to cultivate a healthy public sphere and protect the open architecture of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> within an increasingly global media culture.</p>

<p>Objective: This study aimed to describe the e-health activities of Project USP in Rondonia to promote health into the Amazonian Brazilian State Rondonia in different types of educational resources. Methods: Population of Monte Negro county was reached by the e-health promotion activities including tele-education for community health workers, teachers and local health professionals with the videoconferencing, CD-ROM development and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span>tutor technologies. The population reached was calculated by the reach of these professionals into their daily activities. Results: The e-health activities held by Project USP in Rondonia are reaching local stakeholders to expand the spread of health knowledge within a region with severe difficulties of access to information and health care. These stakeholders, mainly working locally in the educational and auxiliary health professions, are seizing their opportunity to provoke <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the population they work with, disseminating information among children in public schools and health care, possibly reaching more than 1,380 families. Conclusion: E-health activities showed to be important tool for health promotion to Amazonian communities. People living in regions with difficult access to many social needs, such as riverside communities, must be respected as citizens and thus their right to health must be ensured, which is provided in the Brazilian constitution, and it should be promoted through education, prevention and adequate health services.</p>

<p>Despite the advances made in artificial intelligence, software agents, and robotics, there is little we see today that we can truly call a fully autonomous system. We conjecture that the main inhibitor for advancing <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is lack of trust. Trusted <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is the scientific and engineering field to establish the foundations and ground work for developing trusted autonomous systems (robotics and software agents) that can be used in our daily life, and can be integrated with humans seamlessly, naturally, and efficiently. In this paper, we review this literature to reveal opportunities for researchers and practitioners to work on topics that can create a leap forward in advancing the field of trusted <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. We focus this paper on the trust component as the uniting technology between humans and machines. Our inquiry into this topic revolves around three subtopics: 1) reviewing and positioning the trust modeling literature for the purpose of trusted <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>; 2) reviewing a critical subset of sensor technologies that allow a machine to sense human states; and 3) distilling some critical questions for advancing the field of trusted <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The inquiry is augmented with conceptual models that we propose along the way by recompiling and reshaping the literature into forms that enable trusted autonomous systems to become a reality. This paper offers a vision for a Trusted Cyborg Swarm, an extension of our previous Cognitive <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span> Symbiosis concept, whereby humans and machines meld together in a harmonious, seamless, and coordinated manner.</p>

<p>Sports reporters depend on access to events and sources as much or more than any other news professional. Over the past few years, some sports organizations have attempted to restrict such access, as well as what reporters can publish via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. In the digital era, access and publishing <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, as institutionalized concepts, are evolving rapidly. Hypotheses tying access and work practices to reporters’ perceptions of the legitimacy they experience are developed and tested via a structural equation model, using responses to a survey of journalists in American intercollegiate athletics and observed dimensions of access and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to measure a latent variable of legitimacy. The model suggests that reporters have mixed views about whether they possess the legitimacy they need to do their jobs.</p>

<p>This manifesto argues that humanities-based ‘media studies’ never had a grip on new media and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> education: The term ‘media’ is well under way of becoming an empty signifier. In times of budget cuts, creative industries, and intellectual poverty, we have to push aside wishy-washy convergence approaches and go for specialized in-depth studies of networks and digital culture. It is time for new media to claim <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and resources in order to leave, finally, the institutional margins and catch up with society.</p>

<p>With over 1.7 billion individuals engaged in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, patients and consumers share more about their lives than ever before through wearable devices, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> applications, and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> outlets. This cornucopia of data offers significant opportunity for health researchers and clinicians to track and explore how digital presence contributes to patients’ health outcomes and use of health care resources. While patients readily share their information with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>ies, it is imperative that they maintain a sense of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> over who has access to such data. Recent data breaches of major insurance companies and retailers illustrate the challenges and vulnerabilities related to information safety and privacy. Many Web sites and mobile apps require users to agree to data policies, but how those data are mined, protected, used, and externally shared is frequently nontransparent, resulting in a climate of fear and distrust around all forums of digital information sharing. Although such skepticism is perhaps justified, it should not deter health researchers from attempting to collect and analyze these novel data for the purpose of designing unique health interventions. By clarifying intent around digital data acquisition, simplifying consent procedures, and affirming a commitment to privacy, the authors contend that health researchers can partner with patients to transform the boundaries of scientific inquiry.</p>

<p>Today’s mobile technology and mobile professions mean that people are nearly always either in, or connected to someone who is in motion. And yet, communities persist in the face of this constant motion. This is a qualitative study of a mobile labor group—taxi drivers in Chicago. Similar to Wallis’s (2011) conclusions, I found that access to and use of a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> does not automatically imbue taxi drivers with power and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> from forces that seem to be working against them. However, access to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s does help to shake up the hierarchy of control in the taxi industry. This study has also identified another type of community where the theory of polymedia (Madianou &amp; Miller, 2012) applies, that is, labor communities, and has shown that while choice of technology may offer some sense of power, access to mobile communication technology does not necessarily result in significant changes in power structures within and surrounding a community.</p>

<p>Abstract This was a methodological study that verified the validity and reliability by translating and modifying theKorean Version of LRM (leader rapport management) tool. This study verified the content validity, construct validity,concurrent validity and convergent validity on 200 nurses working in general hospitals. The LRM tool was analyzedusing a total of 3 factors (ego, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, association) and 12 items. The reliability of this tool (Cronbach’s α) was 0.83 to 0.86. The tool showed a high level of reliability and validity. The difference from preceding studies showedthat the LRM is a measurement tool that considers multi-dimensional aspects, and it can provide the basic material of report management methods in diverse aspects for clinical nurse managers.

<p>SNS is developing rapidly along with diffusion of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>. However as useage of SNS became excessive, SNS addiction became a social problem. Meanwhile the problem that users leavning SNS because of negative perceptions about SNS became issue. As both SNS addiction and continuance are important when using SNS, this study examines factors affecting <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> addiction and continuance. We derive three personal traits, which is <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, relatedness as variables that affect <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> addiction and continuance to use <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>. The authors` structural equation model using data, collected from 204 <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> user, showed that <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and competence significantly affected <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> addiction.

<p>The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> can be a tool to promote adolescent development.The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> promotes identity formation primarily as a tool to develop interests and expertise.The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> promotes <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> by providing a private space, and a way for adolescents to negotiate and test parental rules.Teens use the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> to form and maintain friendships, but less often to form romantic relationships. This study explored adolescents’ opinions about how <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use supports the achievement of their developmental tasks. Qualitative data were collected in focus groups interviews with 127 Italian <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> users (11-20) attending middle and high schools. Discussions were recorded, transcribed and analyzed using content analysis. Results showed that the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> plays important functions in identity formation, personal <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and relationships outside the family. It allows teens to develop their own interests, to identify with others and, at the same time, differentiate from others. The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> is also an arena in which adolescents develop and practice <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> can be a source of conflict with parents, because of parents’ concerns about <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use. However, the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> can also be a meeting ground with parents. Finally, participants indicated the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> is used to form close relationships with peers. Gender and age differences are discussed. Although the study is cross-sectional and relies only on adolescent report, findings illustrate how the conceptual framework of developmental goals may be helpful for understanding how the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> can affect adolescents’ lives.</p>

<p>Perception of the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and relatedness of the self may be influenced by one’s experiences and social expectations within a particular cultural setting. The present research examined the role of culture and the Autonomous-Related self-construal in predicting for different aspects of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social Networking Site</span>s (SNS) usage in three Asian countries, especially focusing on those aspects serving interpersonal goals. Participants in this cross-cultural study included 305 university students from Malaysia (n = 105), South Korea (n = 113), and China (n = 87). The study explored specific social and interpersonal behaviors on SNS, such as browsing the contacts’ profiles, checking for updates, and improving contact with SNS contacts, as well as the intensity of SNS use, hypothesizing that those with high intensity of use in the Asian context may be doing so to achieve the social goal of maintaining contact and keeping updated with friends. Two scales measuring activities on other users’ profiles and contact with friends’ profiles were developed and validated. As predicted, some cross-cultural differences were found. Koreans were more likely to use SNS to increase contact but tended to spend less time browsing contacts’ profiles than the Malaysians and Chinese. The intensity of SNS use differed between the countries as well, where Malaysians reported higher intensity than Koreans and Chinese. Consistent with study predictions, Koreans were found with the highest Autonomous-Related self-construal scores. The Autonomous-Related self-construal predicted SNS intensity. The findings suggest that cultural contexts, along with the way the self is construed in different cultures, may encourage different types of SNS usage. The authors discuss study implications and suggest future research directions.</p>

<p>This paper examines the key role of formal and informal social support in reducing digital inequalities by enabling the digital participation of older people. It is based primarily on research conducted on the Sustaining IT use by older people to promote <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and independence Sus-IT project in the UK over a four-year period working with over 1,000 older people using mixed research methods within a participative framework. It is further informed by other studies. The rich, multi-faceted evidence reveals on the one hand the extensive learning and support needs and requirements of older users of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies ICTs and, on the other, the dearth of reliable and ongoing support provision. ICT learning and support in the UK relies primarily on the goodwill of friends and family and on the availability of staff and volunteers in community venues, such as public libraries. Arrangements are often ad hoc and variable in quality and reliability. In a facilitated workshop, the learning and ICT support needs of older people and their preferred forms of provision were documented and deliberated. This generated a clear set of user requirements. To meet these requirements a proposition for community-based ICT support provision has been developed and refined. The paper concludes with consideration of this proposition which offers a powerful way to reduce the widespread digital inequalities among older people.</p>

<p>Prior research has established the phenomenon of the ‘Chilling Effect’ where people constrain the self they present online due to peer-to-peer surveillance on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social Network Site</span>s (SNS). However currently uninvestigated is the possibility that the threat of such surveillance on these sites might constrain the self presented offline in ‘reality’, known here as ‘the extended chilling effect’. The purpose of this study is to examine the existence of this ‘extended chilling effect’. Drawing on theories of self-awareness and self-presentation, the impact of surveillance in SNS is theorized to lead to an awareness of online audiences in offline domains, stimulating a self-comparison process that results in impression management. A mixed methods study of semi-structured interviews (n?=?28) and a 2?×?2 between-subjects experiment (n?=?80), provides support for offline impression management in order to avoid an undesired image being projected to online audiences. The novel finding that the chilling effect has extended highlights the potential dangers of online peer-to-peer surveillance for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and freedom of expression in our offline lives. Accounts provided of ‘chilled’ behavior offline due to online surveillance.Model tested for the process underlying the ‘chilling’ of behavior offline.Saliency of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> offline increases public self-awareness.Support provided for the ‘extended chilling’ effect of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social Network Site</span>s.</p>

<p>Organizational structure of colleges and universities decides the commanding system,information <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and interpersonal relations.It affects the efficiency of the structure.The long-term planned economy causes a lot of restrictions on the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of colleges and universities,which leads to a stiff internal organizational structure and shortage of flexibility and creativity.All these influence the teachers’ innovation ability.Therefore,colleges and universities need to set up a simplified internal organizational structure which contains the fewest administrative procedures to help teachers become more innovative.</p>

<p>Project-based learning is a widely used pedagogical strategy in engineering education shown to be effective in fostering problem-solving, design, and teamwork skills. There are distinct benefits to be gained from giving students <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in determining the nature and scope of the projects that they wish to undertake, but a lack of expert guidance and of a clear direction at the outset can result in confusion, frustration, and unfulfilled goals. Moreover, engineering schools face the imperative of providing students with opportunities to engage with industry during their courses, which can be difficult to accomplish due to logistical and time constraints. This paper reports on a case study in which undergraduate students of electrical, computer, me<span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>ronics, and telecommunications engineering interacted with representatives from industry to obtain feedback at the inception phase of their design projects. Students pitched their ideas to the industry guests at a virtual “trade fair” held within a hybrid video conferencing and three-dimensional (3-D) virtual world environment, in preparation for the assessable pitches that they had to deliver on campus to a faculty audience. Survey and assessment results attest to the participants’ satisfaction as well as to the effectiveness of the approach in improving student self-efficacy and performance. The paper concludes with recommendations for engineering educators looking to implement similar initiatives and a brief outline of the authors’ plans for the future.</p>

<p>While the rapidly developing network technology provides the mankind with happiness and many opportunities, it has brought about an impact and challenges on social ethics. There exist a lot of ethical bewilderment and moral conflicts in dealing with the relationships between <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>space and real society, information sharing and intellectual property protection, personal privacy and social supervision, communication freedom and moral responsibility, globalization and national characteristics. It is necessary to strengthen researches into network moral construction, in order to help the people make correct behavior choice.

<p>With the development and popularity of computer network technology,the right protection of the citizen’s <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> or intangible private space has become more and more prominent.On the other hand,the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of private space as provided in the prevailing constitution refers only to the tangible assets — houses,leaving out the intangible private space — network.The citizen’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of private space ought to be explicitly stipulated in the constitution,which should involve both tangible spaces like residence or communication and intangible space like network.To make consummate the citizen’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of private space,we should enlarge the range of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in Constitution,establish the open and progressive legislation pattern for basic rights,and make definite the legal contents of private space <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.</p>

<p>In the context of de-administrative reform,it has important realistic significance to perfect the legal system of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in colleges and universities.China’s Higher Education Act is the basic legal form to guarantee the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in colleges and universities,and makes main stipulation about it,but related legislation still remains some defects.In order to protect the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in colleges and universities and implement it effectively,and then to promote the de-administrative reform in colleges and universities,Higher Education Act should establish the ideal of law system to control the authority of government and protect the rights of colleges and universities,clearly define the legal nature of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in colleges and universities,perfect the system of protecting and restraining the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>,and improve the system of controlling the government’s power of intervention and then construct the system of ensuring <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>tion to participate in running school.</p>
