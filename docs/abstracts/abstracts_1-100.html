<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="doc-1-cyberspace-self-governance-a-skeptical-view-from-democratic-theory">Doc 1 : <b> Cyberspace Self-Governance: A Skeptical View from Democratic Theory </b></h2>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.175828" class="uri">https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.175828</a><br>
<i> Neil Weinstock Netanel </i></p>
<p>The idea that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>space should be presumptively self-governing has resounded in thoughtful scholarship. It has also precipitated the recent, dramatic withdrawal of the United States government from significant portions of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> administration and regulation. This Article critiques a central prong of the argument for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>space self-governance: the claim that a self-governing <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>space would more fully realize liberal democratic ideals than does nation-state representative democracy. That <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>ian claim, in turn, has two parallel components: first, that the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> creates possibilities for bottom-up private ordering that are a superior form of liberal democracy, and second, that a truly liberal nation-state must grant considerable <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>space communities. These claims of liberal perfectionism and community <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> pose an intriguing challenge to traditional democratic theory. But I believe that they ultimately fail. I argue, indeed, that an untrammeled <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>space would prove inimical to the ideals of liberal democracy. It would free majorities to trample upon minorities and would serve as a breeding ground for invidious status discrimination, narrow casting and mainstreaming content selection, systematic invasions of privacy, and gross inequalities in the distribution of basic requisites for citizenship in the information age. Accordingly, I argue, that selective state regulation of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>space is warranted to protect and promote liberal ideals. I maintain as well that in the absence of regulation by a democratic state, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>ians would be forced to try to invent a quasi-state institution to legislate and enforce meta-norms governing critical aspects of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>space organization and operation. Even if <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>ians were successfully to establish such an institution, it would, at best, suffer from much the same democratic deficit as, according to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>ians, characterizes nation-state representative democracy.</p>

<p>The maxim that â€˜information is powerâ€™ is relevant now more than ever. Until recently, most information was scattered, disorganized and awkward to find then acquire. Google was one of the first to realize how digital technology changed that by encoding information as 1s and 0s. Googleâ€™s corporate mission is to organise the worldâ€™s information and make it universally accessible and useful. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>â€™s mission is to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.Â&nbsp; The relations between Google, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> and other social spheres on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> emphasize their â€˜relative <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.â€™ The intuition behind the â€˜relative <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>â€™ formula is that they are neither wholly independent of, nor entirely reducible to, political, legal, economic and other social processes. This article examines the relation between Google, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> and other social spheres. The theory examined will be Niklas Luhmannâ€™s theory of â€˜autopoiesis.â€™ This article presents autopoietic theory with particular attention to the way in which Luhmann reformulates the â€˜relative <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>â€™ problem. Throughout, the article focuses on the connections between autopoietic theory and issues of Google, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> and contemporary legal theory.</p>

<p>This paper analyses the effects of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> on the organisations and the markets in the tourism industry. It enlightens its deepening impact on incumbent organisations and markets from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 though the analysis of the dynamics of the long tail, i.e., of the distribution of activities in tourism. Innovation is gone from exploitation to exploration of the long tail, towards the emergence of non-profit or for-profit knowledge intensive service suppliers (KISS) allowing ‘prosumers’ to find solutions to run themselves their activities, through users generated resources. The growing <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the tail from the head of distribution in the tourism industry emerges with the development of a platform economy, i.e., of global innovative market places inside the long tail itself.</p>

<p>South Asia has vast unmet health needs especially in rural areas. Community-based medical education can partly address these needs and can serve to introduce students to a number of community health problems. Climate change has the potential to produce major challenges for health and food security in South Asia. Medical students should be taught about climate change and methods to tackle its impact on health. The pharmaceutical industry in South Asia aggressively promotes their products. Disease mongering is becoming more common in South Asia. Educational initiatives to sensitize students regarding promotion are common in developed countries. In Nepal, an educational initiative critically looks at the industry’s promotional tactics. Similar initiatives are required in other medical schools. The nature of the doctor-patient relationship is changing. An increasing demand for patient <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and for their involvement in therapeutic decisions is seen. Access to the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> sources of health information is increasing. Medical schools should address these issues as well. Medical Humanities modules and courses in communication skills are required. Research can play an important role in alleviating the health problems of South Asia. Students should be taught the basics of scientific research and student research should be strongly encouraged.</p>

<p>Millions of people contribute to online content daily, allowing them to share their ideas and influence public conversations. Some have attached much enthusiasm and hope to such activities as they may result in a variety of benefits, including cultural empowerment, engagement with the political process, and collective knowledge production. While these considerations cast the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> as a potentially equalizing platform, research has shown that certain groups of people are more likely to participate in such online activities than others. All existing research on this topic has relied on cross-sectional data, making it impossible to make causal arguments about what results in more or less online engagement. That is, while research has found, for example, that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> skills are related to online participation, the cross-sectional nature of the data makes it difficult for scholars to disentangle the causal effect between the two variables, that is, whether higher skills result in more participation or whether more participation leads to higher skills, or both. In this paper, we draw on a unique panel survey data set that includes data about the same 547 young adults from 2009 and 2012 to address these questions. We consider how demographic factors, socioeconomic status as well as various <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> experiences such as veteran status, frequency of use, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of use, self-efficacy and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> skills may influence people’s participation online, from editing Wikipedia to taking part in online forum discussions, posting reviews and voting on others’ content. We find that far from being universal, only a small portion of respondents have ever participated in several of these types of online activities, and some have never engaged in any of them. Despite the study’s focus on young adults who have grown up with digital media, not only is participation not universal, there are systematic differences in the types of people who are more or less likely to participate. We show that young adults with higher levels of Web-use skills are more likely to engage in various online production activities than their less-skilled counterparts. In particular, those from more privileged backgrounds, i.e., whose parents have higher levels of education, are more likely to contribute their voices to online conversations. This paper makes a special contribution to the growing literature on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> skills by examining how three different measures of this concept relate to online engagement. We look at a universal <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> skills measure, we include a measure of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> self-efficacy, and we test the effect of a more nuanced measure of Web-use skills. We find that self-efficacy and skill have independent effects on the outcome of online engagement suggesting that research on people’s online know-how should not collapse these conceptually different variables. The paper ends with the policy implications of the findings for achieving a universally empowered <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> citizenry. Findings suggest that simply having grown up with digital media does not result in either universal know-how about the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> nor universal online engagement suggesting that interventions are important to make sure that people from all backgrounds have the necessary skills to take advantage of all that the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> has to offer.</p>

<p>The use of mobile wireless technologies brings associated paradoxes already identified in the literature. Thus, this research uses quantitative analysis to determine the perception of presence and intensity level of fourteen technological paradoxes related to the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> by professionals in Brazil. Besides, this study identifies the variables that impact the perception of each paradox associated with the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> by professionals. Data analysis shows that the paradox <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> vs.&nbsp;addiction is perceived by more than 85% of those who responded to the survey. The study also results in a paradoxes ranking regarding the strength of the paradoxes. This ranking has the following paradoxes in the top positions: <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> vs.&nbsp;addiction, engagement vs.&nbsp;disengagement, and freedom vs.&nbsp;enslavement, respectively. Finally, an ordinal logistic regression is run, leading to the conclusion that only two of the fourteen paradoxes are influenced by some of the independent variables of the model.</p>

<p>Over the past two decades, vehicular engineering and design have made significant developments in driving assistance systems. The focus is gradually shifting from partial to full <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> with the possibility of self-driving cars on the author’s roads becoming an absolute reality. This is an important transformation, as vehicular controls start to critically rely on a range of sensing and communication systems. Such dependencies also make vehicular platforms vulnerable to a multitude of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> security threats, which have the potential to disrupt and damage vehicles alongside endangering driver and passenger safety, with only nascent security controls (derived, in the main, from safety techniques) to prevent or mitigate these dangers. This article critically examines some such threats and reviews the state-of-the-art of controls and countermeasures to counter such threats.</p>

<p>Abstract A worldwide trend in advanced manufacturing countries is defining Industrie 4.0, Industrial <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and Factories of the Future as a new wave that can revolutionize the production and its associated services. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span>-Physical Systems (CPS) are central to this vision and are entitled to be part of smart machines, storage systems and production facilities able to exchange information with <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and intelligence. Such systems should be able to decide and trigger actions, and control each other independently and for such reason it is required the use of Knowledge based and intelligent information approaches. In this paper we present our perspective on how to support Industrie 4.0 with Knowledge based and intelligent systems. We focus in the conceptual model, architecture and necessary elements we believe are required for a real world implementation. We base our conceptualization in the experiences gathered during the participation in different ongoing research projects where the presented architecture is being implemented.</p>

Further, it is doubtful whether an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> doctor will accept responsibility.

<p>In this article we present the case of the Evenki people, Siberian hunter-gatherers that share some traits of egalitarianism with other hunter-gathering people of the world. Using the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netic approach, proposed by Gregory Bateson in social anthropology, we describe the circular logic of interaction between genders and study the strategies that Evenki use to solve contradictions between personal <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> ( manakan ) and dependencies associated with inter-gender relationships. The scope of our interest covers such situations as flirting, conjugal unit establishment, promotion of business contacts with strangers ( andaki relationships), everyday violence and aggression, as well as ecstatic states. The presented analysis of the episodes of interaction in everyday life shows that Evenki social organization is based on a situational approach to the distinction of genders. The research is based on several fieldworks conducted in the Baikal region (Russia), but the core materials relate to a two-month stay with one Evenki community in spring 2006.</p>

<p>This paper examines the potential for theory to adapt to changing contexts of health in the western world. The commoditization of health and the ideology of biomedicine affects social life in creating dependency, social control, and vast inequalities. At the same time, increased access and diversity of consumer health knowledge as evidenced by the use of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and the sharp rise in alternative medicine point to a different dialectic between doctor and patient and the potential for transforming diagnostic, treatment, and economic components of health care. Recent trends suggest increasing patient <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and the possibility of a re-emergence of medical pluralism. New theoretical directions should be considered by social scientists in order to more fully understand these changes.</p>

<p>Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) call for integrating knowledge and practice in learning experiences in K-12 science education. PlantingScience (PS), an ideal curriculum for use as an NGSS model, is a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">computer-mediated</span> collaborative learning environment intertwining scientific inquiry, classroom instruction, and online mentoring from scientists. With implementation in hundreds of classrooms across the United States, science teachers have noted PS as successful in motivating their students to engage in classroom inquiry investigations. To investigate the role of the online scientist-mentors in motivating students in the PS learning environment, we used self-determination theory (SDT) to guide a multiple case study of 10 student inquiry teams engaged in PS in a rural public school in a large Southwestern U.S. state. We used online dialogues between scientist-mentors and their assigned student inquiry teams to answer research questions about the motivational support provided by scientist-mentors and the association between this support and students’ engagement in scientific inquiry. Analyses revealed a general relationship between scientist-mentor motivational support and student inquiry engagement. Differences were observed in the specific ways in which scientists supported <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness. Student inquiry engagement corresponded to high support in relatedness, whereas correspondence with <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> support was low.</p>

<p>The monitoring of children in time and space, from a distance via the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s, is a phenomenon never experienced in previous generations. Indeed, as frequently recited, the increased protection of children by monitoring them is a central characteristic of modern childhood (Rasmussen, 2003; Qvortrup, 1993) and the effects of this are not yet know. Equally our understanding of how children in middle childhood (8 – 12 years) negotiate and or resist this monitoring is unclear. This paper seeks to add to the emerging body of knowledge on the strategies employed by children in middle childhood to negotiate and resist the monitoring and surveillance of their physical selves in time and space using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s. I suggest that the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> can be transformed by children into a highly efficient device to enable them to both negotiate and resist surveillance thus increasing their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and independent mobility. Children are not passive recipients of parental surveillance and power, rather they are increasingly playing an active role in negotiation with parents and actively resist monitoring of their everyday lives to both make meaning anew and produce culture.</p>

<p>Sociological accounts of the literary field emphasise the ways it is institutionally shaped and how actors within it make claims to cultural authority. These accounts include consideration of reviewing as a social or institutional practice and the role of literary prizes in the production and management of esteem. Much of this research draws on the work of Pierre Bourdieu as an inspiration, particularly around notions of cultural capital, disinterestedness and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Recent research into such phenomena as Oprah’s Book Club in the US has demonstrated the complexities and ambiguities of cultural authority in the light of mass forms of participation and access. This paper uses the recent phenomenon of The Big Read – a television and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> based search for ‘the nation’s favourite books’ broadcast in 2003 – to examine persistent and emerging forms of cultural authority in the light of these debates. By exploring the processes of book selection, the type of books selected and drawing on a textual analysis of the television programmes covering ‘the top 21’ favourite books, the paper examines the different ways in which questions of value in the literary field were addressed and negotiated. The paper concludes by suggesting the need for a modification of the Bourdieusian perspective on cultural authority in understanding the contemporary literary field.</p>

<p>The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> has the potential to provide language learners with vast resources of authentic written, audio, and video materials to supplement lessons. Educators can find a wide assortment of materials for learners to study in class or after class for independent learning and to encourage learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. More recently, however, the immense popularity of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking website</span>s has created new opportunities for language learners to interact in authentic ways that were previously difficult to achieve. Advances in technology mean that today, learners of a language can easily interact with their peers in meaningful practice that helps foster language acquisition and motivation. That is, tasks that make use of Web 2.0 interactivity can significantly raise students’ potential to generate meaningful output and stimulate their interest in language learning.</p>

<p>The unilateral and unqualified nature of the right to abandon (at least as it is usually described) appears to make it a robust example of the law’s concern to safeguard the individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> interests that many contemporary commentators have identified as lying at the heart of the concept of private ownership. The doctrine suppos edly empowers owners of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>tels freely and unilaterally to abandon them by manifesting the clear intent to do so, typically by renouncing possession of the object in a way that communicates the intent to forgo any future claim to it. A complication immediately arises, however, due to the common law’s traditional prohibition of the abandonment of land. But the problem goes even deeper. Viewed through the lens of land, the (prospective) right to abandon virtu ally any form of tangible property, even <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>tels, is an illusion. This is because the legal prohibition of abandoning land dramatically qualifies the unilateral right to abandon <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>tels to the point of in significance. The common law’s treatment of land is not an anomalous restriction within a legal regime that otherwise empow ers owners to freely abandon their property. Instead, the inability to abandon land forms the foundation of a system that, among other things, helps regulate and direct the disposition of unwanted <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> tels by requiring those seeking to sever their bonds of ownership to do so in cooperation with others. Instead of asking why the com mon law treats land differently from <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>tels, the more appropriate question to ask is why the common law exhibits such suspicion of abandonment as a whole. Approaching the discussion of abandon ment from this perspective points towards connections between the common law of property and conceptions of ownership that view the latter as a social practice suffused with obligation and duty.</p>

<p>Political change doesn’t always begin with a bang; it often starts with just a whisper. From the discussions around kitchen tables that led to the dismantling of the Soviet bloc to the more recent emergence of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> initiatives like MoveOn.org and Redeem the Vote that are revolutionizing the American political landscape, consequential political life develops in small spaces where dialogue generates political power. In The Politics of Small Things, Jeffrey C. Goldfarb provides an innovative way for understanding politics, a way of appreciating the significance of politics at the micro level by comparatively analyzing key turning points and institutions in recent history. He presents a sociology of human interactions that lead from small to large: dissent around the old Soviet bloc; life on the streets in Warsaw, Prague, and Bucharest in 1989; the network of terror that spawned 9/11; and the religious and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> mobilizations that transformed the 2004 presidential election, to name a few. In such pivotal moments, he masterfully shows, political <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> can be generated, presenting alternatives to the big politics of the global stage and the dominant narratives of terrorism, antiterrorism, and globalization.</p>

<i> Arthur Kuflik </i></p>
<p>To what extent should humans transfer, or abdicate, ’’responsibility‘‘ to computers? In this paper, I distinguish six different senses of ’responsible‘ and then consider in which of these senses computers can, and in which they cannot, be said to be ’’responsible‘‘ for ’’deciding‘‘ various outcomes. I sort out and explore two different kinds of complaint against putting computers in greater ’’control‘‘ of our lives: (i) as finite and fallible human beings, there is a limit to how far we can acheive increased reliability through complex devices of our own design; (ii) even when computers are more reliable than humans, certain tasks (e.g., selecting an appropriate gift for a friend, solving the daily crossword puzzle) are inappropriately performed by anyone (or anything) other than oneself. In critically evaluating these claims, I arrive at three main conclusions: (1) While we ought to correct for many of our shortcomings by availing ourselves of the computer‘s larger memory, faster processing speed and greater stamina, we are limited by our own finiteness and fallibility (rather than by whatever limitations may be inherent in silicon and metal) in the ability to transcend our own unreliability. Moreover, if we rely on programmed computers to such an extent that we lose touch with the human experience and insight that formed the basis for their programming design, our fallibility is magnified rather than mitigated. (2) Autonomous moral agents can reasonably defer to greater expertise, whether human or <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netic. But they cannot reasonably relinquish ’’background-oversight‘‘ responsibility. They must be prepared, at least periodically, to review whether the ’’expertise‘‘ to which they defer is indeed functioning as he/she/it was authorized to do, and to take steps to revoke that authority, if necessary. (3) Though outcomes matter, it can also matter how they are brought about, and by whom. Thus, reflecting on how much of our lives should be directed and implemented by computer may be another way of testing any thoroughly end-state or consequentialist conception of the good and decent life. To live with meaning and purpose, we need to actively engage our own faculties and empathetically connect up with, and resonate to, others. Thus there is some limit to how much of life can be appropriately lived by anyone (or anything) other than ourselves.</p>

<p>This volume examines the changing contours of global capitalism at the end of the century, and demonstrates that no democracy worth the name can any longer be conceived except in terms of a fundamental break with it. In the process, it exposes many illusory responses to globalisation. The essays published here on the contradictions that have been undermining the Swedish, Rhineland and East Asian ‘models’ go far towards showing how vacuous are the currently fashionable proposals for a ‘third way’ (even those advanced in Cuba). But it is not only the crisis of all models implicated in globalisation that concerns us here. The essays in this volume also reveal the shallowness and growing instability of the ‘democracy’ peddled and often put in place by global capitalism’s ideologues and state functionaries from Latin America to Russia. That it was always a serious error to take East Asia as offering a model of any kind was very clear long before the economic cataclysm that has now engulfed that region. But even in the core capitalist countries, as several of the essays here also show, democracy is increasingly thin, the public sphere and the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the state having been drastically curtailed by market forces, and the social democratic parties having been hollowed out by the very political elites who pretend that their ‘third way’ is a solution to, rather than a symptom of, the crisis of the left. Yet there is no easy way forward. Among the obstacles examined by the contributors to this volume are, for example, the western working classes’ complex implication in globalisation through their pension funds as well as through trade union support for ‘progressive competitiveness’, and the readiness of some left intellectuals to embrace the idea of a new non-material ‘<span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-economy’. Many such problems will have to be confronted and overcome before effective movements able to challenge and transcend the forces that have brought us globalisation will be able to emerge and develop strategies, not only for democratising the economy and the state, but for reconstructing a public sphere where socialist voices can once again be heard. Such movements will need to discover how to make democracy simultaneously meaningful and effective at the local, national and global levels, not least by building new linkages between these levels.</p>

<p>The present study reports on correlational data gathered from an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> survey to explore why forced-choice dilemma situations relate to depressive symptoms among multiracial people (N = 317). Specifically, a model was tested that explored the role of identity <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (the extent to which multiracial people feel they can racially identify however they desire) and public regard (the extent to which multiracial people think others value their multiracial identity). The results of the model suggest that forced-choice dilemmas predict greater depressive symptoms because forcedchoice dilemmas may promote greater beliefs that their multiracial identity is devalued in society and more generally restrict identity <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Implications are discussed in terms of multiracial health and public policies regarding assessments of racial identities. jasp_634 1657..1677 Researchers widely accept that people of multiracial heritage face unique challenges associated with their membership in multiple racial categories. These unique challenges have been proposed as precipitating factors in racial identity development, overall psychological health, and the occurrence of problem behaviors, including poor academic performance among multiracial people (Gillem, Cohn, &amp; Throne, 2001; Logan, 1981; Rockquemore &amp; Brunsma, 2002a, 2002b; Shih &amp; Sanchez, 2005). In a review of work on multiracial health, Shih and Sanchez proposed that forced-choice dilemmas may contribute to multiracial people’s psychological well-being. Thus, the present study is designed to examine empirically the possible link between self-reported experiences of forced-choice dilemmas and psychological wellbeing, as well as the mechanisms that may account for the relationship. Forced-choice dilemmas refer to situations in which multiracial people are asked or pressured to choose between their multiple racial identities, rather than being allowed to identify with their multiple racial identities (Standen, 1996). Because of the difficulties multiracial people face, many theorists have erroneously predicted that multiracial people will exhibit worse</p>

<p>Online surveys and interviews, the observations of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> rooms or online games, data mining, knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), collecting biomarkers, employing biometrics, using RFID technology - even as implants in the human body - and other related processes all seem to be more promising, cheaper, faster, and comprehensive than conventional methods of human subjects research. But at the same time these new means of gathering information may pose powerful threats to privacy, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and informed consent. Online research, particularly involving children and minors but also other vulnerable groups such as ethnic or religious minorities, is in urgent need of an adequate research ethics that can provide reasonable and morally justified constraints for human subjects research. The paper at hand seeks to provide some clarification of these new means of information gathering and the challenges they present to moral concepts like privacy, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, informed consent, beneficence, and justice. Some existing codes of conduct and ethical guidelines are examined to determine whether they provide answers to those challenges and/or whether they can be helpful in the development of principles and regulations governing human subjects research. Finally, some conclusions and recommendations are presented that can help in the task of formulating an adequate research ethics for human subjects research.</p>

<p>This article examines the relevance of modern technology for the development of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the process of learning English as a foreign language. Computer-assisted language learning and computer mediated communication (CMC) appear to be particularly conducive to fostering autonomous learning, as they naturally incorporate many elements of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> that give learners control over and responsibility for their own learning, such as choosing the materials used, managing their contact with various genres and types of interaction, often in authentic contexts, and evaluating their own progress, measured through their success in understanding and conveying meanings. However, providing access to language resources does not automatically lead to the development of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, as much depends on other factors, such as the learners’ level or previous experience in learner training. The present study investigated whether advanced learners of English made use of out-of-class CMC engagement for the purpose of learning English autonomously. The results indicate that most of the participants were eager to use CMC opportunities to deliberately practice their English, although, quite naturally, leisure and social reasons for using CMC predominated. The expressed willingness to deliberately focus on practicing English during beyond-theclassroom meaning-oriented online interactions confirms the great potential of CMC as an <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> enhancement tool.</p>

<p>This case study explains varied perspectives on a difficult dialogue. It provides recommendations for student affairs professionals and faculty members who work with students and teach courses in content areas that are related to diversity, social justice, and privilege. Educators who prepare multiculturally competent students use a variety of methods to accomplish this task. Regardless of the method, however, achieving multicultural competence inevitably involves difficult dialogues regarding race, religion, and sexual orientation. This article presents an actual case describing what happened when a difficult dialogue about race took place in a classroom setting. Student development theory including Helm’s (1990) White Identity Development model, Perry’s (1970) Scheme and Watt’s (2007) Privileged Identity Exploration (PIE) model are used to provide a theoretical framework in case analysis to discuss the involved parties’ behavior. Helms (1990) contends that Whites are innately benefactors of racism. Thus, she proposed a White racial identity development model designed to assist Whites in the process of adopting a nonracist White identity; for this to happen, Whites must abandon personal racism as well as recognize and actively renounce institutional and cultural racism. Phase I of the model Abandonment of Racism has three statuses: (1) Contact, (2) Disintegration and (3) Reintegration. Phase II - Defining a Nonracist White Identity also has three statuses: (1) Pseudo-Independence (2) Immersion-Emersion and (3) <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> (see Helms, 1990). Perry’s (1970) Scheme of Cognitive and Ethical Development consists of nine positions which students move through with respect to intellectual and moral development. These stages are characterized in terms of the student’s attitude towards knowledge and are grouped into four categories: Dualism, Multiplicity, Relativism and Commitment (see Perry, 1970). Watt’s Privileged Identity Exploration (PIE) Model consists of eight defensive reactions, motivated by fear and entidement, when one encounters difficult dialogue. These defensive reactions are grouped under three categories: Category I -Recognizing Privilege Identity has three defense modes (1) denial, (2) deflection, and (3) rationalisation. Category II Contemplating privileged Identity consists of (1) intellectualisation, (2) principium and (3) false envy. Category III-Addressing Privileged Identity includes (1) Benevolence and (2) Minimisation (Watt, 2007). Collectively, these theories focus on cognitive and affective as well as behavioral changes in college students (and others), and encourage student affairs practitioners and faculty members to explore creative and collaborative methods for reducing oppressive actions in the classroom and on campus. Below the case will be presented and then analyzed using the aforementioned developmental theories. The article will conclude with practical applications for student affairs professionals and faculty members. The Case (The names in the following case are pseudonyms) Dominique Stephens is an African American associate professor who has taught diversity related graduate courses in a predominately White institution for nearly a decade. She is keenly aware of how racism shapes students’, particularly White students’, reactions and responses to her as a teacher and to her as an expert on how race informs college student affairs practice. Yet, she was surprised and frustrated by the events she endured one semester while teaching the Diversity in Education course. After attending a few classes, a White male student, Kent Peterson, contacted Professor Stephens via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>, indicating his discomfort with her course and the comments she and his fellow students made about race and racism. She invited Mr.&nbsp;Peterson to meet with her to discuss his concerns. Instead, Mr.&nbsp;Peterson sent another <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>, which he copied to her department chair, stating that the classroom environment was hostile to White males and that he was uncertain about returning to class. …</p>

<p>The rural wireless networks are increasingly in demand by associations and autarchies to expand <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> access in this type of areas. The problem of such solutions centers not only in network deployment and its maintenance, but also in the equipment installation on clients, which always has big costs. This installation and configuration must be performed by a technician on site, so that the equipment can be integrated in the infrastructure. To try to mitigate this problem, it is presented a solution that allows the clients to install, with transparency, the device at home, reducing not only the cost for the management entity but also for the clients. This way, for info-excluded people or with new technology low experience level, it is the user that integrates himself in the network, making him part of the process, fostering the network usage. In this article are specified not only the system architecture but also the way that it works and how it obtains the desirable result. The tests made to the solution show the quickness, reliability and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the execution of the tasks, making it a benefit for rural wireless networks. This solution, by its robustness and simplicity, allowed an uptake to the IT by people who never thought to do it, namely an advanced age group (elderly) who want to join the world of the new technologies</p>

<p>Access to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social network site</span>s (SNS) in the workplace has been much debated. While some consider SNS a distraction, others consider them a tool for professional socialisation and that recreational access positively impacts satisfaction. This exploratory study reports results from an online survey of employees from one faculty of an Australian university, exploring how they used <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> at work and how they would react to a hypothetical <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> ban. Three-quarters of respondents used <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> at work, primarily for personal socialisation during breaks. Many self-imposed a strict personal/professional separation, but opposed a hypothetical SNS ban, perceiving it as an infringement on their workplace <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. It is argued that university employees - academic and professional - can be trusted to self-regulate access.</p>

<p>I. Introduction Faculty members have been described as purveyors of culture, engines of economic development, and generators of scientific, medical, and technological discoveries that transform human society (Schuster &amp; Finkelstein, 2006). They have been characterized as institutional agents who can foster the development of social and cultural capital, particularly within and among historically disadvantaged communities (Stanton-Salazar, 1997). Faculty have been at the forefront of social change movements, and have been viewed as teachers and mentors who can empower students to achieve their highest potential (Kingston-Mann &amp; Sieber, 2001). But faculty have also been described, by critics, as scam artists who focus on self-interested agendas at the expense of the education of tuition-paying students (Sykes, 1988). Collectively, faculties and their academic disciplines have been defined by some postmodernists as closed communities that endorse only certain forms of knowledge generation, primarily those forms that reinforce the power positions of well-established interests within those disciplines (Foucault, 1986). Recently, faculty have been characterized as managed professionals, whose <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> has been eroded by extensive accountability-oriented measurement systems (Rhoades, 1998) and by a rising managerialism among college and university administrators, who now are more likely to make major decisions without faculty input (Bess, 2006). These various images and metaphors suggest that expectations for the academic profession have become highly differentiated and fragmented. No longer does a quick reference to teaching, research, and service suffice to explain the work of the faculty member. Faculty roles have become increasingly complex and challenging, both for individuals to carry out and for institutions to support. Despite the multitude of images and descriptors associated with academic work, one commonality is that faculty members are people who have human needs for growth, achievement, satisfaction, and connection with others (Deci &amp; Ryan, 2000). Faculty development programs can play an important role on college and university campuses by acknowledging the human needs of faculty members, and by providing the resources, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networks, and innovative ideas that can foster the fulfillment of those needs. This paper reports on an innovative faculty development program that focused its energies on the idea that fulfilling the human needs of faculty members is an essential prerequisite</span> for ongoing growth and success within the academic profession. Many faculty development programs are organized around meeting functional needs, rather than human needs. These programs, many based in centers for teaching and learning, focus on the functional roles that faculty perform, and attempt to identify key areas within those functions that present unique challenges for faculty (e.g., teaching with technology or assessing students’ writing). These functional needs are sometimes identified systematically through a survey of faculty members, but more often the needs are identified by a faculty committee, or by an academic administrator charged with responsibilities for faculty development (Sorcinelli, Austin, Eddy, &amp; Beach, 2006). Once the functional needs have been identified, programs and services are designed to identify and convey a set of skills that can be used to improve performance within a given function (Akerlind, 2005). The programs may be tailored to fit the needs of particular faculty groups, such as junior faculty or discipline-specific issues (e.g., teaching large lecture courses in the sciences). Although these programs may acknowledge different needs by career stage and by academic discipline, they typically are not organized around foundational human needs. The goal of many of these faculty development programs is to teach faculty, for example, how to use technology or how to assess students’ writing, rather than to fulfill faculty members’ needs for growth, achievement, and collegial connection. …</p>

<p>Continuing working until the pension age? Relations between work characteristics and the estimated work ability Continuing working until the pension age? Relations between work characteristics and the estimated work ability Gedrag &amp; Organisatie, volume 24, November 2011, nr. 4, pp.&nbsp;392-410.The Dutch and Belgian government attempts to let employees work longer with financial measures in order to solve the threatening shortness of labor forces. Until today this approach seems to be less successful. For this reason this study investigated, within the frame of the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model, whether the job characteristics workload, emotional and physical demands, cognitive demands, learning opportunities, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and relation with the supervisor are related to someone’s expectation to be able to continue his job until the pension age. This study found several new practical and theoretical insights. It turned out that there were significant relations for workload, emotional and physical demands, learning opportunities and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> with someone’s expectation to be able to continue his job until the pension age. Psychological exhaustion as well as work pleasure had a mediating role in these relations. Using multiple mediation model analysis the research model was tested on the data of 2107 employees of 50 year or older of the Flemish Workability Monitor 2007.</p>

<p>ABSTRACT Financial planner perceptions are made up of a complex neural blend of client management qualities, client demographic qualities, personal qualities, business practice qualities, and job qualities. This study empirically assesses perceptions of the financial planning professional to find those factors seen to be most important and least important contributing to financial planner self reported success. The data utilized within this study were gathered via a survey instrument developed and administered in an online format during the months of June and July 2008. A total of 403 geographically diverse respondents (4% response rate) who are members of the FPA and agree to receive <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> from the organization answered the survey. The final sample used after significant non-response cases were eliminated was 349 respondents (3.5%). Findings of this study indicate that client relationships, wealth of client served, use of ethical practices, ability to empathize, number of clients served, client referrals, and job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> are among the most important contributors to financial planner perceived success. (ProQuest: … denotes formula omitted.) INTRODUCTION The financial planning profession provides a unique research opportunity for scholars and practitioners alike. Little if any empirical research has been conducted to this point conceptualizing and evaluating career success dimensions within financial planning. Career success dimensions such as client management, client demographic, personal, job scope, and business practice factors will provide further insight into the perceptions of the financial planner, their job functions, and their self reported level of success. The purpose of this research is to analyze perceptions of these factors and to evaluate which factors are perceived to contribute most to the financial planner. Research within financial planning enhances the opportunity for working world solutions to be developed for the benefit of the profession and those who work daily as financial planners. LITERATURE REVIEW In the 1950’ s, noted social psychologist Fritz Heider developed a theory explaining how individuals attribute behavior of themselves and others. Heider’ s work, known as attribution theory, is a cognitive theory associated with success and interpersonal relationships (Heider, 1958). Attribution theory is the exploration of an individual’s awareness of cause and effect scenarios and how the outcomes of such scenarios affect the individual’s perception of usefulness. Heider proposed that people strive for prediction and understanding of daily events in order to give their lives stability and predictability (Heider). Fullin and Mills (1995) write of attribution theory as applied to the field of sports, whereby athletes use awareness of cause and effect scenarios to adjust performance output. Attribution theory divides the way an individual attributes causes to events into two distinct categories: external and internal. External attribution assigns causality to an outside factor, such as client demographics or job qualities, in the current study, or competition in the sports analogy. Internal attribution assigns causality to inside factors of the person, such as personal factors and business practices in the current study, or ability and luck in the sports analogy. Thus, when one measures his or herself or compares his or herself to others, attribution theory is engaged by way of comparison. One may make these comparisons and attribute differences to either internal or external deficiencies. Once the deficiencies are known, the individual can adjust the internal or external factors to attain a desired state. In the case of an athlete, once deficiencies are known, adjustments to ability, effort, and task difficulty can be made. Mittra, Potts, and LaBrecque (2005) argue the financial planner is at times like a football quarterback moderating the plays of financial life around the key planning areas in a strategic manner. …</p>

<p>US is unique amongst developed states in preferring private adoption, a position that Katz associates with the American bias towards market mechanisms and preference for individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> over state regulation. Adoption involves the legal, permanent transfer of a child from the birth parent or parents to new caregivers. In intercountry adoption, this transfer occurs across an international border. The child usually moves to a new country, to parents of different race, culture and language from the birth family, and acquires a new nationality. The child’s new identity replaces his or her original one. Adoption, therefore, it is appropriate to say involves losses as well as gains. This paper examines the use of intercountry adoption to provide for children in the most disadvantaged conditions. It discusses whether and how international legal instruments and domestic measures can combine to ensure proper standards are applied to such adoptions. (1) In doing so it accepts that intercountry adoption can and should be regulated, rejecting both the alternatives of a free market and a complete ban on adoption. The paper argues that regulatory standards, particularly the control of private adoptions, are required to ensure that abuses such as abduction and trafficking of children are eliminated. Also, as a child welfare measure that has the potential to compromise the human rights of both birth parents and children, adoption should only be used where it is appropriate to the child’s situation. Adoption is known to make psychological demands on the parties beyond those of natural parenthood. For this reason, the paper proposes that research knowledge and experience should be applied so that the arrangements made provide the best chance for stable, long-term relationships for children who have been adopted. (2) ORIGINS OF INTERCOUNTRY ADOPTION Intercountry adoption came about largely as an altruistic response to the plight of war orphans and the abandoned children of servicemen in World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. It now involves the transfer of more than 30,000 children each year from over 50 countries. (3) With few exceptions, children move from poor countries to wealthy ones. (4) In the main receiving countries–the United States, Canada and most countries of Western Europe–the number of such adoptions has doubled over the last decade. Many factors have contributed to this increase. In receiving countries, the decline in fertility associated with postponing marriage, the limited success and high cost of infertility treatment and a lack of domestic adoption opportunities have made intercountry adoption an alternative to childlessness. Intercountry adoption has also become easier as information about how it can be achieved has become more readily available, most recently via the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. In states of origin (sending countries), extreme poverty, lack of contraception and attitudes to birth outside of marriage are three major factors leading to the abandonment of children to institutions. (5) In Eastern Europe, social and economic collapse following the end of communist regimes left orphanages close to destitution. Those responsible for these institutions, the welfare organizations that support them and would-be parents in other countries, have all seen intercountry adoption as a solution. In China, the one-child policy and the cultural preference for boys have led to the abandonment of large numbers of girls to under-funded and inadequate institutions. In response to these phenomena, organizations have sprung up to facilitate intercountry adoption. For many of these agencies, acting as an intermediary has become a business. Because of the increase in international adoptions, a new legal regime has been developed. In 1993, the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption was signed to create an international framework for arranging and formalizing these adoptions and to prevent abuses. …</p>

<p>Background: This study aimed to explore the associations between personality factors, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, religion and risk behaviours (RBs) among students. Methods: Six separate binary logistic regression models were built to explore associations of problematic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> use (PIU), binge drinking and smoking for boys and girls (807 students, 75% females, 19.6 mean age) with personality variables (Plasticity, Stability), <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (awareness of self), religion (importance &amp; attendance). Findings: The individual models revealed that PIU was associated with Plasticity and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for both genders and with Stability for boys. Binge drinking was associated with Plasticity for both genders, with importance of religion for boys and attendance for girls. Smoking was associated with Plasticity for both genders, with <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for boys and Stability and religious attendance for girls. Discussion: A higher level of Plasticity seems to be generally associated with RBs while Stability, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and religion, although differently for each gender, is protective. This distinction may be an important aspect of prevention programs.</p>

<p>From the mid-nineties on, European welfare states are facing formidable pressures. As a response to these pressures, a strong international reform agenda has found support around the ideas that benefit recipients have to be “activated” in order to find Jobs. Such approaches conceive the aim of welfare states to strengthen Social Policy as a productive factor and to provide the “right” incentives and compulsion (carrots and sticks) in order to control and design behaviour of persons (van Berkel, 2010; Handler, 2004). On an ideological level, these developments correspond to a shift from previously contested assumptions about human motivation, choice, agency and human responsibility of beneficaries of the welfare state. In Critical Social Policy research, a discussion has emerged around the models of human motivation and agency that have been influential in policy design (see e.g.&nbsp;Le Grand, 2003; Deacon, 2005; White, 2013). The article argues that conceptions of human agency have important political implications when it comes to debates about individual responsibility. This may lead to so called “<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> gaps” (Anderson, 2009), or to situations in which welfare beneficaries perceive the instituionalized imperative to <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> as an injunction. The article confronts the capability approach (C.A.) to different competing sociological conceptions of human agency. On the basis of an empirical study of the construction of welfare subjects through activation policies, the article points to some shortcomings of the C.A. especially for the analysis of the micro-workings of power in post-disciplinary societies, in which the exercise of power does not so much consist of imposing direct constraints upon citizens as of “governing trough freedom”. For this reason, the article argues that Sen’s realization-based approach needs to be supplemented by concepts which allow accounting for the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>tedness of individual identities and for the social construction of subjectivity within different social contexts.</p>

<p>The trend towards an increase in pro se litigation challenges all court systems. Criminal courts face unique challenges maintaining the integrity of the criminal adjudicatory process while balancing the competing interests of moving cases efficiently through the system, respecting defendant <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and honoring due process. Holding pro se litigants to the same standards as attorneys, just one of the challenges inherent in allowing pro se defendant representation, can prove difficult because defendants often lack the necessary education, experience and social knowledge about how a courtroom works. As the pro se movement shows no signs of decreasing, courts must make an effort to accommodate these defendants with a plan that addresses court efficiency, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and judicial process integrity concerns. Scholars generally agree that providing pro se defendants with a “road map, a passive tool, [that] lets them competently exercise their own route” can address many of the issues courts encounter when pro se defendants enter the system. Previous scholars have suggested potential solutions that could come from courts, non-profit organizations, or even law offices. One scholar has argued that the middle class has a significant unmet legal need in civil litigation cases and that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> might be the key to facilitating access to justice. This paper will take these arguments further and apply them to criminal court cases, highlighting unique considerations of the criminal justice process. This paper will address both how courts can use <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> to assist pro se criminal defendants and why doing so improves individual and community relationships with the courts and furthers procedural justice goals. This paper proposes a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social Media</span> Toolkit provided and overseen by a community’s local court that allows pro se defendants to interact with court staff and to access informational videos that will assist them in resolving their cases. As the influence and pervasiveness of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> increases, many organizations and businesses have implemented strategies to reach out online to the communities they once served exclusively in person. State courts are no exception. Some state courts have implemented parts of the proposed toolkit. This paper will discuss those examples and advocate for increased <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> engagement in communities where it is absent.</p>

<p>e-Portfolios are a form of authentic assessment with formative functions that include showcasing and sharing learning artifacts, documenting reflective learning processes, connecting learning across various stages and enabling frequent feedback for improvements. This paper examines how e-portfolios take up these formative roles to support productive learning. Qualitative findings from interviews with selected first-year undergraduate students at a higher education institution in Hong Kong are reported concerning students’ experiences of constructing e-portfolios as assessment tasks. As part of an institutional teaching and learning initiative, e-portfolios were incorporated into three core courses for first-year students. The findings reveal that several conditions necessary to foster productive learning were missing in students’ experiences: strengthened formative role of e-portfolios through coherent assessment design; encouragement for students’ pursuit of authentic tasks to develop learning interests; engagement of students in reflective and self-regulative learning as an essential learning process; provision of constructive feedback for sustained learning support; and support for students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> through facilitation of collaborative knowledge building. By explicating how the lack of these conditions impeded students’ active involvement in e-portfolio tasks and suggesting relevant strategies for teachers at the institution in question, this paper offers implications for harnessing <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y ( ICT) to support students’ productive learning.

<p>The world of women and work is aptly included in the social science literature but is the world of women and work, and sex? When women work in the sex industry as strippers, prostitutes or in online <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> rooms, is that employment which is subject to labor law protection and provisions of occupational safety and health? Should it be? For the sex worker, according to this book, much depends on the possibility for authentic sexual feeling to be temporarily removed from the workplace of the sex worker, just as a manger might remove the desire for strict ethical adherence from work in a corporate bureaucracy. If the heart and soul of the sex worker is removed from the workplace, in that case, the sex worker is thought to be employed just like the rest of us. Presently, legal protection for sex workers is not quite socially or politically accepted, but neither has been much of any work by women which comes with complete <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, freedom, and financial benefit. Wherever sex work may be along the continuum of employment-related credibility, it is made more credible in the book On the Game: Women and Sex Work, a researchbased journey into the public and private worlds of female sex workers. On the Game takes a bold position that few other social scientists are willing to take: that sex work is metaphorically no different from any other wage-earning work. The author states, “I introduce views of prostitution as work, comparable to any other…” (p.&nbsp;34). Twice in the book, the author provides a famous quote by Marx: ‘Prostitution is only a particular expression of the universal prostitution of the worker…’ (p.&nbsp;41, p.&nbsp;125; Marx 1975). On the Game attempts to deconstruct accumulated negative stereotypes of sex workers. It is a book not necessarily unwilling to view prostitution through a cultural lens. Rather, it is willing to do anything, so long as it views prostitution as “simply work”, much the same as work done by non-prostitutes.</p>

<p>As LIBRARIANS ADDED AUDIOVISUAL MATERIALS to their collections and then electronic materials, they moved from selection as an individual activity to selection as a group activity. Librarians made every effort to mainstream the resulting selection process and incorporate it into the existing library organization. However, with the advent of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and the ability to simultaneously share virtual resources, cooperative collection development, through consortial arrangements, became popular once again. The ability of consortia to purchase products at a better price than individual libraries can has made them very popular with funding agencies. However, the result is that the role of the selector has been diminished. As the purchase of virtual resources accelerates, particularly through consortial agreements, the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the local library will fade and the roles of librarians will change drastically. This rapid transformation is illustrated by a discussion of OhioLINK and its effects, both positive and negative, on one member library.</p>

<p>Several researchers have emphasized the significant role of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>y (ICT) in advancing the process of teaching and learning at schools. Therefore, a number of countries started to introduce ICT resources in all levels. Similarly, the Kuwaiti Ministry of Education (MoE) has recently mandated that all school staff meet certain standards to ensure that they have the ability to use ICT resources in their schools. However, the literature indicates that the integration of ICT in the classroom does not only rest in the hands of teachers; school principals also play a vital role in determining the success or failure of ICT use in the teaching process. This study sought to document the impact of Kuwaiti secondary school principals on their teachers’ attitude toward ICT embedding in classroom teaching. The multiple case studies approach was employed to access data from three secondary schools in Kuwait. Both open ended questionnaires and focus group interviews with 15 teachers were used to collect the data. The data analysis showed that all participating teachers recognized the impact that their principals’ leadership practices had on ICT embedding. They highlighted the effectiveness of the principals’ stimulation and encouragement of ICT embedding, which resulted in a change to the teaching practices, making them more ICT related. The study revealed that school principals in Kuwait had less <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, authority, and opportunity to adopt unique practices and behaviours in leading their schools. Therefore, the study recommends that the MoE revisit its regulations, specifically, those related to the school principals’ roles and responsibilities.

<p>We examine privacy-enhancing technologies based on the consistency of the business plans, technology, stated objectives, and the concept of privacy as embedded in the technologies. Three distinct trust models result from the three distinct concepts of privacy: a right of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, a right to seclusion and a right to property. We use these trust models to segment the privacy market and classify the privacy-enhancing technologies. The Anonymizer and Zero Knowledge’s Freedom were built as technologies to enhance <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, while Privada Control, iPrivacy, and Incogno SafeZone are built to provide seclusion. Microsoft’s Passport is built with an assumption of privacy as a tradable property right. Security, privacy, and authentication are intertwined and sometimes confused in the privacy market. We argue that the creation of new trusted third party is not an effective strategy. In the case of creating a trusted third party, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-based products have been more successful than seclusion-based products, despite the wider array of services offered by seclusion services.</p>

<p>In middle of the 18th century, the providencialist conception of history, which was formulated bytheology and propagated by catholic preaching, was gradually declining.

<p>Motives for Sport Participation as Predictors of Motivation Outcomes in Track and Field: A Self-Determination Theory Perspective Two types of motivation, intrinsic and extrinsic, have been of particular interest to researchers in the field of sport psychology (Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985, 2000, 2008; Vallerand, 1997, 2001). Intrinsic motivation entails participation in an activity for the feelings of fun, pleasure, excitement, and satisfaction associated with it, while extrinsic motivation involves participation for the attainment of such rewards as money, trophies, and social approval or to avoid punishment. One of the most widely applied theoretical approaches to these types of motivation is self-determination theory, or SDT (Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985, 2000; Ryan, 1995; Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000). SDT also involves the concept of amotivation, or having no sense of purpose and lacking intent to engage in a particular behavior. SDT posits that the different types of motivation range on a continuum from high to low self-determination: intrinsic motivation–extrinsic motivation–amotivation (Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985, 2000). Vallerand (1997, 2001) embraced elements of SDT and integrated them within a hierarchical theory of motivation. His model asserts that social factors, mediators (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness), motivations, and consequences (affect, cognition, and behavior) exist at three levels, the global level, contextual level, and situational level. A number of studies have indicated that behavioral regulations spanning the SDT continuum would lead to a corresponding pattern of consequences (Ratelle, Vallerand, Chantal, &amp; Provencher, 2004; Sarrazin, Vallerand, Guillet, Pelletier, &amp; Cury, 2002; Standage, Duda, &amp; Ntoumanis, 2003; Standage &amp; Vallerand, 2008; Taylor, Ntoumanis, &amp; Standage, 2008; Vlachopoulos, Karageorghis, &amp; Terry, 2000; Wilson, Rodgers, Fraser, &amp; Murray, 2004). That is, autonomous regulations and intrinsic motivation are expected to correspond with more positive outcomes, whereas less self-determined forms of regulation (external and introjected regulations) correspond with more negative outcomes, such as poor focus, burnout, and dropout. Vallerand’s proposals have found broad support in a range of sport and physical activity contexts (Standage et al., 2003; Wilson et al., 2004; Ntoumanis, 2001, 2005; Spray, Wang, Biddle, &amp; <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Chat</span>zisarantis, 2006); however, to date no study has examined these proposals in the context of a single sport. The purpose of the present study was to examine the extent to which motives for sport participation predicted motivation outcomes at the contextual level of motivation, thus affording a direct test of Vallerand’s (1997, 2001) model. On the basis of previous work (Ntoumanis, 2001; Vallerand &amp; Bissonnette, 1992; Pelletier, Fortier, Vallerand, Tuson, Briere, &amp; Blais, 1995; Ntoumani &amp; Ntoumanis, 2006), it was hypothesized that identified regulation and the dimensions of intrinsic motivation would be significant positive predictors of motivation outcomes, while amotivation would be a significant negative predictor. Method Participants A sample of 159 volunteer track and field athletes was tested at eight athletics clubs in the London, United Kingdom, area (66 women and 93 men). Their mean age was 19.7 years (SD = 2.8). English was the first language of all participants. Full details of the ethnicity and level of participation of participants can be requested from the second author. Eighty-five athletes participated in sprint events (53.5%), 30 in middle distance events (18.9%), 33 in throwing events (20.7%), 4 in long-distance events (2.5%), and 7 in multievents (4.4%).

<p><span style="background-color:lightgreen">Online social network</span>s OSN are facing challenges since they have been extensively applied to different domains including online <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, e-commerce, biological complex networks, financial analysis, and so on. One of the crucial challenges for OSN lies in information overload and network congestion. The demands for efficient knowledge discovery and data mining methods in OSN have been rising in recent year, particularly for online social applications, such as Flickr, YouTube, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>, and LinkedIn. In this paper, a Belief-Desire-Intention BDI agent-based method has been developed to enhance the capability of mining <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online social network</span>s. Current data mining techniques encounter difficulties of dealing with knowledge interpretation based on complex data sources. The proposed agent-based mining method overcomes network analysis difficulties, while enhancing the knowledge discovery capability through its <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and collective intelligence.</p>

<p>In this paper, which is part of a twelve-month ethnography on the&nbsp;sociocultural practices and meanings ascribed to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s in a low-income neighbourhood in Southern Brazil, I examine various forms of appropriation of this gadget in their intersections with gender relations . Following a literature discussion about gender relations in low-income groups, as well as the role of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s in love/sexual relationships, I argue that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s are appropriated to strengthen love ties, but also cause tension and conflict to arise as they become tools of surveillance. In this sense, I discuss the ways in which <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s engender what Foucault called the micropolitics of daily life, in which men and women interact in sociocultural dynamics that may reproduce gender hierarchies, but also hold the potential to subvert them. As such, the analysis also pays attention to the vitality and humour present in women’s narratives, in order to argue that these seem to be connected to a certain <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the female persona. The discussion engages with the work of various other researchers internationally and in Brazil and reflects on the cross-cultural implications of these practices in relation to similar studies in Africa.</p>

<p>Higher education teachers are steadily challenged to adopt and use <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICT) during their everyday tasks. Moreover, interplay between teaching and research demands creation and configuration of new learning environments to overcome a technology-focused approach and provide a more significant, enhanced teaching experience. Therefore it is reasonable for them to include collaborative and autonomous components as a learning strategy to simplify the acquisition of knowledge from a hands-on experience based on students’ interests. The methodology used in this work involved a literature review with a focus on analyzing the interpretation of several basic texts, the categorization and analysis of the teaching skills from a constructivist perspective within the ICT framework, allowing for a development of autonomous and collaborative education. Thus, the conclusions of this analysis point to a regular teachers’ training as one of the most important components of an action plan toward the successful implementation of teaching strategies that encourage an active involvement of students under teacher`s guide, whose main role is to stimulate the activation of the students’ metacognitive abilities and attitudes.</p>

<p>The paper presents the findings of a quasi-experimental study which sought to explore the effectiveness of online resources on the development of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and to determine whether increased <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> results in greater pronunciation gains as well as to compare it with the effects of traditional instruction when it comes to individual students. What is more, the study sets out to determine whether the gains in the two areas are maintained over time with respect to individual learners. The subjects were 45 Polish senior high school learners. The targeted structure was the final -ed sound of the simple past tense of regular English verbs. Three groups, two experimental and one control group, participated in the study. The intervention spanned the period of two weeks. The learners in Experimental Group 1 were provided with access to the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and were thus allowed to exercise more freedom in learning English pronunciation. The students in Experimental Group 2 were taught in a traditional way (i.e.&nbsp;controlled by the teacher) and the learners in the control group did not receive any instruction. The data were collected by means of a pronunciation <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> questionnaire, as well as pronunciation tests administered before and after the study was concluded. The results reveal that the majority of individual students in Experimental Group 1 showed more <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and they outperformed their counterparts on the tests, which provides a justification for using digital technology as a tool for promoting <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and teaching pronunciation.</p>

Traditional clinical scenarios can be viewed as closed-loop systems where caregivers are the controllers, medical devices act as sensors and actuators, and patients are the ‘‘plants.’’ MedCPSs alter this view by introducing additional computational entities that aid caregivers.

<p>This article examines higher education reforms in the Republic of Georgia, tracing changes before and after the Rose Revolution. The transformation of this higher education system is one of gradual evolution, moving from a centrally controlled and corrupt system into a more transparent and organized system through a series of reforms, including (1) legislative changes, (2) institutional reforms, as well as (3) development of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICT) associated with the Bologna process. The article analyzes factors that contributed to the successful implementation of anticorruption reforms, as well as those that continue to hinder reform implementation.

<p>With the increasing instances of transmission of child pornography over the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>, the liability of the host of service providers who facilitate the transmission of the content has become a contentious issue. With varying legal regimes, jurisdictional issues and standards of obscenity applied as well as varying degrees of care to be exercised, this area is a legal quagmire. This article addresses the question of whether we need an intermediary liability regime or not. The article posits that intermediary liability does not address the question of preventing transmission of child pornography as the actual culprits remain beyond the reach of law. A scheme of intermediary liability only acts as a disincentive to the intermediary to innovate and hinders growth of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> services. A comparison of three regimes, United States, European Union and India, is undertaken to see the legislative measures, developments in case law and analyze their stand towards the intermediary. The Article finally works towards arriving at alternative options so that the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the intermediary is not compromised through over-regulation and censorship.</p>

<p>This article describes the constructs of autonomous and controlled, i.e.&nbsp;deeply and superficially internalized, motivation, suggested in self-determination theory, and their application to religious studies.Autonomously motivated activity is performed because it is interesting, personally important and consistent with the values ​​of an individual; controlled motivation comes from the “outside”, either literally (rewards and punishments) or metaphorically (shame and guilt, conditional self-esteem). The theory of self-determination describes the various effects of autonomous and controlled motivation in different areas - depending on its motivation, the same activity may have opposite effects on human well-being. Autonomous motivation is associated with psychological well-being positively, and controlled motivation negatively.The phenomenon of the opposite effect of two types of motivation of the same activity is confirmed in application to religion; also, these types of motivation are associated with the specific religious phenomena - literal or symbolic interpretation of the objects of faith and extremism. Several authors make recommendations on the ways to support the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and psychological well-being of parishioners. The empirical part of the paper presents the results of the validation of the Russian version of the questionnaire of autonomous and controlled motivation in religion (Intrel). Items related to different motivational constructs (subtypes of autonomous and controlled motivation) having sufficient variance and consistency of responses were identified on an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> sample of Orthodox Christians; selected items were factored.

In addition, we infer to the educational process a new pedagogical approach focused to the individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, the co-operation and the communication on the educational intra-system.</p>

<p>Higher Education is not stranger to the changes produced on contemporary societies by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies, because its dimensions of research and teaching have seen modified some of its essential practices. However, if such dimensions aspire to become renovator and not to injure the ultimate sense of the university, they could not undermine the aim of development of the person as person. In this article, we propose a theoretical reflection that considers several key aspects related to the conditions of fostering virtues on virtual higher education: the appropriate conception of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of university students as members of an academic community, the relationships with peers and professors on virtual learning environments, the specificity of academic content, and the formal and relational criteria that support the aesthetic workmanship of higher education.</p>

<p>This article discusses the possibility to include innovation into basic education and to explore within this education, a compatible methodology known as “independent learning”. An additional requirement to contemporary educational processes is to prepare future professionals and the general public to a world where innovation is of great importance. Therefore, it is crucial the role that new technologies, especially digital technologies including the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, can play on the educational experiences of students and teachers throughout their school lives. The main feature of the independent learning approach is to explore the learner’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and it is of key importance to adopt the student as the center of the learning process and, the stimulus to “learn to learn” as the main reference. Although the general definition includes self-learning stricto sensu, in fact, for most cases, within the regular school, in this methodology the protagonists are the integration with the curriculum and the teacher. Likewise, even though the potential use of this approach is, in general, associated with adults, it is at the young age that the habit of learn to learn better develops, more naturally and relevant. We will also present essential issues associated to the third great educational revolution, symbolized by the digital technologies and the innovation’s central role in the contemporary world, which are deeply affecting two key items of the teaching-learning process: the way we produce new knowledge, and the way we construct it pedagogically. So, we quickly evolve to a scenario where the complex digital competence and the vocation for innovation will match, in level of importance, the traditional knowledge and to the typical skills taught in today’s schools, demanding “independent learning” as the appropriate methodology for elementary and intermediate schools.</p>

<p>To the Editor: I read with interest the excellent report by S<span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>te et al.&nbsp;[1] on the reflective writing of medical students during the psychiatry clerkship experience. I strongly agree that narrative reflection can greatly help students process complex and challenging experiences during training, and I think it is particularly useful for us educators to understand and respond to the most important themes that emerge from such reflection. At our institution, we have required students to write a 500word reflective essay at some point during their clerkship, with the general prompt of picking a patient they worked with that stood out for them, writing about what made them stand out. This essay counts for 10 % of their final grade, with student papers assessed for empathy, ability to reflect on meaning, and presentation of broader issues beyond the case. An informal look at the past year of essays shows very similar themes to the ones reported by S<span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>te et al.&nbsp;Out of 159 essays, 18 % emphasized themes of context (that patients do not exist in a vacuum, that family and social forces matter, etc.). Another 17 % addressed the struggle of patients with mental illness, particularly recognizing the severity of illness and functional effects. The third most common theme (16 %) related to challenges in the doctor-patient relationship, particularly countertransference, provider limitations, and resistance. To our surprise, only 5 % of essays addressed issues of patient <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> or paternalism (e.g., coercion, capacity, etc.). We were particularly interested in examining if there were any differences in themes between essays written at the very start of the students’ clerkship year, compared to the writing of students at the very end. Although the combined sample is small (n=38), it does appear that students just starting clerkships were more likely than their veteran peers to write about issues of context and the doctor-patient relationship (50 vs.&nbsp;25 % for both) and less likely to address issues of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, severity, or patient-centered care. When we sit down with students to discuss the clerkship experience, these are the issues we now highlight, both at the outset and during the clerkship, in an effort to help students more productively and safely grow into their professional identity and role. Using reflective writing as a prompt for group discussion can further deepen the value of such writing [2]. Finally, it also seems important that such a process takes place throughout the medical curriculum, not just on psychiatry. Although the psychiatry clerkship certainly raises unique and powerful issues related to patient care, the most common themes raised by students certainly occur in many clinical contexts, and students are likely to benefit from reflection on all clerkships. At our institution, we have successfully encouraged other clerkships to add a writing component to the requirements, and other medical schools do reflective writing throughout the curriculum, which seems to be a particularly useful way to help students with their professional development.</p>

<p>“Yu Lun Jian Du,” or the Chinese media’s practice of scrutinizing government activity, has become a popular discourse in China. This study stresses that: (1) by institutional arrangement, China’s media are “mouthpieces” of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and their “Yu Lun Jian Du” practice has always been under strict party control; (2) as a media discourse, “Yu Lun Jian Du” helps journalists pursue professional <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> under the premise of conformity to party rules; (3) the emergence of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> affords unprecedented possibilities for free expression, however, it has as yet not subverted China’s established media system.

<p>This study seeks to discuss plagiarism in the academic context as an act that has increased significantly due to free access to digital hypertexts. Considering that there are texts from diverse fields of knowledge circulating on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>, undergraduate students find it easier to copy than to construct their own authorship. In order to contribute to this discussion, this study intends to reflect on the need to open objective and subjective spaces in the University - the place for the production of language - in order to make construction of authorship effective in the dialectic between the individual and the collective. In this sense, reading and writing practices should be experienced as the motivation for intellectual production, with the intention of providing the student, as a future teacher, with the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> needed to write and to establish him or herself as author, as he or she navigates the digital network.</p>

<p>In Sweden, as in many other European countries, government and public agencies have promoted the expansion of eHealth in recent years, arguing that this development enhances patient participation, empowerment and cost efficiency. This article presents a study of the development of My medical record on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, a civic service originally inspired by the home banking concept. The study illustrates how the technology is developed and inscribed with new technical norms, dictating access and use. These norms are in turn shaped by negotiations between social and legal norms as well as the values and beliefs of several different actors involved in the development process. Supported by the study, we conclude: 1) that the new technology challenges the medical professionals, thus causing resistance as the institutional boundaries are changed when patients are given digital access to their medical record; 2) that the technology changes or inscribes the law; 3) that a pilot project of this type is dependent on an enthusiast, seeing the project through until it becomes accepted on a larger scale; and 4) that increased patient participation requires improved access to information which differs from the NPM rhetoric advocating more service to customers.</p>

<p>In its “Philippine Information Society” discourse, the State promotes Filipino service-based ICT skills while condemning other “offensive” and “illegal” activities, such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>sex. This dichotomy fails to capture the complex nature of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>sex phenomenon, and accordingly, the varied lived experiences of individuals in the context of an emergent “Information Society.” We wish to broaden the discursive space by adopting the affective labor perspective and showcasing <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>sex narratives that traverse themes of exploitation, negotiation, resistance, and agency in ICT use. Using two case studies, we illustrate how <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>sex is experienced, organized, mediated, and made meaningful. We also describe how laborers are inscribed in mechanisms of surveillance and control, as they develop counter-measures to compromise, challenge or take advantage of these mechanisms. Our analysis reveals that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>sex laborers create value, not just in monetizing their labor, but also in pursuing <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, personal development, and kinship-oriented care. The lived experiences of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>sex laborers also produce new and potent forms of bio-politics. These multi-faceted narratives problematize the State-sponsored ICT discourse. On one hand, laborers embody the impositions made upon service-based labor by the global digital economy: rudimentary technological skills, the ability to speak English, the ability to empathize and foster customer relations. On the other, their exclusion engendered the refusal to be subjected to the standards and prerequisites of the legitimate, “formal” digital economy. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span>sex’s anomalous position, we contend, is a reflexive by-product of the neoliberal digital economy that puts premium less on ICT for development and more on labor that serves, foremost, ICT for capital.</p>

<p>In large-scale <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>-based distributed systems, participants (consumers and providers) are typically autonomous, i.e.&nbsp;they may have special interests towards queries and other participants. In this context, a way to avoid a participant to voluntarily leave the system is satisfying its interests when allocating queries. However, participants satisfaction may also be negatively affected by the failures of other participants. Query replication is a solution to deal with providers failures, but, it is challenging because of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>: it cannot only quickly overload the system, but also it can dissatisfy participants with uninteresting queries. Thus, a natural question arises: should queries be replicated? If so, which ones? and how many times? In this paper, we answer these questions by revisiting query replication from a satisfaction and probabilistic point of view. We propose a new algorithm, called S b QR, that decides on-the-fly whether a query should be replicated and at which rate. As replicating a large number of queries might overload the system, we propose a variant of our algorithm, called S b QR+. The idea is to voluntarily fail to allocate as many replicas as required by consumers for low critical queries so as to keep resources for high critical queries during query-intensive periods. Our experimental results demonstrate that our algorithms significantly outperform the baseline algorithms from both the performance and satisfaction points of view. We also show that our algorithms automatically adapt to the criticality of queries and different rates of participant failures.</p>

Improving health care locally, regionally and globally by using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y is an important goal of eHealth and its applications. The aim of this review is to describe different ethical aspects of eHealth applications. This article is a systematic review. Relevant literature was searched from databases and 18 chosen articles were analyzed by using a data based qualitative content analysis. Six ethical aspects concerning eHealth and its applications were found from the reviewed literature: <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, privacy, confidentiality, consent, equality of service availability and beneficence. eHealth applications have a potential to improve health care services comprehensively, especially in remote areas. There are still ethical concerns that need to be addressed as the technology continues to develop. eHealth can be an effective addition to traditional health care services as long as the health and wellbeing of patients remain as the central point and eHealth applications are not used only to gain financial savings.</p>

<p>Knowledge issues are central to governance choice. Organization structure influences knowledge flows and costs of knowledge creation and exchange inside the firm. Yet the question of how a firm’s internal structure affects its governance choice for new activities has received scant empirical attention. We examine the role of internal structure, specifically unit <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and lateral coordination, in a firm’s governance decision for new, knowledge-intensive activities. The findings show that internal structure is a ‘shift parameter’ that affects governance choice by moderating the relationship between task complexity and degree of integration. The empirical setting is the U.S. banking industry and its adoption of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> banking. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The everyday uses of networked media technologies, especially <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, have revolutionized the classical model of top-down surveillance. This article sketches the contours of an emerging culture of interveillance where non-hierarchical and non-systematic monitoring practices are part of everyday life. It also introduces a critical perspective on how the industrial logics of dominant <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, through which interveillance practices are normalized, resonate with social forces already at play in individualized societies. The argument is developed in three steps. Firstly, it is argued that the concept of interveillance is needed, and must be distinguished from surveillance, in order to critically assess the everyday mutual sharing and disclosure of private information (of many different kinds). Secondly, it is argued that the culture of interveillance responds to the social deficit of recognition that characterizes highly individualized societies. Finally, it is argued that the culture of interveillance constitutes a defining instance and even represents a new stage of the meta-process of mediatization. The dialectical nature of interveillance integrates and reinforces the overarching ambiguities of mediatization, whereby the opportunities for individuals and groups to achieve growing freedom and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> are paralleled by limitations and dependences vis-a-vis media.</p>

<p>New model of teaching and learning was introduced in our school to meet the needs of our students who seek greater <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, connectivity as well as opportunities for socio-experiential learning. The Connected Learning Pedagogy (CLP) was designed to mine the learning potential of the new social and digital media domain to create a community of ownership of learning, promoting collaboration and connectedness among students, lecturers and parents. To support the implementation of CLP, laboratories were equipped with computers and tablet PCs. Through them, students were connected to various social and digital media such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>, Moodle, YouTube and iDeâ€™Lite (ITE video portal) to conduct their required research and learning. The tablet PCs provided lecturers with the added advantage of mobility during lessons, allowing them to facilitate the learning process with ease. Students were engaged in many exciting ways through Apps in the tablet PCs. In addition, parents were connected to students learning through PRISM (ITE Parentsâ€™ Real-time Information System on Mobile).

<p>Abstract Socio-<span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>physical networks tightly integrate humans, real-world objects and IT infrastructure. In some cases of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>physical networks, their configuration can be done in a centralized way (e.g., automated production line configuration). However, for socio-<span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>physical networks the centralized control is not possible due to the independence and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the network members (e.g., employees of an enterprise). The paper proposes an approach to model such network via a set of interacting socio-inspired services. Such services are capable to model behavior of the network participants taking into account their preferences, strategies and social norms. The interoperability of the services is achieved due to the usage of common standards (such as WSDL and SOAP) at the technological level, and common ontology at the semantic level. The developed conceptual model of socio-inspired service is presented together with behavior patterns and methods for their processing.</p>

<p>According to western democracy, which demands the fundamentals of individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, freedom of expression is among those ground maxims that trigger critical and philosophical discourse. A democratic system of government, which wins popular legitimacy, is expected to lay down solid and systematic foundations with serious political will and practical commitment for the realization of “market place of ideas”. Besides, free and democratic societies, which have constitutionally stipulated rights to freely access, transfer, and choose information with diversity of sources and contents, could naturally have the better chance to pass informed decisions and judgments in cogently defining their destinies. In principle, such a democratic political system, with all its contemporary challenges, does not therefore impose up on individual citizens’ mind public media over private media, domestic media over international as well as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, and development oriented news over diversity of ideas. Though there are varieties of literatures as well as research works conducted in this regard, little has done in critically justifying why such a system authorizes individual human agents to be indispensible and autonomous vetoes to determine the sources and the contents of information. Besides, this work tries to critically explore some of the positive developments and existential challenges posing significant threat to such a democratic value for the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of individual human actors. To this effect, critical evaluation and reflection of the main philosophical assumptions on freedom of information, which in turn enable us to critically assess contemporary problems and opportunities, have been parts of this article. In this regard, however, this work has not been an attempt for generalization on topic raised based on existential situations of individual countries.</p>

<p>Ageing society opens up enormous economic potential. Whereas for a long time social interpretation homed in on the doomsday scenarios of demographic change, it is the economic potential that is now emerging with increasing clarity. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and communication technolog</span>ies stand a good chance of benefiting from this trend. Older people are not intrinsically technology refuseniks, as evidenced by the growing number of silver agers using the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>. Successful products will be far removed from disenfranchisement and stigmatisation. The challenge to product developers and marketing strategists is to create age-appropriate offers that older people do not perceive as encroaching on their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> or pointing up their physical infirmities. Particularly promising are offers enabling barrier-free use without seeming like segregational solutions for specific age groups. User friendliness, value systems and the legal framework are currently stymieing yet wider success. Technical fascination aside, the business potential hinges directly on regulations concerning data protection, teletreatment and cost reimbursement, on user friendliness and society’s attitude towards the application of robotics in medicine and healthcare. The tasks involved are enormous. Product developers, marketing strategists, physicians, nurses and carers, politicians and older people in need of help themselves must be prepared to take the new routes. Assistance systems, e-Health and health games benefit from demographic change. The range of offers is highly diversified. They extend from ‘intelligent’ tablet dispensers, emergency bio sensor technology in motor vehicles and motion sensor technology through tele-monitoring and online consultations to brain jogging and exercise games.</p>

<p>Older individuals frequently experience reversible “frailty syndrome,”, increasing incidence of disability. Although physical exercise interventions may delay functional decline, there are difficulties in implementing them and performing seamless follow-up at home. Very few technological solutions attempt to address this challenge and improve individual participation.Our objectives are to (1) develop a technological solution designed to support active aging of frail older persons, (2) conduct a first laboratory evaluation of the device, and (3) design a multidimensional clinical trial to validate our solution.We conducted a first phase of multidisciplinary meetings to identify real end users and health professional’s unmet needs, and to produce specifications for the architecture of the solution. In a second phase, we performed laboratory tests of the first proposed prototype (a smart insole) with 3 healthy volunteers. We then designed an ongoing clinical trial to finalize the multidimensional evaluation and improvement of the solution.To respond to the needs expressed by the stakeholders (frailty monitoring and adherence improvement), we developed a prototype of smart shoe insole to monitor key parameters of frailty during daily life and promote walking. It is a noninvasive wireless insole, which automatically measures gait parameters and transmits information to a remote terminal via a secure <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> connection. To ensure the solution’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and transparency, we developed an original energy harvesting system, which transforms mechanical energy produced by the user’s walking movement into electrical energy. The first laboratory tests of this technological solution showed good reliability measures and also a good acceptability for the users. We have planned an original iterative medical research protocol to validate our solution in real life.Our smart insole could support preventive strategies against disability in primary care by empowering the older patients without increasing the busy health professional’s workload.Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02316600; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=NCT02316600&amp;Search=Search.

<p>In the digital age, technology is playing an important role in changing the nature of professionalism. Newer forms of professional learning stand in contrast to more traditional forms of professional development. The shifting paradigm has implications for school leaders in all contexts. This study sought to qualitatively examine how a sample of eight school leaders worked to support professional learning in their school communities and leverage tools in areas such as content aggregation, media creation, blogging and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. In one-on-one and focus group interviews, participants discussed how technology is changing professional learning in their context and reflected on how their leadership has evolved in response to perceived challenges. Findings suggest that school leaders are aware of the importance of supporting professional learning through multiple device platforms, online networks and opportunities to play, and experiment with technology.

<p>The article begins from explanation of the meaning (from the point of view of the Orthodox Church) of the word „catholic” as one of the ontological attributes of the Church. Than the author presents the examples of the different kinds of meetings of Church hierarchs on the highest level and its titles/names. Than the article gives a short presentation of the initiative and history of the convene of Pan-Orthodox Council. The idea of that kind of meeting was born in the beginning of XX century on Ecumenical Patriar<span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>e. The preparation to the Pan-Orthodox Council lasts many yearsand contains of many different kind of meetings. Meetings of the special commission that consists of representatives of each Autocephaly Orthodox Church concentrate on the different topics. During last meetings several important topics were discussed, as: Orthodox Diaspora, <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> and the methods of its granting, Autocephaly and the methods of its grantingand Diptychs. The author, who took part in some of these meeting,explains the positions of the various Churches in these matters as well asshares his opinions on them. In conclusion the author presents the opinion that despite many different problems on the way to prepare the Pan-Orthodox Council, this idea can be realized even in the near future.</p>

<p>There is currently an increased interest in the effect of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use in the college student population, a group that may be particularly susceptible to problems related to online use because of the accessibility afforded them on campuses and due to their developmental stage of identity formation. The current study examined the relationship between quan- tity of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use and the common concerns of college students. An online student survey of behavior and concerns was administered to 182 college freshmen. The survey included demographic variables, ratings of satisfaction with various campus experiences, and ratings of level of concerns for 78 problems or issues that are often faced by college students. Freshman students who use the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> for less than 10 hours per week were at least twice as likely as those who do not to report concern over feeling sad or depressed, not knowing how to study effectively, feeling lonely, jug- gling too many roles, and not living up to people’s expectations. Results showed that male students who were online more than 10 hours per week expressed significantly less concern about their emerging role definitions and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Female students who used the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> for more than 10 hours per week reported significantly less concern about being sad or depressed. These results support the hypothesis that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use in college freshmen may represent a successful coping mechanism. This finding is discussed in relation to recent research reports on both detriments and benefits of online use by college students.</p>

<p>Digital equity and intercultural education continue to be areas of concern in the emerging knowledge-based society. The digital divide is present across the globe as the result of a complex of factors such as the inequality in: access to hardware and connectivity; <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of use; digital and literacy skills; availability of technical and social support; and access to educators skilled in the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICTs). Although there is rapid progress in the growth of mobile subscriptions across the globe, there remain groups of digitally excluded peoples within and across countries. Moreover, although progress has been made in addressing connectivity issues and challenges in learning about digital technology, teachers and learners continue to face issues and challenges related to teaching-and-learning with digital technologies and resources within local contexts and beyond. For instance, in an era of rapid global cultural, political, economic and social changes, the need for intercultural education has never been greater. Not only does digital exclusion contribute to a knowledge divide but it also limits opportunities for intercultural connections, communications and understandings. Building on the work of previous EDUsummITs, the EDUsumIT 2013 participants focused on exploring how digital equity and intercultural education are intertwined. This paper describes current needs and challenges as well as opportunities related to digital equity and intercultural education, as well as the increasingly important role technology plays in helping to foster intercultural understanding and education. These are illustrated by examples of how access to digital resources may help bridge both the digital and cultural divides and relate them to some of the recommendations for policy and practice made by the EduSummit 2013 Digital Equity and Intercultural Education Workgroup to help address these needs.</p>

<p>Within the integration of technology into language education, special attention needs to be paid to languages for specific purposes (LSP), drawing on developments in computer-assisted language learning and applied linguistics, on the one hand, and on the pervasive use of technology in academic and professional communication, on the other. From a definition of LSP centered on learner need, specificity of activities and materials, and teacher and learner profiles, this article examines how technology has transformed LSP teaching and learning. Through technology, LSP teachers and researchers can access discipline-specific materials and situations and compile corpora of specialized texts. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Computer-mediated</span> communication provides learning tools and a gateway to the discourse community. Technology also provides opportunities for collaborating, creating virtual environments and online courses, and fostering learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. These applications are examined within the current LSP scenario, paying attention to conditions and challenges for implementation, as well as to the roles of teachers and learners. This article also points to areas that merit further analysis from an LSP perspective, such as the use of different technologies and modes for effective learning, the analysis of specialized texts, and the integration into LSP of emerging technologies that have made their way into social uses.

<p>Through in-depth interviews with Taiwanese newspaper workers, this paper illustrates the “de-skilling” effects of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICTs) on journalists. In recent years, Taiwanese reporters have experienced an increase in workload and an intensification of managerial control due to the introduction of new technologies in the newsroom. Using ICTs in the workplace consequently has harmed journalists’ working conditions and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Moreover, ICTs have led to a trivialization of reporting tasks and devaluation of reporters’ experience and knowledge. The degradation of reporting work resulting from the use of ICTs has enabled managers at Taiwanese newspapers to hire young employees to fill the jobs of experienced reporters and to reduce salary costs.</p>

<p>The current review summarizes the historic memory of the evolution and futurology concerning the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies (ICT) in Colombian Universities. This is in order to make an approach to understand the current state and provide a conceptual input that advices decision making, policies and programs regarding ICTs towards its trends in universities.&nbsp;ICTs mean modernization, quality, productivity, better services and support to educational processes. Therefore, some universities try to be up-to-date because they consider that ICTs gives them the advantage, which is why it is imperative to investigate how this process was faced. This synthesis followed the methodology of the History of Education3 . ICTs were integrated in the Colombian universities mainly in the concepts of teaching and management through university’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, advancing in every context towards an on-line university. Nowadays, the potential and services have become real, there are public policies available and on-line modality is increasing, however the University 2.0 trend must be reached.</p>

<p>Today, the emergence of web-based communities and hosted services such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s, wikis and folksonomies, brings in tremendous freedom of web <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing between users. Along with the interaction between users and computers, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> is rapidly becoming an important part of our digital experience, ranging from digital textual information to diverse multimedia forms. These aspects and characteristics constitute of the core of second generation of web. Social networking (SN) and recommender system (RS) are two hot and popular topics in the current Web 2.0 era, where the former emphasises the generation, dissemination and evolution of user relations, and the latter focuses on the use of collective preferences of users so as to provide the better experience and loyalty of users in various web applications. Leveraging user social connections is able to alleviate the common problems of sparsity and cold-start encountered in RS. This paper aims to summarise the research progresses and findings in these two areas and showcase the empowerment of integrating these two kinds of research strengths.</p>

<p>This study is based on the new educational proposals for the development of skills in young students, one of which is: autonomously. This can be an indicator for continuing education to new social paradigms. The proposed educative management to key competencies and the question is, if the concept is convergent competent educational <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The aim is to explain and propose mechanisms for quality management for construction and educational empowerment of upper secondary students. The methodology consists of a documentary analysis previously reviewing pedagogical trends that have influenced, and a field study, aimed at students: <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> as their interest, skills, comprehensive reform and empowerment based on teachers, school and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>. educational <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> can produce favorable results for the learning and use of knowledge building. You learn by practicing it to allow its development as an ongoing exercise to teach yourself an education according throughout life.</p>

<p>last decade has witnessed a policy shift in the ethics framework surrounding genetic research moving from an emphasis on <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and privacy towards including more communitarian values, such as reciprocity, mutuality, and solidarity.1 Today, the era of open access databases and personal genomics via the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> could again affect this framework. As both longitudinal, populational studies and virtual personal genomics strain the confines of deontological and legal parameters of consent to health privacy, it becomes important to ask: What are the convergent and divergent elements of health privacy in these new contexts? And, is there a need to reconstruct privacy? Historically, the legal and ethical framework surrounding the protection of privacy has been centered on the right of the individual to control and limit the flow of personal information. Indeed, the protection of privacy is traditionally viewed as stemming from a unilateral emphasis on <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> as underscored by article 12 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights: No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or corre-</p>

<p>As of 2015, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> threats have become more prevalent due to high-profile cases like the Target, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Home Depot, and Sony Entertainment breaches. In order to prevent what former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta characterized as a “<span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span> Pearl Harbor,” the US government has to engage the private sector in order to build a solid public-private partnership (PPP) for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security. For there to be a successful <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security PPP between the US government and the private sector, there must be a PPP founded on a model composed of four essential elements: a high level of trust between the public and private entities that corresponds to a mutual belief in the positive gains of both partners; clear baseline guidance imposed from legislation, which should be reinforced with government training and financial incentives; a bottom-up structural approach for efficient operations that allows for more <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> at lower levels on local needs and resources; and, gaining influential community involvement in the formation of PPPs from all levels of the participating organizations, as well as civil leadership and the general public.

<p>Abstract ‘The art of living with ICTs (<span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies)’ today not only means finding new ways to cope, interact and create new lifestyles on the basis of the new digital (network) technologies individually , as ‘consumer-citizens’. It also means inventing new modes of living, producing and, not in the least place, struggling collectively , as workers and producers. As the so-called digital revolution unfolds in the context of a neoliberal cognitive and consumerist capitalism, its ‘innovations’ are predominantly employed to modulate and control both production processes and consumer behavior in view of the overall goal of extracting surplus value. Today, the digital networks overwhelmingly destroy social <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, instead engendering increasing social heteronomy and proletarianization. Yet it is these very networks themselves, as technical pharmaka in the sense of French ‘technophilosopher’ Bernard Stiegler, that can be employed as no other to struggle against this tendency. This paper briefly explores this possibility by reflecting upon current diagnoses of our ‘technological situation’ by some exemplary post-operaist Marxists from a Stieglerian, pharmacological perspective.</p>

<p>Established firms often create new business divisions in response to new ways of competing, such as those based on disruptive innovations. Using a sample of daily newspapers and their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> divisions, this study examines the corporate characteristics of orientation, attention, and control and venture management team characteristics of vision, experience, and collective efficacy and their interactive effects on the overall performance of the new division. Findings demonstrate that vision and collective efficacy are related to venture outcomes, orientation affects the experience and vision to venture performance relationships, attention enhances the vision and collective efficacy to performance relationships, and decision <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> influences the experience and collective efficacy to venture performance relationships. Overall, the results of this study imply that specific venture management team characteristics and corporate characteristics may be tailored to improve chances of meeting specific performance targets and achieving overall venture success.</p>

<p>Ecological view of human development calls for an investigation of multiple contexts surrounding children. In South Korea, traditional Confucianism and recent technological advancements serve as influential social and cultural contexts that affect parent–child relations and child development. High levels of parental control and strong emphasis on academic achievement have long been distinctive features of Korean parenting practices, which are attributable to Confucian values. Additionally, Korean children’s <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> dependency (MPD) has become a growing concern, as South Korea developed as an IT powerhouse. Combined, these contexts resulted in high parental control of children’s <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> use, so that such electronic devices would not hinder learning and achievement. Effects of high parental control on children’s MPD and their school life, however, have yet to be discovered. We hypothesized, that, unlike parents’ intentions, psychological control is more likely to increase MPD and disrupt school life. To examine this research model, we made use of the first and third wave data from Korea Children and Youth Panel Survey. Participants were 2378 children (52.2&nbsp;% boys) of the same age of 10 in the first wave. After multiple imputation for missing values, hierarchical logistic regression followed to examine the mediational model. The results verified the hypothesized model, showing significant adverse influence of psychological control on MPD, self-regulated learning and school adjustment. MPD fully mediated the effect of psychological control on self-regulations, while partially mediating the effects on school adjustment. Implications for Korean parents with regard to supporting children’s psychological <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> was discussed.</p>

<p>Technology-based approaches for the prevention of depression offer considerable benefits including easy access, patient <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and nonconsumable services that are autonomous from traditional (face-to-face) interventions. The authors have previously worked to develop <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> interventions based on the frameworks for conventional, face-to-face effective community-based interventions, and propose to integrate these models into a vaccine aptly applicable to technology-based delivery. This article reviews the literature on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>-based depression prevention programs using this behavioral vaccine development model, reviewing literature relevant to each component of the model in turn.</p>

<p>Recently we have seen a shift of focus in using the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> from often inappropriate human-computer interactivity to human-human interaction, based on collaborative learning concepts like learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and tandem learning. The renewed discussion of interface design has provoked a reconsideration of me traditional graphical user interface and a shift towards more intuitive interfaces like virtual reality, mainly building on the concept of constructionism. The MOO (multi-user domain, object oriented) system provides a flexible, easy-to-use multiple user virtual reality that allows for the integration of language learning tools and resources in a common environment, a third place.</p>
