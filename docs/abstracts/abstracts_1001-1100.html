<p>This study was aimed to investigate the beliefs of EFL prospective teacher educators towards the use of WhatsApp in English learning and teaching. This study used survey research design and the samples were 44 master students of Applied Linguistics Department who had academic degree of B.Ed in TEFL in one of state universities in Yogyakarta. This study found that EFL prospective teacher educators had favorable beliefs towards WhatsApp integration in English learning and teaching. They perceived true that the use of WhatsApp was sine qua non of increasing the learners’ English learning proficiency, motivation, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and language attitude and creating fun and enjoyable English learning atmosphere. Consequently, present English teachers should integrate WhatsApp <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> application in English learning and teaching.</p>

<p>The spread of crisis pregnancy centers (CPCs) has become an alarming issue in the fields of public health and reproductive justice (RJ) as they impede women&amp;rsquo;s fully-informed decisions and threaten women&amp;rsquo;s reproductive <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. However, most existing scholarship has only focused on CPCs within the United States; hardly any literature has been devoted to anti-CPC activism. This study contributes to addressing these gaps by adopting a mixed method. The paper first reviews the status quo of U.S. and Canadian CPCs through the existing literature to contextualize my investigation. Then it explores the establishment of individual Canadian CPCs to evaluate whether they are gaining more influence. It also analyzes the presence and absence of information on Canadian anti-CPC activism in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> of RJ organizations. Finally, it examines the interviews I conducted with Canadian RJ activists to identify the ongoing anti-CPC activism and why some groups do not regard it central to their agenda. Results of this research reveal that CPCs have been continuously expanding in Canada during the past 35 years. Despite realizing their threat, most Canadian RJ groups do not focus their activism on CPCs and instead, concern themselves more with such issues as abortion access owing to their political engagement restriction, as well as their viewpoint that variation among Canadian CPCs and the Canadian liberal political context lessen CPCs&amp;rsquo; overall threat. The limited ongoing activism includes lobbying for halting funding for CPCs, revoking their charitable statuses, banning their advertisements, and removing their biased sex education from public schools.</p>

<p>Abstract The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> has had a tremendous impact on our routine life. Recent developments in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things (IoT) technology have brought several issues to fore. IoT is a new emerging technology in which the electronic devices communicate through the medium of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> for remote sensing and control. IoT is not a single technology; rather it is the convergence of heterogeneous technologies pertaining to different engineering domains. Prominent technologies include Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID), Networking and Communication, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Real-Time Systems (RTS), Cloud computing, etc. In establishing communication between devices, IoT exposes to many challenges on account of the diversity of devices, energy, and power constraints, noise, and interference, stringent requirement of timeliness, etc. Though several researchers have attempted addressing these challenges in IoT, more research is still required for the complete transition from <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> protocol version 4 (IPv4), developed in 1981 to IPv6, developed in 2008. Researchers need to focus on increasing the address space to cater to unlimited things on our planet, evolving set of standards for uniformity and developing new energy sources for powering every single sensor. Till date, research has focused on evolving design strategies for energy <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in electronic devices deployed in IoT, so as to enable self-powering of a device, in absence of DC supply. Present work reviews research on implementable methods of energy <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, reported in the recent literature (during 2010 to 2018), so as to identify immediate issues to be addressed and new directions to be explored for enhancing energy <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of devices deployed in IoT. The conclusions of the work will be useful for researchers engaged with addressing issues in energy optimization in various domains of IoT. Also, the conclusions will be of interest to business personnel, sponsoring government agencies, agencies for standardization of performance and academicians engaged in the development of IoT.</p>

<p>Higher education institutions at the international level have seen the need to adopt and integrate <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies to meet the opportunities and challenges of innovation in teaching and learning processes. This logic has led to the implementation of virtual learning environments called ‘Learning Management Systems’, the functionalities of which support flexible and active learning under a constructivist approach. This study measured didactic and technological use of Moodle and its implications in teaching from a quantitative approach by administering a questionnaire to a sample of 640 higher education teachers. Some guiding questions were as follows: Are teachers using the Moodle platform for didactic purposes? What strategies, resources and tools are teachers using, and what do they contribute to student-centred teaching? Are teaching strategies that are focused on collaboration, interaction and student <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> promoted? The results coincide with those of other studies, confirming an instrumental and functional use of the platform, which is mainly being used as a repository for materials and information, while its pedagogical use remains limited. This is becoming a problem in higher education institutions, something that requires debate and reflection from a systemic perspective on the adoption and integration of technology in the classroom.</p>

<p>The purpose of this paper is to analyze the relationship between researchers’ <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> (SM) behavior and their academic performance.,A sample of 362 researchers was recruited from the colleges of management of 52 Chinese universities. A factor analysis of eight indices retrieved from the 362 data items was conducted. A total of 24 Chinese researchers were interviewed and given a robust test.,The results indicate that Chinese general <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> (GSM) is insufficient to support academic research and it is difficult for scholars to enhance the visibility of their academic performance using GSM platforms, which can actually induce addiction. University resources, management systems, and working environment affect how scholars apply SM.,The authors examined the researchers’ SM behavior by giving them a questionnaire and interview; however, this approach proved inadequate. The academic performance of researchers is affected by numerous factors, but the authors only considered SM behavior.,It is suggested that universities apply academic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> (ASM) indicators to measure researchers’ contributions so that they self-regulate their SM usage attitudes. Also, universities should also promote ASM platforms.,This study analyzed scholars’ GSM usage and academic performance, and the moderating effect of university level on the relationship between need for competence and relatedness and need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. This comprehensive analysis contributes to the scholarly SM usage literature.</p>

<p>The prominence of information and communications technology (ICTs) in defining India’s media modernity can be gauged by the growing reach of online <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> as well as continuing expansion of digital media channels and satellite broadcasting even in the early 21stCentury. Policies concerning information technologies, from telegraph to satellite networks, have also been central to media politics and with the rise of new media, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> related policies have similarly become pivotal to the interaction between the state and media system. Drawing from a comparative media system perspective, this paper argues that while there has been no major constitutional or legal overhaul, as yet, new ideas and information technology policy activism are reshaping the contours of state action and ‘<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>’ of the press in India’s democracy. Comparing technology debates in an earlier era, when satellite networks swept across the media system, with the more recent deliberations around liabilities for digital intermediaries, the paper unpacks the nature of change and locates its origins in the revival of discursive institutions (Schmidt 2002, 2008) of technology policy since the early 2000s. Technology related ideas, I argue, now serve as institutions, able to function as a ‘coordinating discourse’ (ibid) that have revived ideals of an autonomous media. Technology inflected ideals of ‘anonymity’ also counter the ‘communicative discourse’ (ibid) of Hindutva and cultural nationalist politics of media which framed the issue of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the ascendant phase of print and electronic media capitalism until the 1990s.</p>

<p>Despite the many transformations in aesthetics and technologies that fashion photography has undergone since its spread as an influential cultural form in the early twentieth century, one constant has always held fast: that the imagery depicts a fashionable ideal. The look of the fashionable ideal is, of course, ever subject to change. However, there are qualities that are always present: the body is subject to the authority of fashion, limitations to the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the body such as gravity or ageing are absent, and the figure is imbued with possibility and mutability, even as it freezes a momentary state of perfection.</p>
<p>These qualities become particularly marked in the present era, in which digital influencers simultaneously assume the roles of cultural producer, model and consumer while implicitly embodying the fashionable ideal. At the moment of their publication, the labor of producing these images seems to evaporate, as bodies with no material limitation are presented with immediacy, and figure, commodity and surrounds collapse into one.</p>
<p>This article interrogates how we can conceive of the labor of appearance and being in the fashion image, and considers how this style of fashion imagery draws on visual rhetoric of prior eras of fashion photography and is structured by the existing power relations of capitalism and the human and non-human actors of media technologies. In so doing, the concept of the fashionable ideal is explored in one of its contemporary iterations as fluid, aspirational, global, simultaneously embodied and disembodied.</p>

<p>Nowadays, the rapid development of information technology has increasingly penetrated into all walks of society and even people’s lives. With the development of education informatization, traditional teaching can’t meet the needs of talents in the new era. Developing a new teaching mode by integrating <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>, big data and traditional teaching has become the main theme of contemporary education. This paper studies the connotation of educational informatization and Blended Teaching theory and puts forward the Blended Teaching mode of College English by improving teachers’ informationized teaching ability, constructing the diversified teaching platform, and setting up informationized teaching resource base, adopting different teaching methods and strategies, so as to improve students’ enthusiasm and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in College English learning and enhance the effect of College English teaching.</p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the form of different machine learning models is applied to Big Data as a way to turn data into valuable knowledge. The rhetoric is that ensuing predictions work well—with a high degree of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and automation. We argue that we need to analyze the process of applying machine learning in depth and highlight at what point human knowledge production takes place in seemingly autonomous work. This article reintroduces classification theory as an important framework for understanding such seemingly invisible knowledge production in the machine learning development and design processes. We suggest a framework for studying such classification closely tied to different steps in the work process and exemplify the framework on two experiments with machine learning applied to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> data from one of our labs. By doing so we demonstrate ways in which classification and potential discrimination take place in even seemingly unsupervised and autonomous models. Moving away from concepts of non-supervision and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> enable us to understand the underlying classificatory dispositifs in the work process and that this form of analysis constitutes a first step towards governance of artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Abstract Most <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-physical human systems (CPHS) rely on users learning how to interact with the system. Rather, a collaborative CPHS should learn from the user and adapt to them in a way that improves holistic system performance. Accomplishing this requires collaboration between the human-robot/human-computer interaction and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-physical system communities in order to feed back knowledge about users into the design of the CPHS. The requisite user studies, however, are difficult, time consuming, and must be carefully designed. Furthermore, as humans are complex in their interactions with <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> it is difficult to know, a priori, how many users must participate to attain conclusive results. In this paper we elaborate on our work to infer intrinsic user qualities through human-robot interactions correlated with robot performance in order to adapt the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and improve holistic CPHS performance. We first demonstrate through a study that this idea is feasible. Next, we demonstrate that significant differences between groups of users can impact conclusions particularly where different autonomies are involved. Finally, we also provide our rich, extensive corpus of user study data to the wider community to aid researchers in designing better CPHS.</p>

<p>The Spanish Constitution of 1978 has not only created a parliamentary government under a constitutional monarchy, but also enabled a decentralized structure which opened the way for developing co-existence mechanisms for different nationalities and ethnic groups, inhabiting 17 autonomous communities and 2 autonomous cities, varying in their degree of identification with the vision of one common Spanish state. It seems that it has not been expected, that at least one of these regions will demonstrate such strong sense of identity that it will not only demand broader <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, but also full independence. Can <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and Google tools help in achieving this goal? Will it be possible to use them to build support for Catalan activities among the international community? And finally&nbsp;– will data obtained thanks to Google enable to forecast future political events? The Author is looking for answers to these questions by analyzing data obtained during research conducted in the network, as well as information gathered while conducting interviews with Catalan politicians in the moment of region’s fight for independence.</p>

<p>Abstract While the increasing average age of population is posing new challenges to societies and healthcare systems, the emergence of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things research area is generating the hope for automated assisted environments, which could combine the advances in sensors networks with that of runtime monitoring systems, in order to create smart houses able to take care of their older inhabitants and delay the recourse to hospitals and nursing homes. However, although various assisted living systems have been proposed in the last decade, the goal of realizing an effective domestic support system for elderly is still far from reached. In this work, we present a project aiming to re-engineer a set of everyday life objects, equipping them with environmental and wearable sensors, thus to monitor the condition of older people in their domestic residences and provide security while preserving the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and independence of the subjects. The main focus of the paper at hand is on the requirements and solutions implemented to realize the backbone infrastructure of such system as regards both the adopted semantic message routing mechanism and the newly conceived approach to event analysis, which combines Complex Event Processing and a reactive implementation of Event Calculus.</p>

<p>This reflection article discusses in a broader way the results of a research carried out by the authors that sought to find the relationship between family variables and variables of addiction in university students, such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction and the consumption of alcoholic beverages and psychoactive drugs. In the research, only a relationship was found with the presence of siblings and family typology, for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction. There was a broad search for references that, in general, confirm the relationship between family variables and addictive variables for Young students of secondary schools, but not for university students. As a result of this review, we hypothesize that, for young university students, family variables lose their importance in favor of other variables such as networks of friends, features of the young person at this stage of his or her development characterized by the search for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and differentiation, and even residential independence from the family. Finally, this background course allows us to state that addictive behavior is determined by individual and contextual factors that require a complex systemic approach and a perspective focused on coping strategies and resilient capacity, as personal variables.</p>

<p>This paper presents the result of the pilot project of an out-of-class; it is the making of a news program with 20-25 minutes duration. The pilot project took place at UIN Malulana Malik Ibrahim Malang; it was conducted benefitted from the familiarity of the young people toward <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. The aims of this task were to promote the students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> learning by giving them the opportunities to practice their speaking skill, building up their self-confidence, and challenging their creativity. Therefore, the questionnaire, as the self-reflection feedback, consisted of three questions; whether the making of news program gives them the opportunities to practice their speaking skill, builds up their confidence, and challenges their creativity. There were 30 students involved in this pilot project. The result of data analysis showed that most of the participants strongly agreed the making a new program give them a chance to practice their speaking skill, build up their self-confidence, and challenge their creativity. Therefore, making a news program can be an out-of-speaking class activity in order to promote the students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> learning.</p>

<p>The transhumanism is an international movement that states that adding technological implants and inserting DNA will improve the human being. However, the transhumanists hide two subjects: the use of technological implants as a weapon against the citizen and the method they are developing their dangerous projects with, which is suspected to be illicit human experiments in the world. Technological implants like brain nanobots might cause losing mind control and thus, the carriers can be controlled by others and lose their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, they can be spied permanently with the cerebral <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and can lose their privacy their memory can be deleted and can loose their identity. Thus, the humans who carry technological implants can be permanently spied on, mentally controlled and they lose their identity, becoming a human slave at the service of the transnational companies and the economic powers. An objective analysis reveals that transhumanism is only an intellectual swindle that leads to digital fascism, a society where a millionaire elite will govern citizens with technological implants, who will be digital slaves at the service of an oligarchy.</p>

<p>Professional <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> has come under greater scrutiny due to managerialism, consumerism, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICT), and the changing composition of professions themselves. This scrutiny is often portrayed as a tension between professional and managerial logics. Recently, medical <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> has increasingly been shaped in terms of transparency, where publication of clinical performance (via ICT) might be a more pervasive form of surveillance. Such transparency may have the potential for a more explicit managerial logic but is contested by clinicians. This paper applies notions of surveillance to public reporting of cardiac surgery, involving the online publication of mortality rates of named surgeons. It draws on qualitative data from a case-study of cardiac surgeons in one hospital, incorporating interviews with health care managers and national policymakers in England. We examine how managerial logics are mediated by professional <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, generating patterns of enrolment, resistance and reactivity to public reporting. The managerial ‘gaze’ of public reporting is becoming widespread but the surgical specialty is accommodating it, leading to a re-assertion of knowledge, based on professional definitions. The paper assesses whether this form of surveillance is challenging to or being assimilated by the medical profession, thereby recasting the profession itself.</p>

<p>Recent developments in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y have led to renewed interest in the impact of flexible work on work-related outcomes such as job satisfaction, organizational identification and work engagement. Although there is a vast amount of literature indicating the positive association between job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and work-related outcomes, there has been little discussion about the contextual conditions that strengthen this relationship. This paper analyzes the role of perceived organizational alignment as a conditional factor and shows that <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> alone cannot explain an organization’s success in improving work-related outcomes. An analysis of online survey from 481 employees shows that the perceived organizational alignment moderates the positive effect of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> on work-related outcomes in the context of flexible work. For employees who perceive organizational alignment to be high, the positive relationships are strengthened for work engagement and organizational identification, but attenuated for job satisfaction. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.</p>

<p>Abstract We develop a mediation model to explain the relationship between attachment and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social Networking Site</span> (SNS) addiction. Drawing upon the Needs-Affordances-Features model, we investigate the mediating role of satisfaction of the innate psychological needs that are salient in the SNS context (i.e., need for relatedness, need for self-presentation, and need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>). Based on an empirical study of 314 daily <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> users, results reveal distinct effects of attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance on SNS addiction through the satisfaction of different psychological needs. Satisfaction of the need for relatedness and the need for self-presentation mediates the positive relationship between attachment anxiety and SNS addiction. Satisfaction of these needs also mediates the negative relationship between attachment avoidance and SNS addiction. Satisfaction of the need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> mediates the positive relationship between attachment avoidance and SNS addiction. We conclude the study with the implications for research and practice.</p>

<p>This paper examines the influences of professional development activities on important teacher-level factors that are important for the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>y (ICT) in education for primary school teachers in Mongolia. The study utilizes the survey data collected in 2012 (n = 826) and 2016 (n = 1161) to identify the changes in factors that are important to the use of ICT in education. The study result shows that six teacher level factors that are important for the ICT integration have been improved over time through professional development activities. These are professional competency in educational use of ICT, collaboration for ICT integration, benefits on use of ICT, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to innovate, recognition as a professional, and skills and practices in educational use of ICT. This provides supporting evidence to educational practitioners for the implementation of effective professional development programs to promote ICT integration in education, especially in the developing country’s context.</p>

<p>Health and human services professionals are increasingly using mobile devices to support clinical decision-making and evidence-based practice. However, research on self-directed learning in an era of growing digital technology utilization is underdeveloped. This study explored the adoption and use of mobile learning as a continuing professional development (CPD) activity.A mixed-methods case study using semistructured interviews and a web-based questionnaire was conducted with health and human services professionals in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada.Respondents reported using a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> (53.8%), tablets (50.4%), YouTube (43.0%), and mobile apps (35.8%) for CPD. The highest-rated benefits of mobile learning included improved access to information (M = 3.51); potential for enhanced knowledge acquisition (M = 3.45); staying up to date (M = 3.44); and verifying information (M = 3.40). The greatest barriers included cost of some apps and resources (M = 3.07); websites/programs not functional on mobile devices (M = 2.84); workplace barriers preventing access to digital resources (M = 2.82); and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use linked to negative perceptions of professionalism (M = 2.65). Interview respondents described the flexibility and convenience of mobile learning, the level of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> it offered, and the advantages of learning on their own time. Technical issues, particularly for rural and remote practitioners, and digital professionalism also emerged as potential barriers.A systems model organizes the factors influencing the adoption and use of mobile devices and resources to support “just-in-time” learning. Addressing policies, practices, and regulations that enable or inhibit adoption of mobile learning for CPD may foster enhanced use to support better clinical decision-making, improved accuracy, and greater patient safety.</p>

<p>Abstract A growing body of research has examined the relations of dispositions toward <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) to science achievement among adolescent students. However, there is little research exploring the associations between ICT-related dispositions and science-related dispositions among adolescent students. Therefore, this study, employing a self-determination theory perspective, investigated the relationships of perceived competence in ICT usage and perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> related to ICT usage with dispositions toward science—enjoyment of science, interest in broad science topics, science self-efficacy, and epistemological beliefs about science—among 258,192 adolescent students from 10,767 schools in 42 PISA 2015 participating countries. Results of multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) analyses, after accounting for student-, school-, and country-level demographic characteristics, indicated that students’ perceived competence in ICT usage and perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> related to ICT usage were significantly positively related to their enjoyment of science, interest in broad science topics, science self-efficacy, and epistemological beliefs about science. Further, the results of the study revealed that students’ perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> related to ICT usage was more strongly associated with their dispositions toward science than perceived competence in ICT usage. Implications of the findings for policy and practice are discussed.</p>

<p>The current article addresses the issue of how to design for meaningful experiences of wellbeing and social inclusion, supported by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y, among older adults. This is done with regard to a background study conducted for the purpose of collecting end user needs in order to inform design choices. Our design approach is influenced by the theory of Experience Design, in which design should be aimed at creating specific experiences. These experiences are considered to derive from a limited number of fundamental human needs. The study is framed as design research using the methodology of user-centred design as a guide for the creative process. Semi-structured focus group interviews were conducted with 25 older adults, identifying needs of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, relatedness, physical thriving, security, pleasure and stimulation. Design goals were set based on these needs and three interventions were designed and implemented accordingly.</p>

<p>Online education is a network-based approach to teaching. It is a method of content dissemination and rapid learning through the application of UGC and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> technology.Compared with traditional school education, online learning can obtain more resources, more <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and no longer limited time and space for learning.Through the questionnaire, this paper finds that learners in the online education model still have some shortcomings in the learning process.For example, the learning process is not durable.Therefore, this paper uses neural network classification algorithm to analyze the related factors that affect the learning behavior of online education students.And propose corresponding control strategies for different influencing factors.By constructing a learning process control strategy model for large educational data, to help learners improve their learning efficiency, help the online education model break through the bottleneck, the online education industry has maintained rapid development.Finally, through the comparative analysis of the improved online education model and the traditional online education model, finding an improved online education model can better improve students’ interest in learning.Provided a reference for the development of online education,It also provides a reference for the transformation and upgrading of traditional education to online education.</p>

This article sets out to show that limits, norms, rules, and even physical limitations are fundamental in education because they are an essential part of human reality and the human condition. Its main thesis is that rules not only regulate human activities from outside, but they also operate from the root of the activity itself as an expression of the peculiar rationality of human beings and their way of being in the world. The article firstly demonstrates this thesis by examining certain physical limitations that are approached educationally, and then in various other human areas, such as language, play, ecology, the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, and sexuality. It also shows how rules, by limiting the possibilities for how certain actions will develop, allow us to intuit or glimpse other types of limits and other possibilities —not always better ones— for human development and its standards. From an anthropological perspective, this has led us to suggest how an individual’s future possibilities expand, increase, and develop if her family, school and social settings for growth are spaces bounded by limits and norms. These allow her to feel safe enough to begin a process of critical assimilation of her received inheritance. The subject better understands reality, and the different possibilities for evaluating that reality, when the process of evaluation starts from a relatively enclosed perspective (with limits and norms) on the received tradition.</p>

<p>A critical demand for innovation in elderly care, especially in delivering the quality of service to elderlies, arises as many parts of the world are rapidly in transition to an elderly society. The advancement of robotic technologies, especially, in cognitive robotics and sociable human-robot interaction offers a great opportunity for meeting such demand. This paper presents the design and implementation of a next generation of elderly care robot, named as “HomeMate,” based on an innovative undertaking in its sociability and dependability with extensive user studies. The elderlies taken care of by Senior Welfare Centers are chosen as the target sector, for which the following five service scenarios are designed: infotainment, video <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>ting, game playing, medicine alarm and, in particular, errand services. Unlike conventional approaches, the scenarios are designed here to ensure the overall quality of service by maximizing the synergy under an elderly-caregiver-service robot ecosystem. The unique features implemented in HomeMate include 1) the principle of affordance in appearance design by matching functionality and anthropomorphism indices, 2) the sociability implemented by balancing between <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and user controllability as well as by integrating multimodal interactions into HomeMate avatar, and 3) the emphasis on dependability to inspire confidence on HomeMate as a trusted assistant, for which the principle of dependability is proposed and implemented with a cognitive framework. Experiments and user studies strongly support the proposed design principles and verify the dependability in performance.</p>

<p>Abstract Applying psychological reactance theory (PRT) as a theoretical framework, this study investigates reactance-related factors to better understand why consumers avoid advertising on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>. An online survey was conducted to develop and empirically test a conceptual model that integrates the antecedents and outcomes of reactance against <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> newsfeed ads. Specifically, the study employs <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> users’ perceptions of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, freedom threat, and intrusiveness as antecedents of reactance and measures two sub-constructs of reactance: negative cognitions and anger. As the outcomes of reactance, two types of ad avoidance are examined: cognitive and behavioral. The major findings reveal that users’ perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> decreases their perceptions of ad intrusiveness. Subsequently, ad intrusiveness and freedom threat to use <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> have a positive effect on reactance, which influences ad avoidance. Theoretical and managerial implications are also discussed.</p>

<p>While many <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> users experience social pressure to be available, only some perceive this as a burden. It was hypothesized that this form of social pressure is especially detrimental when it reduces self-control and hinders need satisfaction. Study 1 experimentally tested whether the fulfillment of intrinsic needs (i.e., <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness) in mobile communication mediates these associations. Results show that social pressure negatively affected <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and competence, but did not influence relatedness. Repeated-measures data from Study 2 suggest that social pressure leads to self-control failure, which is associated with reduced competence. This research is the first to develop and test a theoretical model of the effects of social pressure to be available on self-control, need satisfaction, and individuals’ well-being.</p>

<p>The present study investigates some factors affecting college students’ tendency to use <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> for different educational purposes. We reached 120 participants who were college students. Our sample comprised of 63 (52.5%) females and 57 (47.5%) males. We applied convenience sampling technique and an online questionnaire to collect data. Descriptive statistics, multiple regression analysis, and Structural Equation Modelling using IBM SPSS AMOS were utilized. The findings provide that GPA, Personal Use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> for Studying and Socialization, <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> Psychological Need, and Academic Procrastination foresee college students’ willingness to use <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> in their courses.

<p>Previous studies suggest that older adults are living increasingly alone and without the company of their close relatives, which cause them depression problems and a detriment to their health and general wellbeing. The use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social network site</span>s (SNS) allows them to reduce their isolation, improve their social participation, and increase their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Although the adoption of various information technologies by older adults has been studied, some assumptions still predominate, for example, that older adults use SNS only for utilitarian purposes. However, considering SNS as hedonic information systems, and in order to extend the theoretical explanation of the intention to use hedonic systems to their actual use, this study aims to determine the influence of perceived enjoyment, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use on the use of SNS by elders in Concepción, Chile. Two hundred fifty-three older adults participated in the cross-sectional study. The results indicate that perceived ease of use is the variable that has the greatest total effect in explaining the use of SNS and that by adding the perceived enjoyment construct, the explanatory power of the model increases significantly. Therefore, advancement in user acceptance models, especially in the use of SNS by elders, can be made by focusing on the type of system, hedonic or utilitarian.</p>

<p>The present study investigated the factor structure of and measurement invariance in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) engagement construct, and the relationship between ICT engagement and students’ performance on science, mathematics and reading in China and Germany. Samples were derived from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2015 survey. Configural, metric and scalar equivalence were found in a multigroup exploratory structural equation model. In the regression model, a significantly positive association between interest in ICT and student achievement was found in China, in contrast to a significantly negative association in Germany. All achievement scores were negatively and significantly correlated with perceived ICT competence scores in China, whereas science and mathematics achievement scores were not predicted by scores on ICT competence in Germany. Similar patterns were found in China and Germany in terms of perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in using ICT and social relatedness in using ICT to predict students’ achievement. The implications of all the findings were discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;The present work presents an example of using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Computer-Mediated</span> Communication (CMC) in Foreign Language Teaching (FLT) with the aim to increase students’ hours of exposure to English as a Foreign Language (EFL). Since class time is sometimes limited, it is necessary to look for reinforcement tasks for students to properly develop literacy and communication skills. In addition, CMC is considered by scholars a new variety of language, with its own features and rules, one that students must master as well as other traditional language varieties. As secondary goals, this project intended to develop students’ motivation, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, linguistic awareness and cooperative learning. By using a Mobile <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Instant Mess</span>aging (MIM) application, Remind, students were encouraged to communicate in groups and, thereby, supplement hours of practicing the foreign language outside the classroom, without limitation of time and space. Students evaluated the task by means of an online questionnaire and results proved to be positive, showing that they enjoyed the activity and considered it useful and effective. Moreover, they realised the importance of cooperative learning, of responsibility and of being aware of their own learning process. Likewise, the real and authentic purpose of communication enhanced motivation among students.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>The prevalence of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying among adolescents is globally on the rise. This study examined how general and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-specific parenting styles impact the prevalence of young adolescents’ involvement in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying as victims and/or perpetrators.One hundred and eighty 7th and 8th-grade Israeli students participated (Mean age = 13.25, SD = 0.81; 86 males, 89 females, 5 did not indicate gender). Adolescents reported the frequency of their involvement in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying, and whether their parents were using “<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive” or “psychologically controlling” strategies generally and specifically when mediating <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> use.A controlling parenting-style as well as an inconsistent <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>-mediation style were associated with a higher prevalence of adolescent involvement in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>bullying as victims and as perpetrators. Prevalence was higher when parents who generally use a controlling style were less controlling or consistent when mediating <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> use.Despite the caveats related to parental control, parents who generally use a controlling style should consistently use this style while mediating <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>. Inconsistent parenting style conveys messages concerning <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> activities that contradict what teens are accustomed to receiving in other contexts. This inconsistency may encourage them to exploit their relative freedom in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> context and act irresponsibly.</p>

Key attributes that influence improved cultural awareness in social work students are detailed, including the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> prior to, during and after travel abroad. Undergraduate social work students (n=8) participated in a summer course including travel to Costa Rica. Description of the teaching techniques and strategies are described pre-travel, in-country and post-travel. Two measures are described given to students pre-travel and post-travel to assess cultural flexibility, adaptability, openness and personal <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. These include the Cross Cultural Adaptability Inventory (CCAI) and the Short Term Study Abroad Survey. Results included all of the students reporting a change in their world view, attitude changes as a result of in- home stays, and agency visits. There was a significant difference on the CCAI on the Personal <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> subscale.</p>

<p>Teachers have a central role in fostering learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and their views regarding LA are essential. They should maintain the learning environment and activities to support LA. This research aimed to find out teachersâ€™ attitudes towards their roles and learning practices to support LA. A questionnaire was administered to 19 teachers who are studying for a Masters degree at UPI. It is found that teachers rated their responsibilities in choosing classroom activities and evaluating studentsâ€™ progress at the highest point. However, they viewed studentsâ€™ decision making abilities in choosing learning objectives and evaluating their learning at the lowest score. Furthermore, the activities which teachers often recommended to are listen to English songs, read books and use the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>. It can be concluded that teachers have a strong belief towards their roles in LA. Even though they are already conscious about the importance of LA, it should be implemented into practice.</p>

<p>The use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y greatly improved foreign languages teaching and learning. Learning management systems, such as Moodle, used to create and deliver courses, facilitate e-learning in different types of educational institutions. Blended learning as a combination of face-to face and e-learning is conducive to deep learning. We designed a new course “Teaching English as a foreign language to learners with special educational needs” to provide students enrolled in a master’s programme – pre-service English teachers, with an opportunity to enhance their language and professional skills as well as to develop their learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> through meaningful learning experiences blending learning can supplement. We considered micro, meso and macro levels of the course implementation and functioning. In this paper we describe the context in which the course is introduced by providing information about the setting, the curriculum, the need for including this course in the master’s programme at the faculty of foreign languages. We also outline the way the course is designed, including its structure, particular tasks and assessment procedures and present students’ feedback about the impact of the course on their foreign language skills and learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The results indicate that blended learning is an effective tool for development of pre-service teachers’ English language skills and learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The findings of the study can be applied by faculty and administrators involved in the design of courses at tertiary level.</p>

The purpose of this paper is to provide an outline of how core values of the health systems, such as the principles of biomedical ethics, are in a supportive or conflicting relation to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security.,This paper claims that it is possible to map the desiderata relevant to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security onto the four principles of medical ethics, i.e.&nbsp;beneficence, non-maleficence, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and justice, and explore value conflicts in that way.,With respect to the question of how these principles should be balanced, there are reasons to think that the priority of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> relative to beneficence and non-maleficence in contemporary medical ethics could be extended to value conflicts in health-related <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security.,However, the tension between <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and justice, which relates to the desideratum of usability of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y systems, cannot be ignored even if one assumes that respect for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> should take priority over other moral concerns.,In terms of value conflicts, most discussions in healthcare deal with the conflict of balancing efficiency and privacy given the sensible nature of health information. In this paper, the authors provide a broader and more detailed outline.</p>

<p>This article reflects on the insights of higher education teachers about the role that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICT) can have in enhancing students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the teaching and learning process. In order to accomplish this goal, it was necessary to build a theoretical framework that explored the context of higher education under the assumptions of the Bologna process and educative policies, exploring the encouragement to students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and the use of ICT in the teaching and learning process. A quantitative exploratory approach was adopted with the purpose of collecting the insights of teachers involved in two courses of the Portuguese public higher education. The data collection was made through the curricular plans and though a survey to the teachers. With this research, we conclude that teachers reveal efforts to enhance students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and feel motivated to use ICT in their educational practices. The most frequently mentioned motivations are that ICT facilitates the access to resources and information, innovates their practice, improves the regulation, tutoring and intervention, and in interaction and communication. Teachers also appear to hold positive perceptions on the potential of ICT to support their teaching and learning process, especially the perception of utility and ease of use of ICT.</p>

<p>Over the past two decades, there has been growing awareness of and critical interest in the convergence of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies and automobiles. Writing in 2004, Mike Featherstone suggests that the “automobile becomes a new form of communications platform with a complex set of possibilities.” In this article, we argue that the notion of the car as a communication platform continues to form a productive way of thinking about autonomous vehicles. The argument we develop is that the dual roles of data acquisition and management, and local processing are integral to any understanding of the contemporary autonomous vehicle’s “machinic complex.” Both of these things are strongly associated with <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and the transformation of cars into decision-making machines. We use the example of mapping to argue that these capacities are not unique to the emerging technologies of autonomous vehicles; however, they are essential to them, with significant implications not only for their capabilities as communications platforms, but also more generally for their governance and political economy.</p>

<p>Retailers are implementing technology-enabled mobile checkout processes in their stores to improve service quality, decrease labor costs and gain operational efficiency. These new checkout processes have increased customer convenience primarily by providing them <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in sales transactions in that store employee interventions play a reduced role. However, this <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> has the unintended consequence of altering the checks and balances inherent in a traditional employee-assisted checkout process. Retailers, already grappling with shoplifting, with an estimated annual cost of billions of dollars, fear that the problem may be exacerbated by mobile checkout and concomitant customer <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The purpose of this paper is to understand the effect of mobile checkout processes in retail stores on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>crime in the form of shoplifting enabled by a technology transformed the retail environment.,The authors conducted an online survey of a US sample recruited from a crowdsourced platform. The authors test a research model that aims to understand the factors that influence the intention to shoplift in three different mobile checkout settings − namely, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> checkout settings, store-provided mobile device checkout settings, and employee-assisted mobile checkout settings − and compare it with a traditional fixed location checkout setting.,The authors found that, in a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> checkout setting, intention to shoplift was driven by experiential beliefs and peer influence, and experiential beliefs and peer influence had a stronger effect for prospective shoplifters when compared to experienced shoplifters; in a store-provided mobile devices checkout setting, experiential beliefs had a negative effect on shoplifters’ intention to shoplift and the effect was weaker for prospective shoplifters when compared to experienced shoplifters. The results also indicated that in an employee-assisted mobile checkout setting, intention to shoplift was driven by experiential beliefs and peer influence, and experiential beliefs had a stronger effect for prospective shoplifters when compared to experienced shoplifters.,This study is the among the first, if not first, to examine shoplifters’ intention to shoplift in mobile checkout settings. We provide insights into how those who may not have considered shoplifting in less favorable criminogenic settings may change their behavior due to the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> provided by mobile checkout settings and also provide an understanding of the shoplifting intention for both prospective and experienced shoplifters in different mobile checkout settings.</p>

<p>Educational research is increasingly paying attention to students’ out-of-class learning. Students’ out-of-class learning is linked to improved class performance and constitutes an important part of learner development. Prior research has argued that learning-resources provision should encourage students’ autonomous learning both in and out of the classroom [Benson, 2013; Benson &amp; Reinders, 2011; Gardner &amp; Miller, 1999; Little, 1997; Richards, 2015]. However, work on <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> often proceeds via generalities rather than focusing on its enactment in individual behavior. Accordingly, this study investigated 35 EFL undergraduates’ autonomous learning behaviors and their use of resources of the learning center of a university. Data were collected via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> interviews with the participants and examination of their resources-usage records. Content analysis of the interview data, using six categories based on a learner-<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> model, was used to generate each participant’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> score. Spearman rho testing of the relationship between those scores and the students’ resources-usage scores suggested a very strong positive relationship between autonomous learning behaviors and overall usage of resources, as well as the variety of those resources used by individuals. Data analysis also revealed that, to varying degrees, each participant’s autonomous-learning behaviors (based on qualitative examples) fell into more than one of the six learner-<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> types. Based on these findings, it is recommended that students be encouraged to learn beyond the classroom through pedagogical activities that link classroom learning to learning-center resources. Based on the findings of this study we make suggestions on pedagogical design with SAC and applications for SACs in other educational contexts.</p>

<p>Purpose There is an on-going debate about the role of workplace <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> leisure (WIL) and whether it is a vice or virtue. Considering this, the purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of WIL on workplace outcome variables such as employee satisfaction (ES) and employee productivity in the Malaysian context. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire that yielded 282 responses. Partial least square technique using SmartPLS-3 was used to test the study hypotheses. Findings Findings reveal that workplace WIL, workplace WIL policy and workplace <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> orientation (WAO) affect employees’ satisfaction. Additionally, the mediating role of ES was found to be significant. Practical implications The findings of this study are valuable for both managers and policy makers. These results can benefit the managers of conventional banks in Malaysia to decide how to enhance employees’ satisfaction and productivity by focusing on the key drivers such as WIL, workplace <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> leisure policy (WILP) and WAO. Originality/value This is a pioneering study which suggests that moderate use of WIL can have a positive and significant effect on workplace outcome variables. Moreover, this study theorised ES as a mediating variable; this helps to explain how organisations can transform workplace resources in term of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> leisure, WILP and WAO into high productivity by elevating employees’ satisfaction.</p>

<p>The combined trends of learner-centred teaching and ubiquitous technology use in the classroom have given instructors a unique opportunity to support students in developing lifelong learning skills. Heutagogy (or self-determined learning) provides a promising framework for capitalizing on these developing trends, drawing on established learner-centred education theories that strongly emphasize learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The key principles of heutagogy – learner agency, self-efficacy and capability, reflection and metacognition, and non-linear learning – provide a foundation for designing and developing learning ecologies, the potential of which can be further maximized through the use of digital media. This article describes the theory of heutagogy and the learner-centred pedagogies on which the theory is founded, as well as providing an explanation of the pedagogy-andragogy-heutagogy (PAH) continuum and its use in developing student skills. It also explores the role of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> in supporting the development of those skills.</p>

<p>The development of computing tools and technologies of corporate networks has expanded the range of educational and information services in corporate research and education networks (CRES). CRES belong to critical <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netic information systems (CCIS) built on the basis of open network models. In the early 80s of the 20th century, this approach did not consider the need to build a security system, which does not allow it to provide the required level of protection against modern hybrid threats. The transition to <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in decision-making, education and university management all over the world places requirements to ensuring the required quality of service (QoS) of CRES clients. CRES users include university administration, faculty, students and support personnel of educational services in higher education institutions. One of the main criteria for QoS is information security. However, there is no general approach to building integrated information security in CRES, which would provide the required level of security. The methodology is based on the concept of synthesizing a synergistic model of threats to CCIS, improved models of CRES infrastructure, an intruder, assessing the current state of information security (IS) and improved method of investment in the CRES IS. It is shown that the basis of the synergistic model is a three-level model of strategic security management, which provides a synergistic effect in the context of simultaneous threats to information security, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security and security of information. In contrast to the known, such an approach provides for the determination of qualitatively new and previously unknown emergent properties of the information security system, taking into account the means used to create it. The application of the methodology in practice through the development and implementation of new solutions to provide security services allows for the required level of information security in CRES. The proposed information security service mechanisms are built on hybrid cryptosystems based on crypto-code structures with&nbsp; flawed codes.</p>

<p>Since 2016, when the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>/Cambridge Analytica scandal began to emerge, public concern has grown around the threat of “online manipulation”. While these worries are familiar to privacy researchers, this paper aims to make them more salient to policymakers—first, by defining “online manipulation”, thus enabling identification of manipulative practices; and second, by drawing attention to the specific harms online manipulation threatens. We argue that online manipulation is the use of information technology to covertly influence another person’s decision-making, by targeting and exploiting their decision-making vulnerabilities. Engaging in such practices can harm individuals by diminishing their economic interests, but its deeper, more insidious harm is its challenge to individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. We explore this <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> harm, emphasising its implications for both individuals and society, and we briefly outline some strategies for combating online manipulation and strengthening <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in an increasingly digital world.</p>

<p>We live in a digital age. While increased channels of communication and worldwide access have their benefits, there are also risks and problems associated with a virtual platform that gives instant access to information. This Article centers on “revenge porn,” one problem associated with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communication</span>s that has drawn the attention of both the media and the legal community. Revenge porn is the practice of distributing nude or sexually explicit photos or videos of an individual without his or her consent. It is usually posted by a former lover in order to harm, humiliate, or otherwise seek revenge upon the subject of the material after the relationship has ended. This issue implicates principles of sexual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, particularly for women: if we want to encourage sexual freedom, we must protect people from others’ abuse of that freedom. Legal actors are divided on how best to approach the revenge porn problem. Some advocate for civil action in order to compensate victims, while others believe that drafting new criminal laws and punishing offenders is the correct answer. Still others believe that no action is required at all, blaming the victims of revenge porn instead of the distributors. This Article addresses the legal possibilities, weighing their benefits and detractors in order to decide the proper solution for revenge porn in the U.S. It concludes that, while the criminal law is the appropriate forum for revenge porn litigation, new statues are both problematic and unnecessary. Instead of drafting targeted revenge porn legislation, police and prosecutors should pursue offenders utilizing existing laws, such as harassment, extortion, and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-stalking.</p>

<p>Nursing has not yet received full social recognition and in general the public opinion does not have a completely positive perception of it, which regards it as an auxiliary profession to the medical profession. This study aims to investigate the image of the nurse among year 4 and 5 high school students.Two groups of students were interviewed, one at their institution without any previous orientation (n = 102) and one at the University of Bologna during orientation day (n = 388). A validated questionnaire (Nursing Attitude Questionnaire) of 30 items was delivered. Two additional questions were added to explore the possibility of advising relatives and acquaintances to become a nurse and therefore to choose the nursing degree course.All areas of the NAQ scored significantly higher in the group where students attended the orientation day, especially the ones related to the professional role, stereotypes and professional value items. Female students ≥ 21 had a more positive image of the nurse. Both groups recognized that nurses are important figures for patients and that they are intelligent people, who must have a degree in order to carry out their work duties. Differences between the groups were recorded. Students in group 1 did not accept nursing <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> while students in group 2 understood differences between nursing and medical careers, attributing to them the same value. A positive correlation between the positive image of the nursing profession and the interest in becoming nurses or advising others to undertake the nursing course was found. In conclusion, orientation is effective in helping high school students in the choice of their university courses. Regarding nursing, strategies to improve the image of the nurse and enrollment should be combined during orientation day with current up to date communication and learning tools, such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and simulation laboratories. Furthermore, it appears increasingly important to extend orientation and tutoring activities to junior high school students, families and teachers.</p>

<p>The popularity of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) has had a significant influence on the reading proficiency of early adolescents. Achieving excellent reading proficiency, which is related not only to a student’s inherent talent but also to various impact factors, can greatly enhance the effectiveness of reading education. The Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2015 provides an international view on the reading proficiency of 15-year-olds in a computer-based testing environment. In this study, a multiple linear regression model was constructed using the computing language R to investigate the association between student-level ICT impact factors (the availability of ICT, the use of ICT and attitudes toward ICT) and reading proficiency among early adolescents. The sample included 37,155 15-year-olds from five representative countries with extremely high reading proficiency. The results showed that the students’ ICT-related attitudinal factors concerning their interest in ICT and perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in using ICT, rather than ICT availability and ICT use, were closely associated with high reading proficiency. In addition, ICT devices should be integrated not only as instructional media but also as a cognitive tool for teaching reading with timely and appropriate scrutiny.</p>

<p>Critical assessments of the recent resurgence of right-wing nationalism have rightly highlighted the role of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> in these troubling times, yet they are constrained by an overemphasis on celebrity leaders defined as populists. This article departs from a leader-centric analysis and the liberal frame that still largely informs assessment of political action, to foreground “fun” as a salient aspect of right-wing mobilization. Building on ethnographic fieldwork among the Hindu nationalists in India, I argue that fun is a metapractice that shapes the interlinked practices of fact-checking, abuse, assembly, and aggression among online volunteers for the right-wing movement. Furthermore, fun remains crucial for an experience of absolute <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> among online users in ideological battles. Providing the daily drip feed for exclusion, fun as a metapractice bears a formal similarity to objectivity in its performative effects of distance and deniability.</p>

<p>The aim of this article is to review the empirical studies on the relationship between the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s use and subjective well-being of its users. Firstly, it has been pointed out that the outcomes of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s use depend on the type of usage (active or passive). Next, the studies attempting to explain why passive <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s use is related to reduced subjective well-being have been compiled, and specifically, the studies in which social comparisons and feeling of envy has been offered as an explanatory mechanism have been summarized. A need for researching about which emotions other than envy may potentially be triggered by the passive <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s use and how subjective well-being changes depending on those emotions has been brought forward. In addition, answers given to the questions of whether the relationships between the passive <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s use and the users’ emotions and subjective well-being depended on who have been contacted through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s were sought.</p>

<p>Background Current health care systems are rarely designed to meet the needs of people living with chronic conditions. However, some patients and informal caregivers are not waiting for the health care system to redesign itself. These individuals are sometimes referred to as e-patients. The first generation of e-patients used the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> for finding information and for communicating with peers. Compared with the first generation, the second generation of e-patients collects their own health data and appears to be more innovative. Objective The aim of this study was to describe the second generation of e-patients through exploration of their active engagement in their self-care and health care. Methods Semistructured interviews were conducted with 10 patients with chronic conditions and 5 informal caregivers. They were all recruited through a Web-based advertisement. Data were analyzed according to the framework analysis approach, using the 3 concepts of the self-determination theory—<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, relatedness, and competence—at the outset. Results Study participants were actively engaged in influencing their self-care and the health care system to improve their own health, as well as the health of others. This occurred at different levels, such as using their own experience when giving presentations and lectures to health care professionals and medical students, working as professional peers in clinical settings, performing self-tracking, contributing with innovations, and being active on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. When interaction with health care providers was perceived as being insufficient, the participants sought support through their peers, which showed strong relatedness. Competence increased through the use of technology and learning experiences with peers. Their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> was important but was sometimes described as involuntary and to give up was not an option for them. Conclusions Like the first generation of e-patients, the participants frequently searched for Web-based information. However, the second generation of e-patients also produce their own health data, which they learn from and share. They also engage in the innovation of digital tools to meet health-related needs. Utilizing technological developments comes naturally to the second generation of e-patients, even if the health care system is not prepared to support them under these new circumstances.</p>

<p>Over the past two decades, there has been growing awareness of and critical interest in the convergence of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies and automobiles. Writing in 2004, Mike Featherstone suggests that the automobile becomes a new form of communications platform with a complex set of possibilities. In this article, we argue that the notion of the car as a communication platform continues to form a productive way of thinking about autonomous vehicles. The argument we develop is that the dual roles of data acquisition and management, and local processing are integral to any understanding of the contemporary autonomous vehicle’s machinic complex. Both of these things are strongly associated with <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and the transformation of cars into decision-making machines. We use the example of mapping to argue that these capacities are not unique to the emerging technologies of autonomous vehicles; however, they are essential to them, with significant implications not only for their capabilities as communications platforms, but also more generally for their governance and political economy.</p>

<p>Distance education requires an instructional design approach that can lead to educational transformation. This is characterised by advanced flexibility, learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and extensive use of digital technologies to enhance learning outcomes. The main feature of such methodology is the physical distance between teaching staff, peers and educational institutions. Various technological tools are used to bridge this distance and improve communication and interaction. This article attempts to review the literature in the field, with the aim of highlighting strategies for enhancing communication and interaction in online learning environments. After discussing the theoretical framework for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communication</span> and interaction, the authors outline the factors involved in creating well-structured, interactive and dynamic online courses and programmes for higher education students. The article explores the multi-dimensional aspects of communication in online learning environments and the differing forms of interaction involved. Using qualitative methods, the authors’ aim is to produce a framework to help tutors and instructional designers develop more effective online courses in higher education. In addition, this article may be of value to researchers and scholar-practitioners interested in communication issues, to online learning designers, and to institutional managers recruiting teaching staff for online educational courses.</p>

<p>Learning how to speak English might be challenging in a distance education program, due to its necessity of methodological adaptations to those who teach, as well as to the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> necessary to those who learn. This work aimed at investigating how the Virtual University Institute (UFC Virtual), connected to the Federal University of Ceara in partnership with The Open University of Brazil (UAB), enables licentiate degree students to learn how to speak English. The corpus of this research is the English Language – Oral Production and Oral Comprehension course, offered during the third term of the undergraduate program, between March and May 2018. In this qualitative study, we develop a participant observation, accessing the website Solar, a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE), in order to analyze which resources were available for students to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> between them and with their tutor. We verify which type of interactions were offered in the platform: synchronous (communication in real time); asynchronous (learning opportunities that can be accessed at any time); or multi-synchronous (combining the two forms of delivery). We exam, as well, the scripts provided during the speaking tasks, aiming at identifying if the students would practice authentic conversations, or if they would repeat previous formulated phrases. The results show that the learners did not have opportunities to communicate in real time at a distance English learning environment from Solar, nor to receive corrections or synchronic feedback from the tutor. We also confirm that the scripted tasks could allow the students to not engage in spontaneous dialogues.</p>

<p>Consent has enjoyed a prominent position in the American privacy system since at least 1970, though historically, consent emerged from traditional notions of tort and contract. Largely because consent has an almost deferential power as a proxy for consumer choice, organizations increasingly use consent as a de facto standard for demonstrating privacy commitments. The Department of Health and Human Services and the Federal Trade Commission have integrated the concept of consent into health care, research, and general commercial activities. Despite consent’s prominence in U.S. law, this article seeks to understand, more fully, consent’s origins and development, then applies a philosophical-legal lens to clearly identify problems with consent in its current use. Jurgen Habermas’ theory of communicative action as it applies to private and public spheres and Helen Nissenbaum’s model for contextual inquiry provide useful lenses for understanding the impact of consent on human <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. This article suggests five resulting problems for human <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, the “consent myth,” and four principles for addressing these problems in contemporary health technologies, such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Health Things (IoHT) and artificial intelligence (AI) applications.</p>

<p>This article addresses perceptions that higher education teachers have on the integration of technology in evaluation processes, focusing on their beliefs about learning, evaluation and technology that enable or hinder this pedagogical innovation. This study considered teachers as part of a project using rubrics in Moodle to evaluate learning in a Chilean higher education institution in 2014, 2015 and 2016. Forming and evaluating in a competency-based approach involves challenges for the teaching staff and changes in their role that are accepted or resisted. The same happens in the face of innovation processes with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICT) integration in teaching practices. The primary results show a relationship between pedagogical beliefs and evaluation which is consistent with adoption and assessment of the digital tool used. In addition, it reveals the role of beliefs as secondary barriers to change in the face of access or primary barriers (Ertmert, 1999). The value of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in student work and feedback are identified as key beliefs in technology adoption.</p>

<p>The benefits and importance of university <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for facilitating and accelerating higher education transformation have been broadly agreed by many higher education stakeholders. This paper aims to investigate the Malaysian public and private universities degree of independence and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> from the government and other external forces. The extent of an institute’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is measured based on their independent in appointive, academic, administrative, and financial matters. An <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>ed survey has been sent to top-level management of 28 public and private universities in Malaysia, resulting in 126 respondents. The respondents for the survey consisted of vice-chancellors, deputy vice-chancellors, deans, directors, and deputy deans. Using SPSS statistical software, data were analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistical analysis. The results demonstrate that the majority of the components under academic matters, administrative and financial matters are considered high <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, with less interference of the government over those institutions. With some reason, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> related to the appointment of the vice-chancellors and dismissals of rectors and vice-chancellors is still under government control. However, based on the findings, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> development at public and private universities in Malaysia has been engaged in a long journey that enabled it to compete and to progress well at the global level.</p>

<p>The focus of this current research is two-fold: (1) to understand how team interaction in human-<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> teams (HAT)s evolve in the Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) task context, and (2) to understand how HATs respond to three types of failures (automation, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-attack) over time. We summarize the findings from three of our recent experiments regarding the team interaction within HAT over time in the dynamic context of RPAS. For the first and the second experiments, we summarize general findings related to team member interaction of a three-member team over time, by comparison of HATs with all-human teams. In the third experiment, which extends beyond the first two experiments, we investigate HAT evolution when HATs are faced with three types of failures during the task. For all three of these experiments, measures focus on team interactions and temporal dynamics consistent with the theory of interactive team cognition. We applied Joint Recurrence Quantification Analysis, to communication flow in the three experiments. One of the most interesting and significant findings from our experiments regarding team evolution is the idea of entrainment, that one team member (the pilot in our study, either agent or human) can change the communication behaviors of the other teammates over time, including coordination, and affect team performance. In the first and second studies, behavioral passiveness of the synthetic teams resulted in very stable and rigid coordination in comparison to the all-human teams that were less stable. Experimenter teams demonstrated metastable coordination (not rigid nor unstable) and performed better than rigid and unstable teams during the dynamic task. In the third experiment, metastable behavior helped teams overcome all three types of failures. These summarized findings address three potential future needs for ensuring effective HAT: (1) training of autonomous agents on the principles of teamwork, specifically understanding tasks and roles of teammates, (2) human-centered machine learning design of the synthetic agent so the agents can better understand human behavior and ultimately human needs, and (3) training of human members to communicate and coordinate with agents due to current limitations of Natural Language Processing of the agents.</p>

<p>Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to highlight the importance of of science(academic freedom)for the advancement of society and mankind, which, however, is permanently endangered by powerful organisations, groups and individuals, who in pursuit of their one-sided interests are seeking to constrain information about the truth. As a broad term, of science embraces in research, learning, teachingand publication. All of these activities should be dedicated to identifying the truth and learning about the truth. Design/methodology/approach – Three theoretical approaches are of importance for framing issues related to of science, which in this paper are integrated into the framework of mindset agency theory: is a value; is claimed by agents who pursue specific interests (goals), which might constrain others; and individuals are agents who are interacting with each other within a social system–cooperation, ignorance or conflict. Findings – Freedom as a value is at the core of intellectual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Intellectual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is a necessarycondition for innovation and advancement of knowledge. The observable modes of interaction/coexistenceamong researchers are influenced by individual research goals and by the researchers’ access to resources, which may be deliberately constrained by opponents or other researchers as competitors. Research limitations/implications – For further research, which is beyond this paper, the authors can refer to: analyses of challenges of freedom – in terms of ethics, protection of individual humanrights, political pressures and conflicts of interests; the issues of truth, i.e.&nbsp;the impact of fake news andcreation of alternate facts; and the relation between academic and employment (academic tenure) inpresent-day societies. Owing to lack of space, this paper cannot deal with the danger emerging from powerful organisations or powerful individuals, who are challenging of science. Social implications–If there is no of science then social progress is constrained. If there is no access to right data, decisions will be wrong. Originality/value – So far, a comprehensive <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netic model was not published, which supports systems thinking about scholars and teachers (inter)acting in research organisations.</p>

<p>Prosocial violent media (e.g., media that combines both violent and prosocial content) is especially popular in entertainment media today. However, it remains unclear how parental media monitoring is associated with exposure to prosocial violent content and adolescent behavior. Accordingly, 1,193 adolescents were asked about parental media monitoring, media content exposure, and behavior. Main findings suggest that <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> supportive restrictive monitoring was associated with lower levels of exposure to prosocial violent content, but only among older adolescents. Additionally, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> supportive restrictive monitoring was the only form of parental media monitoring associated with lower levels of violent content and higher levels of prosocial content, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> supportive active monitoring was the only parental monitoring strategy that promoted prosocial behavior via exposure to pro<span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> content. Discussion focuses on the importance of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> supportive parental monitoring, as well as the implications of parents encouraging their children to watch media with limited violent content-even if it is prosocial violent content.</p>

<p>Abstract The analysis of large amounts of personal data with artificial neural networks for deep learning is the driving technology behind new artificial intelligence (AI) systems for all areas in science and technology. These AI methods have evolved from applications in computer vision, the automated analysis of images, and now include frameworks and methods for analyzing multimodal datasets that combine data from many different source, including biomedical devices, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s and common user behavior in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>space. For neuroscience, these widening streams of personal data and machine learning methods provide many opportunities for basic data-driven research as well as for developing new tools for diagnostic, predictive and therapeutic applications for disorders of the nervous system. The increasing automation and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of AI systems, however, also creates substantial ethical challenges for basic research and medical applications. Here, scientific and medical opportunities as well ethical challenges are summarized and discussed.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) for mental disorders are seen by some authors as a&nbsp;step forward to narrow the treatment gap in mental health; however, especially in Germany professionals voice ethical concerns against the implementation of IMIs. The fact that there is broad evidence in favor of IMIs and that IMIs have already been implemented in several countries requires an ethical analysis to answer these concerns. OBJECTIVE The objective is to tackle ethical issues connected to a&nbsp;possible implementation of IMIs for mental disorders in Germany and to point out possible solutions. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted an ethical analysis using the criteria of well-being of patients, non-maleficence, justice, and patient <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, based on the empirical evidence. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION The ethical analysis showed that IMIs for mental disorders principally have a&nbsp;positive effect on the well-being of patients and have a low risk of impairment. Additionally, IMIs can minimize risk, improve justice, and strengthen <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of mentally ill patients. Despite the broad evidence, there are still research desiderates with respect to ethical aspects, e. g. patient information for mentally ill patients.</p>

<p>To lose freedom of thought (FoT) is to lose our dignity, our democracy and our very selves. Accordingly, the right to FoT receives absolute protection under international human rights law. However, this foundational right has been neither significantly developed nor often utilized. The contours of this right urgently need to be defined due to twenty-first century threats to FoT posed by new technologies. As such, this paper draws on law and psychology to consider what the right to FoT should be in the twenty-first century. After discussing contemporary threats to FoT, and recent developments in our understanding of thought that can inform the development of the right, this paper considers three elements of the right; the rights not to reveal one’s thoughts, not to be penalized for one’s thoughts, and not to have one’s thoughts manipulated. The paper then considers, for each element, why it should exist, how the law currently treats it, and challenges that will shape it going forward. The paper concludes that the law should develop the right to FoT with the clear understanding that what this aims to secure is mental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. This process should hence begin by establishing the core mental processes that enable mental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, such as attentional and cognitive agency. The paper argues that the domain of the right to FoT should be extended to include external actions that are arguably constitutive of thought, including <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> searches and diaries, hence shielding them with absolute protection. It is stressed that law must protect us from threats to FoT from both states and corporations, with governments needing to act under the positive aspect of the right to ensure societies are structured to facilitate mental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. It is suggested that in order to support mental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, information should be provided in <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive contexts and friction introduced into decision making processes to facilitate second-order thought. The need for public debate about how society wishes to balance risk and mental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is highlighted, and the question is raised as to whether the importance attached to thought has changed in our culture. The urgency of defending FoT is re-iterated.</p>

<p>Patient-centered communication (PCC) by healthcare professionals can contribute to enacting and facilitating patients’ self-management of chronic health conditions. This study investigates the emerging patterns of PCC that occur in an mHealth-based diabetes prevention program for older adults. The analysis of user-coach communication data during the 16-week period of the program revealed four PCC strategies employed by coaches: (a) triggering reflections on users’ routinized habits, (b) jointly determining a measurable health goal, (c) facilitating self-evaluations on recent behavior change, and (d) tailoring programs to adapt to users’ lifestyle and health status. To advance these strategies, coaches utilized various mHealth features that helped them (a) engage in data-driven coaching, (b) increase situational awareness of users’ health conditions and routines, (c) provide continuous support to users through regular and spontaneous in-app <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>s, and (d) foster user <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and engagement. The findings extend implications for developing technology-enabled healthcare practice to enhance self-management of chronic illness.</p>

<p>The emulation of human behavior for autonomous problem solving has been an interdisciplinary field of research. Generally, classical control systems are used for static environments, where external disturbances and changes in internal parameters can be fully modulated before or neglected during operation. However, classical control systems are inadequate at addressing environmental uncertainty. By contrast, autonomous systems, which were first studied in the field of control systems, can be applied in an unknown environment. This paper summarizes the state of the art autonomous systems by first discussing the definition, modeling, and system structure of autonomous systems and then providing a perspective on how autonomous systems can be integrated with advanced resources (e.g., the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> of Things, big data, Over-the-Air, and federated learning). Finally, what comes after reaching full <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is briefly discussed.</p>

<p>Decentralized <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is a long-standing research topic in information sciences and social sciences. The self-organization phenomenon in natural ecosystems, the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span> Movement Organizations (CMOs) on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, and the Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI), and so on, can all be regarded as its early manifestations. In recent years, the rapid development of blockchain technology has spawned the emergence of the so-called Decentralized Autonomous Organization [DAO, sometimes labeled as Decentralized Autonomous Corporation (DAC)], which is a new organization form that the management and operational rules are typically encoded on blockchain in the form of smart contracts, and can autonomously operate without centralized control or third-party intervention. DAO is expected to overturn the traditional hierarchical management model and significantly reduce organizations’ costs on communication, management, and collaboration. However, DAO still faces many challenges, such as security and privacy issue, unclear legal status, and so on. In this article, we strive to present a systematic introduction of DAO, including its concept and characteristics, research framework, typical implementations, challenges, and future trends. Especially, a novel reference model for DAO which employs a five-layer architecture is proposed. This article is aimed at providing helpful guidance and reference for future research efforts.</p>

<p>Autonomous systems will soon be integrating into our lives as home assistants, delivery drones, and driverless cars. The implementation of the level of automation in these systems from being manually controlled to fully autonomous would depend upon the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> approach chosen to design these systems. This article reviews the historical evolution of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, its approaches, and the current trends in related fields to build robust autonomous systems. Toward such a goal and with the increased number of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>attacks, the security of these systems needs special attention from the research community. To gauge the extent to which research has been done in this area, we discuss the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security of these systems. It is essential to model the system from a security perspective, identify the threats and vulnerabilities, and then model the attacks. A survey in this direction explores the theoretical/analytical system and attack models that have been proposed over the years and identifies the research gap that needs to be addressed by the research community.</p>

<p>Visual impairments (VIs) impose many barriers to people when it comes to information access, and educational processes may offer tools for people to overcome these barriers and, consequently, develop <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and an active sense of citizenship. In these processes, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICTs) improve accessibility. Our aim was to use ICT, especially <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, in pedagogical activities developed for students with VI (blindness and low vision). Focus group interviews about technology use showed us that these students are heavy users of WhatsApp, an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">instant mess</span>enger app. We then established an online discussion group, as a community of practice, using WhatsApp as a discussion environment. This online group helped Brazilian students with VI develop social skills and discuss health issues they considered important to them.</p>

<p>This article presents issues related to the evolution of media and media competences, a review and analysis of selected historical, technological and educational conditions in the context of the development of digital technologies. A comparison is also made between digital, information and media competences, current development trends and future trends. The differences and requirements between qualified media users and qualified users of information technology are becoming less and less distinct. The 3 generations of Media education - 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 were described. The main purpose of media education in the first phase of development, referred to as media education 1.0, was to develop not only critical thinking skills towards the media and media messages, but also - in a general sense - critical attitude and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Media 2.0 education can be discussed in connection with the dynamic development of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies, including <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, at the beginning of the 21st century.

<p>The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> would seem to be an ideal platform for fostering the development of multiple overlapping communities seeking to be governed by their own norms. The very structure of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> resists centralized governance, while the opportunities it provides for the “long tail” of expression means even voices with extremely small audiences can find a home. In reality, however, the governance of online speech looks much more monolithic. This is largely a result of private “lawmaking” activity by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> intermediaries. Increasingly, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> companies like <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span> are developing what David Kaye, United Nations (“UN”) Special Rapporteur for the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression, has called “platform law.” Through a combination of community standards, contract, technological design, and case-specific practice, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> companies are developing “<span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> law” and “<span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span> law” displacing the laws of national jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Using the example of content moderation, this paper makes several contributions to the literature. First, it expands upon the idea of “platform law” to consider the broad array of mechanisms that companies use to control user behavior and mediate conflicts. Second, using human rights law as a foundation, the paper makes the case for meaningful technological design choices that enable user <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Users should be able to make explicit choices about who and what they want to hear online. It also frames user choice in terms of the right to hear, not the right to speak, as a way of navigating the tension presented by hate speech and human rights without resorting to platform law that sanitizes speech for everyone.</p>

<p>Purpose This research sheds light on behavioral change by demonstrating the transformative power of a brand on the process of eating behavioral change. The selected brand is Three Times a Day (a culinary blog whose mission is to encourage a healthier diet). This study aims to identify food-related behavioral changes as a result of consumers’ relationship with this brand and identify antecedents to such changes. Design/methodology/approach A netnography of the brand <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>y and 14 individual in-depth interviews were conducted. Findings Netnography results identify four categories of behavioral changes emerging from the relationship with the brand (e.g.&nbsp;choosing healthier/more varied foods, developing an interest in cooking and adopting a healthier lifestyle). Analysis of the individual interviews substantiate the role of brand attachment as a driver of positive change and identify three antecedents: brand-self connection (through past, actual and ideal self), brand exposure and satisfaction of individual needs (i.e.&nbsp;<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence and relatedness). Research limitations/implications Results enrich the literature on behavioral change and highlight the positive role of a brand in the context of improving eating habits. Findings extend the understanding of the consequences of attachment beyond its influence at the attitudinal level by focusing on concrete consumer behavior. Social implications It is recognized that despite good intentions, individuals keep making poor food choices. This important issue is associated with several diseases and increasing social costs. This research explores how to influence consumers in adopting better eating habits. Originality/value This study is one of the first to examine the power of a food-related brand to enhance positive eating practices and improve diet.</p>

<p>Abstract Sovereignty and strategic <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> are felt to be at risk today, being threatened by the forces of rising international tensions, disruptive digital transformations and explosive growth of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security incidents. The combination of AI and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security is at the sharp edge of this development and raises many ethical questions and dilemmas. In this commentary, I analyse how we can understand the ethics of AI and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security in relation to sovereignty and strategic <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The analysis is followed by policy recommendations, some of which may appear to be controversial, such as the strategic use of ethics. I conclude with a reflection on underlying concepts as an invitation for further research. The goal is to inspire policy-makers, academics and business strategists in their work, and to be an input for public debate.</p>

<p>Background Suicide is one of the most frequent causes of death in young people worldwide. Depression lies at the root of this issue, a condition that has a significant negative impact on the lives of those who experience it and on society more generally. However, 80% of affected young people do not obtain professional help for depression and other mental health issues. Therefore, a key challenge is to find innovative and appealing ways to engage young people in learning to manage their mental health. Research suggests that young people prefer to access anonymous Web-based programs rather than get face-to-face help, which has led to the development of numerous <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> apps. However, the evidence indicates that not all of these apps are effective in engaging the interest of young people who are most in need of help. Objective The study aimed to investigate young people’s response to six currently available <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> apps for mental health and to identify features that young people like and dislike in such apps. Methods Focus groups were conducted with 23 young people aged 13 to 25 years in which they viewed and used six <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> apps for mental health. A general inductive approach following a realist paradigm guided data analysis. Results The results revealed that young people value <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and the opportunity to personalize experiences with these apps above other things. Finding a balance between simplicity and informativeness is also an important factor. Conclusions App developers need to consider using participant-design frameworks to ensure that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> apps are providing what young people want in a mental health app. Solutions to the need for personalization and increasing user engagement are also crucially needed.</p>

<p>I bear witness as a survivor of genocide orchestrated by imperialism and carried out by neocolonial stooges who proclaimed that ‘all is fair in warfare’ and that ‘starvation is a legitimate weapon of war’ even when Igbo women and innocent men made up the bulk of the 3.1 million people killed in Biafra in 30 months. I acknowledge the knowledge of the Indigenous peoples of this land and of every land that were colonized, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>telized, racialized, victimized, pulverized, dehumanized, genocidized, proletarianized, lumpenized, marginalized, and homogenized with the tools of criminology, among other tools, for the benefits of white-supremacist imperialist patriarchy. I testify that we are survivors who were never expected to survive to meet one another and raise our voices to say, Happy Survival! To say that we are survivors is not to suggest that we have completely restored our independence but to state that for as long as the forces of imperialism are entrenched, we are determined to resist. We will keep speaking truth to unjust power the way that our ancestors defiantly stuck out their tongues and flipped their middle fingers to force the conquerors to sign treaties recognizing our <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> as human beings equal in beauty, wisdom, culture, courage and originality. This article outlines the decolonization paradigm in criminology, the rationale for this paradigmatic shift, the major contributions to this paradigm, and a projection of the future agenda of the paradigm.</p>

<p>Based on the biopsychosocial model of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction, this study tested a moderated mediation model of familial (i.e., perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive parenting), psychological (i.e., need satisfaction) and biological (i.e., baseline respiratory sinus arrhythmia, RSA) factors to investigate how they jointly impact <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction in emerging adults; specifically, we explored whether RSA moderated the mediating effect of need satisfaction on the relation between perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive parenting and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction. A total of 146 Chinese undergraduates completed questionnaires on <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive parenting, need satisfaction and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction. RSA data were also obtained. Path analysis was used to test the proposed mediation and moderated mediation models. The results indicated that while the impact of perceived <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive parenting on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction was mediated by need satisfaction, RSA moderated this indirect effect. The indirect effect of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive parenting on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction via need satisfaction was much stronger in adults with low levels of RSA than in those with high levels of RSA. Our findings highlight the joint impact of biological, psychological, and social-environmental factors on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction and have important implications for the prevention of and intervention against emerging adults’ <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> addiction.</p>

<p>Purpose The development of self-service technologies, while intended to better serve customers by offering them <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, has created situations in which individuals may require additional help. The purpose of this paper is to explore perceptions of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> as an assistance channel, to identify its perceived role in a customer service environment. Design/methodology/approach In all, 23 semi-structured interviews held with both <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> and non-<span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> users assessed perceptions of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> in an assistance encounter. A thematic analysis was used. Findings The findings highlight a paradoxical perception of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> in a customer assistance context. On the one hand, customers perceive live <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> as mainly beneficial in a customer service context, alleviating embarrassment, perceived threats and potential dissatisfaction linked to assistance requests. On the other hand, the elusive nature of a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> conversation interlocutor (human or artificial) adversely affects how customers interpret assistance from companies. Research limitations/implications This research underscores the perceived threats of assistance encounters and shows the ambivalent role of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> in such a context. It also highlights <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>’s specific features that make it a relevant medium for assistance requests.

<p>Abstract Physical frailty represents a clinical condition among older adults leading to adverse health outcomes, such as <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> loss. To evaluate physical frailty in older adults, adopting <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICT) may be useful. ADAMO (Caretek S.r.l.) is a care-watch accelerometer that allows to measure mobility in a non-intrusive way (Magistro et al., 2018) providing wider information on individual general health (Mulasso et al., in press). The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between indoor mobility, physical frailty and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in a sample of Italian older adults. Methods: Thirty-two volunteers (age 65–84 years; women 56.2%) participated in the study. All wore ADAMO care-watch continuously over a 7-day period. The number of steps indoor was the main endpoint. Fragmented daily mobility was estimated. Physical frailty and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> were measured using the Tilburg Frailty Indicator (physical components) and the Groningen Activity Restriction Scale, respectively. Results: Significant inverse correlations were observed between number of steps and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and number of steps and physical frailty. Conversely, a significant direct correlation was observed between physical frailty and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Additionally, mediation analysis demonstrated full mediation effect of physical frailty between the number of steps and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Our results imply that high indoor mobility per se can reduce physical frailty and consequently helps to maintain <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Conclusions: Indoor mobility captured by ADAMO accelerometer may be an important indicator of physical frailty and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. ADAMO may be used as a non-intrusive telemonitoring solution to capture relevant information on individual general health in aged people.</p>

<p>The amount of time adolescents spend communicating via digital technologies such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s has led to concerns that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">computer-mediated</span> communication (CMC) is displacing face-to-face (FtF) interactions and disrupting social development. Although many studies have examined CMC in adolescents’ relationships with friends, few studies have examined the role of CMC in adolescents’ renegotiation of closeness and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> with parents. To examine this issue, we administered an online daily diary with 169 U.S. adolescents to estimate the time they spend in CMC and FtF interactions and the number of texts they exchange with friends and parents. On the last day of the survey, we asked adolescents about their emotional closeness to friends and parents and their balance of closeness and volition with parents. Overall, we found more evidence for social stimulation than displacement effects of CMC. Texts and CMC time with friends predicted friend closeness after accounting for FtF time with friends; texts with parents predicted parent closeness after accounting for FtF time with parents. We also found support for our hypothesis that CMC would be associated with greater adolescent volition. CMC time with parents predicted greater volitional dependence (volition plus closeness) whereas texts with friends predicted greater independent decision-making (volition plus distance). We discuss how communication technologies are integrated into U.S. adolescents’ relationships with friends and parents and how CMC can facilitate, rather than stifle, adolescents’ adjustment of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-relatedness with parents and their construction of emotional closeness with friends.

<p>The rise of contemporary platforms—from GAFAM in the West to the “three kingdoms” of the Chinese <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>—is reconfiguring the production, distribution, and monetization of cultural content in staggering and complex ways. Given the nature and extent of these transformations, how can we systematically examine the platformization of cultural production? In this introduction, we propose that a comprehensive understanding of this process is as much institutional (markets, governance, and infrastructures), as it is rooted in everyday cultural practices. It is in this vein that we present fourteen original articles that reveal how platformization involves key shifts in practices of labor, creativity, and citizenship. Diverse in their methodological approaches and topical foci, these contributions allow us to see how platformization is unfolding across cultural, geographic, and sectoral-industrial contexts. Despite their breadth and scope, these articles can be mapped along four thematic clusters: continuity and change; diversity and creativity; labor in an age of algorithmic systems; and power, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and citizenship.</p>

<p>Critical assessments of the recent resurgence of right-wing nationalism have rightly highlighted the role of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> in these troubling times, yet they are constrained by an overemphasis on celebrity leaders defined as populists. This article departs from a leader-centric analysis and the liberal frame that still largely informs assessment of political action, to foreground “fun” as a salient aspect of right-wing mobilization. Building on ethnographic fieldwork among the Hindu nationalists in India, I argue that fun is a metapractice that shapes the interlinked practices of fact-checking, abuse, assembly, and aggression among online volunteers for the right-wing movement. Furthermore, fun remains crucial for an experience of absolute <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> among online users in ideological battles. Providing the daily drip feed for exclusion, fun as a metapractice bears a formal similarity to objectivity in its performative effects of distance and deniability.</p>

<p>Abstract To date, autonomous shipping appears to primarily have been about a technology push rather than considering and providing sociotechnical solutions including re-design of work, capturing knowledge and addressing human factors in modern shipping. Autonomous shipping is frequently claimed to reduce human error, whereas in reality, any issue connected to humans will arguably move with the people from ship to shore in that different people will make different mistakes; with possibly more severe consequences. Furthermore, autonomous shipping is likely to require changes to regulation and increased attention to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> security and other IT human-centred quality factors if it is to succeed. What the HUMANE project is interested in is how (in certain scenarios) the human collaborates with, hands over to, or takes over from the technology/automation to achieve an overall safe state of the system. The aim is to map and investigate a potential gap between current human skills, training and education and an autonomous maritime future, and to provide insight to enable mitigating change. The main project method is expert workshops, performed in a focus group style. Four workshops are planned and to date (mid 2019), two have been performed. The topic of the first was technology, and the second was legal, class and insurance implications. For this paper, we have analysed the data relevant to future skills. Results show that not only is the skill set imagined to be needed very different from that of today, it also contains many contradictory elements and, occasionally, demands for abilities that humans do not possess, and are unlikely to evolve.</p>

<i> Hadar Aviram </i></p>
<p>On October 3, 2018, more than 2,400 law professors signed a letter addressed to the U.S. Senate, titled The Senate Should Not Confirm Kavanaugh. In the letter, the signatories argued that Brett Kavanaugh’s demeanor and tone during his confirmation hearing demonstrated a lack of judicial temperament and evinced his unfitness for high judicial office.</p>
<p>Like many of my colleagues, I was deeply discomfited by the hearings, which reduced fact-finding to a partisan context and echoed the cultural acceptability of disrespect of women’s bodily <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> — an obviously infuriating state of affairs. And yet, the reaction to the hearings by Kavanaugh’s opponents left me wondering: What were we hoping to accomplish by mocking and reviling this man? By expecting him to apologize or take responsibility and then trumpeting the inadequacy of his response? Was this hearing, and our polarized reactions to it, making inroads for gender equality? Would this become a conversation starter, one that, as my progressive and feminist colleagues argued, would “spark a reckoning” with the system?</p>
<p>This essay argues that the strong sentiments against Kavanaugh, though understandable and keenly felt, might have been deployed in the wrong direction, and an example of a broader phenomenon that I refer to as progressive punitivism. Progressive punitivism is the reliance on weapons traditionally wielded by the conservative right — shaming, stigmatization, denial of rehabilitation, punitive approaches, and identity-driven divisions — in the service of social justice ideals. Progressive punitivism operates within the criminal justice system, in the context of holding violent police officers, hate criminals, sexual abusers, and lenient judges accountable for their actions, but it also operates throughout the realm of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and public opinion, and these two realms often cross paths in complex ways.</p>
<p>The marshaling of much progressive energy in the direction of punishing powerful individuals for their misdeeds should be viewed with ambivalence. On one hand, the desire for accountability on the part of the powerful and socially advantaged is understandable; on the other, I am deeply skeptical as to the potential of progressive punitivism to effectuate change and bring about mutual understanding, let alone a reckoning. My concern is that the recurrence to punitive methods sows divisiveness and rancor, discredits efforts at rapprochement or apology at the outset and thus discourages them, and directs the movement’s energy in poisonous, and ultimately futile, directions. In short, I think that the effort to dismantle the master’s house of misogyny and racial domination with the master’s tools — a recurrence to punitivism, excoriation, and shaming — is doomed to fail.</p>
<p>This essay proceeds in four parts. In Part I I problematize the idea of the accused’s demeanor as evidence of guilt, remorse, or entitlement, arguing that we tend to overestimate our ability to deduce internal states of mind from people’s behavior and expressions. Part II assesses the potential (or lack thereof) of public performances of reckoning to produce a valuable expression of remorse, discussing the value of contingent apologies. Part III expands the framework to examine the way our politically fractured field responds to partisan efforts to excoriate culprits, arguing that “starting a national conversation” on the basis of excoriation and stigmatization is not a realistic expectation. In Part IV I situate the Kavanaugh incident in the overall context of progressive punitivism, offering an initial and generative sketch of the ideology and its mixed effects. The conclusion offers a modest proposal for a better way to start a bipartisan conversation about gender-based inequities and iniquities, as well as a future agenda for research on progressive punitivism in its other manifestations.</p>

<p>Among the structural elements that enable <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms to durably influence our moods and behaviour, their answering a widespread desire to be liked and accepted - a desire which is seldom transparent to us - greatly increases their manipulative power. So does their ability to harvest fine-grained information about their users (and acquaintances). This data puts such platforms in a position where they can not only covertly influence our thoughts, moods and behaviour: they can do so in a way that is maximally effective given our respective traits, vulnerabilities etc. This paper argues that if we are to stand any chance of taming these platforms’ considerable manipulative potential, some conceptual spring-cleaning is needed.</p>
<p>First, we need to stop confusing regulatory power and regulation. Whereas in mechanics or <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netics there is no need to distinguish between the two -since there are no agents whose <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is infringed by regulation- when the concept of regulation is applied to human behaviour this distinction becomes crucial, and hinges upon the concept of authority. Since <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms do not - yet - claim authority, they do not regulate us: they have regulatory power over us. Our task is to regulate that power.</p>
<p>To succeed in the latter task, we also need to acknowledge that the type of influence exercised by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms is not merely non-deliberative: it is also covert. While the former is often unproblematic from an ethical/legal perspective, the latter not only threatens our right to freedom of thought, it also compromises our commitment to moral equality.</p>

<p>Intrinsic values associated with ICT services activities in productive ageing. Given the advances made in ICT services that have been widely used, elderlies need to be equipped with the knowledge in using the services. The lack of ICT usage among elderlies is because of the low motivation to use the ICT applications. This in turn could be due to the lack of intrinsic values associated with the use of ICT applications among elderlies. This study explores further the features of ICT services needed to support intrinsic values activities. Brainstorming sessions is conducted in this study where it involved six ICT experts in order to identify ICT services features to support intrinsic value activities. Intrinsic motivation features are significant features in ICT services to support intrinsic value activities for productive ageing. There are five intrinsic motivation features identified in this research, which are <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, relatedness, altruism and curiosity. The ICT services to support intrinsic value activities model comprises of the ICT services characteristics that are transactive, community-based with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communication</span> channels, and incorporated with intelligent agents.</p>

<p>Abstract This paper focuses on gender influences on life space mobility based on distance from home traveled by elderly retirees. Consideration of life space travel offers a window into environmental <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and complexity in late life. The gendered nature of time use and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networks have been primarily studied in younger age groups. Our sample included 437 older adults (mean age 83 for both men and women) living in a large Florida retirement community that offered no services. Mean age was 83 for both men and women. Fewer (37.6%) women than men (69.7%) were married and more men drove a car (83% vs 63%).Women reported poorer subjective health and had more IADL limitations. Compared to women, men were significantly more likely to travel long distances. Women’s weekly and monthly travel tended to be local, limited to their neighborhood. On average, respondents of both genders visite</span>d their families and friends out of town every month. Better health, current driving and volunteering were related to longer driving distances for both genders, but these advantages were no longer significant after controlling for demographic characteristics. Our findings underscore the complex relationships between gender and life space travel in late life. Even among elderly men and women of the same age better health and driving resources contribute to larger life space for elderly men.</p>

<p>Abstract Previous work focusing on the relationship between <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use and quality of life among older adults (aged 65+) has found evidence of various positive impacts. This project expands upon this work by examining the relationship between <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use and measures of psychological well-being (PWB) including <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relations with others, purpose in life, and self-acceptance. The analytic sample is derived from two waves of data (Time 1 = 2004, Time 2 = 2011) taken from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study and includes a sample of older adults aged~65 at Time 1 (N = 4943). Participants were separated into four categories: those who did not use the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> at Time 1 or 2, those who used the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> at Time 1 only, those who used the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> at Time 2 only, and those who used the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> at both Time 1 and 2. Regression analyses were performed with the Time 2 PWB measures as the outcomes and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use categories as the primary predictors. Results indicate that while continuous <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> users typically reported higher PWB scores compared to non-users, those who stopped use between Time 1 and 2 also reported higher scores and those who started use between Time 1 and 2 reported lower scores. These results generally held when introducing Time 1 PWB measures as controls, suggesting changes in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use may affect PWB but not necessarily in the predicted directions. Additional control variables, potential explanations, and implications for future research are discussed.</p>

<p>Given the increasing popularity of online game playing, the negative impacts of game addiction on both adolescents and adults attracted our attention. Previous studies based on the self-determination theory have examined the effects of the three basic psychological needs of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness on problematic video game playing among Chinese young adults. Yet, as more evidence emerged pointing to the possible relation between need dissatisfaction and higher vulnerability for ill-being and psychopathology, the present study aimed to incorporate the impacts of both satisfaction and dissatisfaction for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness in explaining <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> gaming disorder (IGD), a condition that may in turn impede eudaimonic well-being as indicated by flourishing. In a self-administered online survey with a valid sample of 1200 Chinese young adults aged 18–24 years (mean age = 19.48 years), the prevalence of probable IGD (for those who reported five or more symptoms in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) symptom list for IGD) was 7.5%. Our results showed that relatedness dissatisfaction positively predicted IGD symptoms after controlling for other need satisfaction and dissatisfaction. Also, flourishing was found to be negatively predicted by IGD. Finally, IGD was found to mediate the effect of relatedness dissatisfaction on flourishing. Our findings suggested a risk factor of relatedness dissatisfaction in predicting IGD, thereby significantly predicting flourishing.</p>

<p>Project overview Teamwork can be defined as dynamic team interaction between two or more interdependent members to achieve a shared goal. Many studies have examined how coordination dynamics are associated with team effectiveness in the context of all-human teams (Gorman, Amazeen, &amp; Cooke, 2010), and later, in human-<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> teams (HAT)s (Demir, Likens, Cooke, Amazeen, &amp; McNeese, 2018). HATs must have autonomous agents that act as effective teammates and help enable HATs to function as collaborative systems. Synergistic relationships among a system’s human and technological components provide the basis for emergent systems-level outcomes. Layered dynamics, a recent empirical modelling technique aimed at achieving this objective (Gorman et al., 2019), considers reorganization of the sociotechnical system across individual components and the overall system. The current study examined layered dynamics of HATs during automation and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> failures and addresses how members of HATs interact with each other and technological aspects of the system. Design and Method We utilized a simulated Remotely Piloted Aircrtaft System (RPAS) Synthetic Task Environment with three heteregeneous and interdepedent roles: (1) a navigator, who created a dynamic flight plan and provided waypoint related information; (2) a pilot, who used this information to monitor and adjust settings. The pilot also communicated with the photographer to negotiate settings and enable proper conditions to obtain a good photograph; and (3) a photographer, who monitored and adjusted the camera to take good target photos, and provided feedback to the team. This study utilized a Wizard of Oz paradigm, in which the navigator and photographer were instructed that the pilot was a synthetic agent. However, the pilot was a highly-trained experimenter, in a separate room, who simulated an autonomous agent using limited vocabulary. There were 22 teams, and two participants were randomly assigned to the navigator and photographer roles. This task was comprised of ten 40-minute missions, and teams needed to take as many good photos as possible while avoiding alarms and rule violations. The primary manipulation was the application of three degraded conditions: (1) automation failure - role-level display failures, (2) <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> failure - autonomous agent’s abnormal behavior, and (3) malicious <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-attacks - the hijaking of the RPAS, with the synthetic agent providing false, detrimental information. We symbolically represented RPAS using layered dynamics, and calculated entropy measures for each (Gorman et al., 2019): (1) communications: team members interacting within the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> system; (2) vehicle: states of the RPA, including airspeed/altitude, turns, fuel, battery, remaining film, and termperature level; and (3) controls: the interface controls between the RPA and the team members. To measure team performance, we used a time and coordination based metric for each target in each mission. Results and Discussion Our main findings were: 1) vehicle and communication entropy were higher than control entropy and were associated with better adaptation to both failures, and 2) control entropy had a negative association with initial status on team performance, while vehicle entropy had a positive association. These findings describe the tendency of low performing teams to anticipate targets poorly. This was due to a failure to interact with the technology in a timely manner. This lagged effect can be attributed to teams taking too long to interact with the technology. These findings shed light on how the layered dynamics approach can help understand team behavior under degraded conditions.
