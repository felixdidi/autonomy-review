<p>Political change doesn’t always begin with a bang; it often starts with just a whisper. From the discussions around kitchen tables that led to the dismantling of the Soviet bloc to the more recent emergence of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> initiatives like MoveOn.org and Redeem the Vote that are revolutionizing the American political landscape, consequential political life develops in small spaces where dialogue generates political power. In The Politics of Small Things, Jeffrey C. Goldfarb provides an innovative way for understanding politics, a way of appreciating the significance of politics at the micro level by comparatively analyzing key turning points and institutions in recent history. He presents a sociology of human interactions that lead from small to large: dissent around the old Soviet bloc; life on the streets in Warsaw, Prague, and Bucharest in 1989; the network of terror that spawned 9/11; and the religious and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> mobilizations that transformed the 2004 presidential election, to name a few. In such pivotal moments, he masterfully shows, political <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> can be generated, presenting alternatives to the big politics of the global stage and the dominant narratives of terrorism, antiterrorism, and globalization.</p>

<p>“Yu Lun Jian Du,” or the Chinese media’s practice of scrutinizing government activity, has become a popular discourse in China. This study stresses that: (1) by institutional arrangement, China’s media are “mouthpieces” of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and their “Yu Lun Jian Du” practice has always been under strict party control; (2) as a media discourse, “Yu Lun Jian Du” helps journalists pursue professional <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> under the premise of conformity to party rules; (3) the emergence of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> affords unprecedented possibilities for free expression, however, it has as yet not subverted China’s established media system. Provided that China’s political system remains intact, the media will remain an organ of the CCP and the practice of “Yu Lun Jian Du” will remain one component of the CCP’s exercise of political power.</p>

<p>This study seeks to discuss plagiarism in the academic context as an act that has increased significantly due to free access to digital hypertexts. Considering that there are texts from diverse fields of knowledge circulating on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>, undergraduate students find it easier to copy than to construct their own authorship. In order to contribute to this discussion, this study intends to reflect on the need to open objective and subjective spaces in the University - the place for the production of language - in order to make construction of authorship effective in the dialectic between the individual and the collective. In this sense, reading and writing practices should be experienced as the motivation for intellectual production, with the intention of providing the student, as a future teacher, with the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> needed to write and to establish him or herself as author, as he or she navigates the digital network.</p>

<p>In its “Philippine Information Society” discourse, the State promotes Filipino service-based ICT skills while condemning other “offensive” and “illegal” activities, such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>sex. This dichotomy fails to capture the complex nature of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>sex phenomenon, and accordingly, the varied lived experiences of individuals in the context of an emergent “Information Society.” We wish to broaden the discursive space by adopting the affective labor perspective and showcasing <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>sex narratives that traverse themes of exploitation, negotiation, resistance, and agency in ICT use. Using two case studies, we illustrate how <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>sex is experienced, organized, mediated, and made meaningful. We also describe how laborers are inscribed in mechanisms of surveillance and control, as they develop counter-measures to compromise, challenge or take advantage of these mechanisms. Our analysis reveals that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>sex laborers create value, not just in monetizing their labor, but also in pursuing <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, personal development, and kinship-oriented care. The lived experiences of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>sex laborers also produce new and potent forms of bio-politics. These multi-faceted narratives problematize the State-sponsored ICT discourse. On one hand, laborers embody the impositions made upon service-based labor by the global digital economy: rudimentary technological skills, the ability to speak English, the ability to empathize and foster customer relations. On the other, their exclusion engendered the refusal to be subjected to the standards and prerequisites of the legitimate, “formal” digital economy. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span>sex’s anomalous position, we contend, is a reflexive by-product of the neoliberal digital economy that puts premium less on ICT for development and more on labor that serves, foremost, ICT for capital.</p>

<p>This study explores social interactive features of synchronous <span style="background-color:lightgreen">computer-mediated</span> communication (CMC)–commonly known as “<span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>”–as such features unfolded in real time and developed over a nine-week period in two fourth-semester college Spanish classes. The study invoked the Vygotskian sociocultural theoretical framework and employed discourse analysis as a research tool to describe and explain outstanding features of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> room communication. Specific interactional features examined are intersubjectivity, off-task discussion, greetings and leave-takings, identity exploration and role play, humor and sarcasm, and use of the L1 (English). Through these communicative behaviors, learners appropriated the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> room environment, transforming it into a learner-centered discourse community governed by communicative <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and the use of language and discourse functions that go beyond those encountered in the typical L2 classroom.</p>

<p>Abstract Socio-<span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>physical networks tightly integrate humans, real-world objects and IT infrastructure. In some cases of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>physical networks, their configuration can be done in a centralized way (e.g., automated production line configuration). However, for socio-<span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>physical networks the centralized control is not possible due to the independence and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the network members (e.g., employees of an enterprise). The paper proposes an approach to model such network via a set of interacting socio-inspired services. Such services are capable to model behavior of the network participants taking into account their preferences, strategies and social norms. The interoperability of the services is achieved due to the usage of common standards (such as WSDL and SOAP) at the technological level, and common ontology at the semantic level. The developed conceptual model of socio-inspired service is presented together with behavior patterns and methods for their processing.</p>

<p>In the digital age, technology is playing an important role in changing the nature of professionalism. Newer forms of professional learning stand in contrast to more traditional forms of professional development. The shifting paradigm has implications for school leaders in all contexts. This study sought to qualitatively examine how a sample of eight school leaders worked to support professional learning in their school communities and leverage tools in areas such as content aggregation, media creation, blogging and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. In one-on-one and focus group interviews, participants discussed how technology is changing professional learning in their context and reflected on how their leadership has evolved in response to perceived challenges. Findings suggest that school leaders are aware of the importance of supporting professional learning through multiple device platforms, online networks and opportunities to play, and experiment with technology.

<p>The article begins from explanation of the meaning (from the point of view of the Orthodox Church) of the word „catholic” as one of the ontological attributes of the Church. Than the author presents the examples of the different kinds of meetings of Church hierarchs on the highest level and its titles/names. Than the article gives a short presentation of the initiative and history of the convene of Pan-Orthodox Council. The idea of that kind of meeting was born in the beginning of XX century on Ecumenical Patriar<span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>e. The preparation to the Pan-Orthodox Council lasts many yearsand contains of many different kind of meetings. Meetings of the special commission that consists of representatives of each Autocephaly Orthodox Church concentrate on the different topics. During last meetings several important topics were discussed, as: Orthodox Diaspora, <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> and the methods of its granting, Autocephaly and the methods of its grantingand Diptychs. The author, who took part in some of these meeting,explains the positions of the various Churches in these matters as well asshares his opinions on them. In conclusion the author presents the opinion that despite many different problems on the way to prepare the Pan-Orthodox Council, this idea can be realized even in the near future.</p>

<p>Today, the emergence of web-based communities and hosted services such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s, wikis and folksonomies, brings in tremendous freedom of web <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing between users. Along with the interaction between users and computers, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> is rapidly becoming an important part of our digital experience, ranging from digital textual information to diverse multimedia forms. These aspects and characteristics constitute of the core of second generation of web. Social networking (SN) and recommender system (RS) are two hot and popular topics in the current Web 2.0 era, where the former emphasises the generation, dissemination and evolution of user relations, and the latter focuses on the use of collective preferences of users so as to provide the better experience and loyalty of users in various web applications. Leveraging user social connections is able to alleviate the common problems of sparsity and cold-start encountered in RS. This paper aims to summarise the research progresses and findings in these two areas and showcase the empowerment of integrating these two kinds of research strengths.</p>

<p>Abstract ‘The art of living with ICTs (<span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies)’ today not only means finding new ways to cope, interact and create new lifestyles on the basis of the new digital (network) technologies individually , as ‘consumer-citizens’. It also means inventing new modes of living, producing and, not in the least place, struggling collectively , as workers and producers. As the so-called digital revolution unfolds in the context of a neoliberal cognitive and consumerist capitalism, its ‘innovations’ are predominantly employed to modulate and control both production processes and consumer behavior in view of the overall goal of extracting surplus value. Today, the digital networks overwhelmingly destroy social <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, instead engendering increasing social heteronomy and proletarianization. Yet it is these very networks themselves, as technical pharmaka in the sense of French ‘technophilosopher’ Bernard Stiegler, that can be employed as no other to struggle against this tendency. This paper briefly explores this possibility by reflecting upon current diagnoses of our ‘technological situation’ by some exemplary post-operaist Marxists from a Stieglerian, pharmacological perspective.</p>

<p>This research looks at how the structural characteristics of network affect pressure of relational inertia and the behavior to share information through SNS. Also, we tested the moderating effect of the structural <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in network, the extent to which a user feels that ties of relationship can be managed in terms of holding important hubs in social network. The data were collected through online survey from 320 members of four <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>ies of two popular SNS, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> and KakaoStory. The findings show that first of all, three out of four constructs we studied as a structural characteristic, cohesiveness, multiplexity, and syncopated complexity had positive impact on relational inertia, and also relational inertia was positively associated with the decrease of information sharing on SNS. Second, the users’ structural <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> on SNS made the decrease of information sharing weaker and also moderated the relationship between relational inertia and decrease of information sharing. This study suggests that even SNS, which enables the relationship building and information sharing through social networking, could bring negative effect depending on the structural characteristics of a user’s social network. In this study, we also confirmed the value of structural <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> on SNS. Actors can benefit from being linked to only the important ties on social network to obtain effective information and social capital from relationships.</p>

<p>Today journalistic production takes place within “editorial offices” or “newsrooms”. But such newsrooms did not exist when newspapers first emerged. This paper describes, based primarily on the evidence of building structure and architectural floor plans, when and why special newsrooms were created in Germany and how they developed. At first these rooms were small, and journalists often resided there too. From the late nineteenth century editorial offices became differentiated and, in the German case typically became separate rooms reflecting newspapers’ different editorial subjects and sections, thereby fostering their journalistic <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Only recently can changes towards alternative structures and open-plan offices be observed. Meanwhile the production of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> news returns to an organization that does not require a newsroom. This paper argues that newsroom structure has influenced journalism in Germany, which did not change its production routines much after World War II when the American journal…</p>

<p>This article proposes a multiliteracies-based pedagogical framework for the analysis of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">computer-mediated</span> discourse (CMD) in order to give students increased access to expanded discourse options that are available in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communication</span> environments and communities (i.e., beyond the classroom). Through the analysis of excerpts and a corpus of French and Spanish electronic discourse, we illustrate how this framework can promote autonomous, lifelong participation and learning emphasized by the Communities component of the National Standards. Such an analysis allows students and instructors to explore similarities and divergences within and among different types of CMD and, by extension, more traditional types of discourse that are all shaped by technical and social affordances and constraints.</p>

<p>In new generation social networks, we expect that the paradigm of Social <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>working Systems (SISs) will become progressively more important. Indeed, the possibility of interconnecting users and resources of different social networks enables a lot of strategic applications whose main strength is the integration of different communities that nevertheless preserves their diversity and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. In this new scenario, the role of Social Network Analysis is crucial in studying the evolution of structures, individuals, interactions, and so on, and in extracting powerful knowledge from them. But the preliminary step to do is designing a good way to crawl the underlying graph. Although this aspect has been deeply investigated in the field of social networks, it is an open issue when moving towards SISs. Indeed, we cannot expect that a crawling strategy, specifically designed for social networks, is still valid in a Social <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>working Scenario, due to its specific topological features. In this paper, we confirm the above claim, giving a strong motivation for our second contribution, which is the definition of a new crawling strategy. This strategy, specifically conceived for SISs, is shown to fully overcome the drawbacks of the state-of-the-art crawling strategies.</p>

<p>This article examines the articulation of sibiriak identity in the early 21st century. This time is particularly important because the current Russian government has made a point of curtailing the regional <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the Yeltsin years. Drawing on regional news sources, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> blogs, and writings by prominent Siberian public intellectuals, this article delineates a number of specifically Siberian voices and the concerns they discuss in the public sphere. It argues that contemporary Siberian identity differs significantly from stereotypical European Russian constructions of Siberian identity that equate simple goodness and honesty with the broad Siberian terrain. This material shows a diverse range of opinions and attitudes, a concerted effort to keep the Siberian heritage before the public eye, and a sustained discussion about the usable past. Focusing particularly on Evgenii Grishkovets’s autobiographical novella, Rivers (Reki, 2005), this article examines the emergence of a post-Soviet discourse that reaches beyond Siberian stereotypes and openly expresses social and cultural problems encountered by Siberians.</p>

<p>Socio-technical networks are based on knowledge building and information sharing. The power and alternative to control over self-representation on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking Web site</span>s brings certain <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to an individual and, as a result, has an impact on the style of the exchange. Some of the specific objectives of the study are to study the emerging style of socio-technical exchange and to identify the characteristics of an emerging socio-technical society. This study found that social identity, social exchange, and social vicinity are the key characteristics of the emerging socio-technical exchange. A gradual paradigm shift from traditional societies to knowledge-based societies was observed. While, on one hand, a high dependency and usage of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking Web site</span>s was observed, on the other hand, the level of trust and dependency between the community members was found to be diminishing.</p>

<p>In their studies of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online media</span>, political economists of communication have examined how firms like Google enclose users in a web of commercial surveillance, thus facilitating the commodification of their online labor. However, this focus on enclosure tends to overlook the political possibilities highlighted by autonomist Marxist theory—namely, that users, under certain circumstances, can appropriate these applications to contest conditions of exploitation. This article offers an analysis of Blog Cabin 2008, a cable home improvement show, in order to explore this tension between <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and enclosure. Our findings suggest that producers indeed used the show’s blog to exploit fans’ free labor. However, fans also used the blog to form social bonds, to press demands on the show’s producers, and to make connections between the show’s class politics and the wider financial crisis. A concluding section explores the theoretical and political significance of such unanticipated uses of the show’s blog.</p>

<p>This article reviews the recent literature on uses, effects, and gratifications of media during emerging adulthood. We examine traditional media forms, including television, films, video games, music, and books, and also newer media, such as cell phones, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s, and other <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use. We find that emerging adults spend more time using the media than they spend doing any other activity, with the most time being spent on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and listening to music. We also find that exposure to certain types of media content can influence both positive and negative outcomes in emerging adulthood, including, aggressive and prosocial behavior, body image, sexual behavior, friendship quality, and academic achievement. We also show that emerging adults use the media to gratify certain needs; key among these are for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, identity, and intimacy needs. Finally, we discuss areas for future research involving media and emerging adulthood.</p>

<p>This study uses network analysis to examine <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span>’s level of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> from external influences, being the political and the media field. The conceptual framework builds upon Bourdieu’s field theory, appropriated on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> as mediated social spaces. The study investigates conversation patterns on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span> between political, media and citizen agents during election times in Belgium. Through the comparison of conversational practices with the positions users hold as political, media or citizen agents, we understand how the former is related to the latter. The analysis of conversation patterns (based on replies and mentions) shows a decentralized and loosely knit network, in which primarily citizen agents are present. Nonetheless, the prominence of citizens in the debate, mentions or replies to political and media agents are significantly higher, placing them more centrally in the network. In addition, politicians and media actors are closely connected within the network, and reciprocal communication of these established agents is significantly lower compared to citizen agents. We understand different aspects of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> related to the presence, positions and practices of the agents on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span> and their relative positions as politicians, media or citizens. To conclude, we discuss the promises of Bourdieu’s relational sociology and the limitations of our study. The approach proposed here is an attempt to integrate existing work and evolve towards a systematic understanding of the interrelations between political, media and citizen agents in a networked media environment.</p>

<p>The study examines the influence of national culture on national averages of time spent (ATS) visiting the largest <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s (SNSs): <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span>, and LinkedIn. The analysis uses cultural dimensions adopted from both the works of Hofstede and Schwartz, while controlling for country e-readiness and median population age. The findings suggest that culture’s influence may be moderated by the media richness and type of network focus of each SNS. Overall, in rich-media SNSs, egalitarianism positively impacts ATS. Individualism and masculinity only impact ATS on friendship-oriented SNSs. Additionally, uncertainty avoidance and intellectual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> only impact ATS on professional-oriented SNSs.</p>

<p>This paper deals with the issue of surveillance as it applies to recent technological advancements. Specifically, advancements in video capturing and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> have made public events into spectacles that are observed and shared online by the public. Public protest and discourse loosens itself from the bounds of state authority and enters the arena of the public. This phenomenon reconsiders Foucault’s conception of the panopticon. Foucault’s panopticon is useful as a tool for understanding the way power operates through surveillance in a state-to-public direction, but technological advancements have allowed for a reversal of this surveillance. With real examples like the pepper spraying of student protesters at UC Davis, the public now has surveillance over the state (in this example police officers) from its multitude of citizen perspectives that can be shared and disseminated online. This is an important development because it increases the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and safe power of individuals who wish to speak out against excessive use of power by the state over the public. People can do so without fear of greater police suppression of real events. Issues with this development are discussed, like the chance for the state, or other sites of power (like corporations) to develop the copyrighting of public pace, making any event the property of power structures. This would be a problem, as it would lessen the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of individuals in public</p>

<i> Anastasia Kavada </i></p>
<p>Decentralized and internally diverse, the Global Justice Movement (GJM) is thought to be influenced by its use of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>. Operating in an environment characterized by the conditions of globalization and late modernity, the movement strives to be a collective that accommodates individual difference. Focusing on the organizing process of the European Social Forum, this article examines the role of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> lists and physical meetings in realizing this ‘unity in diversity’. Based on interviews with movement activists and a content analysis of three <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> lists, this article examines how online and face-to-face communication practices engender different dynamics in terms of individuality and collectiveness. While communication on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> lists tends to afford divergence, diversity, and individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, face-to-face contact enables convergence, unity and the affirmation of the collective. Thus, it is the combination of those two modes of communication that helps the movement to fuse seemingly opposing dynamics.</p>

<p>The rapid growth in usage of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s begs a reconsideration of the meaning of mediated political participation in society. Castells (2009) contended that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s offer a form of mass communication of the self wherein individuals can acquire a new creative <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Stiegler (2009) and the Ars Industrialis collective believe that the processes of individuation, and of speaking out, hold the key to empowerment, agency, and resistance. In this article the authors offer a critical reflection on the logic of mediated participation promoted by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> through a consideration of the differences between individual and collective forms of mediated political participation. Drawing on ethnographic research on alternative media within the Trade Union Movement in Britain and recent research on the political culture of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s, the authors argue that far from being empowering, the logic of self-centered participation promoted by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> can represent a threat for political groups rather than an opportunity.</p>

<p>This paper examines ways in which the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and alternative forms of media have been employed to enhance political struggle in contemporary society, and are in fact redefining political struggle. It uses a case study of Nike Corporation to highlight that although the power and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of transnational corporations operating within the global economy has been enhanced over the past few decades, there are accompanying modes of grassroots organizing which foster globalized resistance to such hegemonic tendencies. The analysis argues that the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> provides the resources and environment necessary for cohesive organized resistance to corporate culture across the domains of production (labor issues) and consumption issues (marketing). The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and independent media have facilitated organizing strategies among emerging new social movements, such as the anti-sweatshop movement and the Culture Jammers movement.

<p>The paper examines Australian Indymedia collectives as a means to improve understanding of the practices of alter-globalisation movements. Two key issues are explored. The first concerns the politics of the alter-globalisation movements—what they demand and how they practise their aims. The second concerns the potential of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICTs) to provide a space within which to build a radical politics. Several dilemmas facing Indymedia and alter-globalisation movements emerge from this analysis. First, there remain many limitations of using ICTs as a space for the constitution of a radical politics. Second, Indymedia collectives have had success in aligning their aims to their practices; however, informal hierarchies did form around editorial decisions and technical skills. Third, there is continued potential for these movements to appear exclusive. In this respect, simply being ‘open’ is not enough to widen these spaces of resistance. Fourth, there is the continued importanc…</p>

<p>This study employs a relational dialectics approach to gain insights into the nature of relational communication via Cyworld, a Korean <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social network site</span>. Qualitative analysis of in-depth interview data from 49 users suggests that Cyworld users routinely negotiate multiple dialectical tensions that are created within the online world, transferred from face-to-face contexts, or imposed by interpersonal principles that relate to Korea’s collectivistic culture. The interviewees experienced a new relational dialectic of interpersonal relations versus self-relation, analogous to Baxter and Montgomery’s 1996 connection-<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> contradiction. Their responses suggest that Cyworld’s design features and functions encourage users to transcend the high-context communication of Korean culture by offering an alternative channel for elaborate and emotional communication, which fosters the reframing of relational issues offline. Cy-Ilchons online buddies virtually extend the Korean cultural concept of blood ties, called yons, in ways that intensify the openness-closedness contradiction at early stages of relationship formation.</p>

<p>The existing critical literature on constructions of childhood and parenthood is only beginning to listen to what parents have to say. As a result, parents may paradoxically be viewed as passive victims and therefore reduced to be the spectators of what is supposed to be their ‘problem’. The present study analyses dominant parent advice texts in the Flemish community of Belgium, as well as the voices of parents on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. The study confirms the tendencies noticed in critical literature: the tendency to individualize responsibilities and the focus on <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the neoliberal era. In addition it unveils the double bind nature of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in expert discourse. It also illustrates the performative agency of parents, as co-constructors of dominant discourse as well as contesting this discourse. In so doing, the study complements the existing vein of literature with the way in which parents think of and experience the dominant parenting discourse.</p>

<p>Whilst some authors have portrayed the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> as a powerful tool for business and political institutions, others have highlighted the potential of this technology for those vying to constrain or counter-balance the power of organizations, through e-collectivism and on-line action. What appears to be emerging is a contested space that has the potential to simultaneously enhance the power of organizations, whilst also acting as an enabling technology for the empowerment of grass-root networks. In this struggle, organizations are fighting for the retention of “old economy” positions, as well as the development of “new economy” power-bases. In realizing these positions, organizations and institutions are strategizing and manoeuvering in order to shape on-line networks and communications. For example, the on-line activities of individuals can be contained through various technological means, such as surveillance, and the structuring of the virtual world through the use of portals and “walled gardens”. However, loose groupings of individuals are also strategizing to ensure there is a liberation of their communication paths and practices, and to maintain the potential for mobilization within and across traditional boundaries. In this article, the unique nature and potential of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> are evaluated, and the struggle over this contested virtual space is explored.</p>

<p>This article explores professional learning through online discussion events as sites of communities of learning. The rise of distributed work places and networked labour coincides with a privileging of individualised professional learning. Alongside this focus on the individual has been a growth in informal online learning communities and networks for professional learning and professional identity development. An example of these learning communities can be seen in the synchronous discussion events held on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span>. This article examines a sample of these events where the interplay of personal learning and the collaborative components of professional learning and practice are seen, and discusses how facilitation is performed through a distributed assemblage of technologies and the collective of event participants. These <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span> based events demonstrate competing forces of newer technologies and related practices of social and collaborative learning against a rhetoric of learner <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and control found in the advocacy of the personalisation of learning.</p>

<p>This paper analyzes how mainstream, online news organizations understand press <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in their relationships to audiences. I situate the press in terms of neo-institutional sociology, seeing its <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> as a distributed, field-level phenomenon involving boundary work among distributed actors. I then trace press-audience relations through two historical examples letters to the editor and ombudsmen, showing how the press has historically both separated itself from and relied upon audiences. Examining eight news organizations’ <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> policies, I analyze the inside-out and outside-in forces through which the press distinguishes itself from audiences, concluding with a discussion of how such guidelines structure the types of control that news organizations have, or might have, as they use <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social network site</span>s in their news work.</p>

<p>In the globally networked world, strange, unexpected, and sometimes amusing events occur. This article analyzes one such happening with the purpose of understanding how the global communication system affects national cultures. It is the author’s hypothesis that the current state of globalization, of which the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> is a major component, imposes a new and heightened level of interaction between cultures. This interactivity changes each culture in many ways, one of which the article highlights: the degree of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of each culture is significantly reduced as a consequence of the global information network.</p>

<p>This research wants to identify the factors that impact the use of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s for knowledge exchange based on the open and sparse structure of virtual communities.

<p>In this essay, Foucault’s concept “of other spaces” – or, heterotopia – is used to examine the Occupy Wall Street (OWS) movement in the context of systemic crisis. Neoliberalism is marked by innovations that amplify and accelerate contradictions, unfolding the false utopia of finance capitalism. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICTs) helped hyper-financialize the economy, enrich banksters and extend inequalities. Conversely, high-tech developments allow for decentralized decision-making and more direct democracy, paralleling the ethics of OWS. New ICTs compress TimeSpace, opening doors for empathic connections, generating conditions for elevation of collective superstructural consciousness. This paper explores how these conditions create – and are recreated by – heterotopic spaces. Drawing on Foucault’s method of heterotopology we throw light on the potential of OWS to prefigure another world, analyzing endeavors to promote cooperative <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and raise consciousness in and through mediated environments, always contested, ever in flux, and inevitably over-(but never pre-)determined.</p>

<p>Campaigns are strategic contests between candidates and reporters. While candidates have proven to be adept at gaming news coverage of their campaign advertisements, journalists have maintained their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> by curtailing coverage of the candidates’ stump speeches. The advent of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online media</span>, however, advantages the candidates by permitting direct communication between candidates and voters. Author Notes: Shanto Iyengar holds the Chandler Chair in Communication at Stanford University, where he is also a professor of political science. Ever since primary elections replaced conventions as the principal means of nominating candidates, the relationship between journalists and candidates has been critical to understanding the conduct of American political campaigns. Each side has clearly defined and conflicting objectives. Candidates covet the free and “objective” publicity provided by news reports. Reporters, for their part, are motivated to maintain their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> by debunking campaign rhetoric and “spin.” In the ensuing tussle over whose voice is to be heard, which side comes out ahead? Writing in 1993, well before the dawn of modern, technology-driven campaigns, Ansolabehere, Iyengar, and Behr gave the nod to the candidates and their handlers. The relationship between political figures and the media has changed dramatically since the advent of television. Politicians have been much quicker to adjust to these changes than the media. Elected officials, candidates, and their consultants have developed intricate strategies for using or evading the media to their advantage. The media, on the other hand, have only just begun to develop counterstrategies for protecting their independence. Elected officials are adept at inducing reporters to cover their activities in the best possible light. Reporters don’t always know how they’re being manipulated, and if they do, they don’t always know how to stop it. (234) If candidates had the superior game in the 1980s, there is a compelling case to be made that recent changes in the campaign environment have only strengthened their hand. In this essay, I update the strategic dance between candidates and the press in the area of the two main forms of campaign communication: paid advertising and “free” news coverage.</p>

<p>The Arab atheist community is largely an online phenomenon, with limited visibility offline and with virtually no umbrella groups. It exists in unfriendly, if not hostile, political, social, religious, and legal environments. This paper aims to deepen our understanding of virtual space by analyzing the Arab atheist community online: its content, discourse, and structure. The research examines the relationship between the networked information economy and the emergence of religious skeptics as manifested in Arab <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>space. A central question is whether the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> enhances individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in matters of faith. Given that the Arab atheist community online is prevailingly anonymous, the paper assesses the potential and limitations of anonymous and pseudonymous speech online and the extent to which this facilitates or hinders sharing, debating, community building, and collective action.</p>

<p>More than any other form of online activity, the practices of online information search have been overwhelmingly associated with their straightforward utility and with the potential alterations in the socio-economic structure that the access to this information, or lack thereof, entails. However, even when afforded such an apparently instrumental role, several important elements of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> are based on, and oriented towards, culture, identity and collectivity, and relate to a symbolically un-fragmented system that remains largely unconscious. In this paper we appropriate the concept of ontological security to explore the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the cultural dimension of online search, which has gone largely unanalysed in the literature. Ontological security is the unconscious sense that individuals have about the continuity and order in events related to their lives. At the collective level, it relates to the stability of the symbolic structures of society, which are both inclusive and exclusionary. Through a se…</p>

These campaigns sought to influence journalists in direct and indirect ways, and planned their strategic communication efforts around political events such as debates well in advance. Despite these similarities, staffers cite that Obama’s campaign had much greater ability to respond in real time to unfolding commentary around political events given an organizational structure that provided digital staffers with a high degree of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. After analyzing the ways staffers discuss effective communication on the platform, this article argues that at extraordinary moments campaigns can exercise what Isaac Reed calls “performative power,” influence over other actors’ definitions of the …</p>

<p>This article examines German print sport journalists’ perceptions, experiences, and relationships with Bundesliga clubs’ public relations (PR) staffers and each club’s designated press spokesperson, as well the impact of a competitive, multitier 21st-century media environment on their jobs. All Bundesliga clubs are now disseminating more multimedia content on their own through official Web sites and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span> and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>. Meanwhile, the German newspaper industry is in a state of transformation and decreased prominence among mediums in German sport journalism. A survey of print journalists who cover Bundesliga clubs showed that these changes have affected the historic symbiotic relationship between the sporting press and Bundesliga clubs. Power and media <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> have increased for Bundesliga clubs and their designated press spokespersons, while print reporters are more dependent on the clubs’ PR staffers to provide access. The surveyed journalists recognize the increasing power of television in German sport journalism, but nearly half do not consider this as negative for their jobs. These print sport journalists are called on to find new ways and types of media content to begin restoring the needed balance in a symbiotic relationship between independent press and PR, while also distinguishing their work from televised media content.</p>

<p>The professional use and implementation of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> or <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> related applications are booming. Solutions like business internal communities promise to connect employees in a more flexible way than old-fashioned mailing lists or static network drives ever could. New solutions are perceived to support communication independent from time and space and in allow a more flexible way of communicating direct as well as indirect through the offer of different communication media (<span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>, voice over IP, mail, blog, etc.). But in contrast to remarkably good application scenarios, reality is not keeping up. Therefore more investigations of usage conditions and acceptance parameters are needed to find out which showstoppers interfere with a successful implementation. Due to the fact that acceptance by future users is one core condition for a successful implementation of software within operational structures and processes, this paper presents a study with focus on motivational issues to use business communities depending on diversity factors. In this study the focus is set on the diversity factors age, gender, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> expertise, achievement motivation, and perceived locus of control over technology (ploc). First results revealed that the classical user diversity variables age and gender do not influence the motives to use business communities. In contrast technology related diversity factors and achievement motivation revealed correlations with usage motives (r &gt; .3). The most important motives were the need for information and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Achievement motivation showed the strongest correlation with the need for social interaction (r = .51), indicating that highly motivated people can be motivated to use a SNS if it facilitates social interaction.</p>

<p>The concept of identity is a multiform notion. Many authors have addressed it from Psychology to Sociology, Anthropology and Cultural Studies. Historically we find first an identification with the gods, the earth and blood. In Modernity, the individual is separated from its community and its original circumstances, developing a higher degree of individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. In our present mediatized societies, reality is not only mediated by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies, but also recreated through virtual technologies and thus deductible to equations, data and information. This process is reshaping our identities, which have suffered transformations imposed by the shock and the juxtaposition between the process of globalization and local cultures, distorting mechanisms of cultural identification, models, values and styles. As a conclusion, we present three ‘dimensions’ in which identity processes are built: referential, inter-referential and selfreferential. Finally, we ask ourselves what Nietzsche did 100 years ago: “is that which I am, that, for you, I am no longer? Is that what ‘I am’, that, for you, I am not? Is it that I have become another? Am I a stranger to myself?</p>

<p>This article follows up the study of “moral structures” present in poetry as a cultural practice, inquiring about the role it plays in the self-understanding and self-determination of a political community that aspires to be democratic. It will proceed by arguing that Benjamin Barber’s republicanism deserves to be reconsidered in the light of the current trivialization and acceleration of politics by means of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies (ICT). A reinterpretation of the poetics present in Barber’s “political talk” might be interesting to the theory of deliberative democracy, specially in relation to the concept of “deliberation within” by Robert Goodin (2010) and the defense of the role emotions play in political life by Martha Nussbaum (2013). After stressing the importance of two endangered capabilities –attentive listening and slow reading–, the article concludes that poetry might be an emancipatory cultural practice within the enlightenment-romantic program that strives for mutually educating the reason, the sensibility, and the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of citizens.</p>

<p>With the development and popularity of computer network technology,the right protection of the citizen’s <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> or intangible private space has become more and more prominent.On the other hand,the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of private space as provided in the prevailing constitution refers only to the tangible assets — houses,leaving out the intangible private space — network.The citizen’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of private space ought to be explicitly stipulated in the constitution,which should involve both tangible spaces like residence or communication and intangible space like network.To make consummate the citizen’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of private space,we should enlarge the range of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in Constitution,establish the open and progressive legislation pattern for basic rights,and make definite the legal contents of private space <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.</p>

<p>Abstract Successful <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> networks motivate people to engage in behaviors that speak to their most basic psychological needs through citizenship in a virtual society. These environments provide individuals with the ability to build relationships (relatedness), exercise competence, and express <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Recipes for satisfying these basic needs are vital to the success of virtual societies. This research contributes to existing literature by framing <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> interaction using the self-determination theory (SDT); the study analyzes a sample of 570 social networking participants using the generations of baby boomers, generation X, and millennials with fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). Findings indicate that affinity, belonging, interactivity, and innovativeness are all base expectations for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> networking usage, depending on the generational cohort. Indeed, understanding the motivational needs of unique generational cohorts allows marketers to more effectively design precise adaptive strategies for their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, which can impact engagement and thereby loyalty.</p>

<p>In the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> society,the power of the traditional legitimizing identity declines and requirements for the evaluation of social identity are much higher. The <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the construction of social identity has become more prominent. As resistance identity and project identity rise,legitimizing identity is under challenge. Construction of social identity in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> society is a process of organizing different meanings and values,among which ideology occupies a central position. In the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> society,ideology has shifted from a rational type to a perceptual one,therefore perceptual ideology occupies a central position in the construction of social identity. Perceptual ideology,rooted in the human heart,empowers social identity on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>,which is reflected by the power hidden in the grass-roots society.</p>

They have so permeated young lives that it is hard to believe that less than a decade ago these technologies barely existed. Today’s youth are struggling for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and identity as did their predecessors, but they are doing so amid new worlds for communication, friendship, play, and self-expression. This paper seeks to provide empirical data on the impact of the mobile technology on the social life of Indian youth. Taking a survey of some 1200 young Indians, the paper discovers their dependency on this new medium.</p>

<p>Recent studies on digital social networks have analyzed their role as part of collective action and their use during electoral campaigns. Based on a study of the Chilean student movement during the 2013 electoral campaign in that country, the article offers an analysis of how <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> is used by the three student federations that make up the movement. The results suggest informative and organizational aspects take priority in the use of social networks in that context. This trend is mediated by the peculiarities of the movement – the presence of traditional student organizations – and by and the complexity of the relationship with institutional policy, particularly the defense of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> against the risks of cooptation, increased by the passage of former leaders of the movement to the latter. The inclination for these spaces to be used more and more at times of increased social mobilization is confirmed, and the tensions between their use by organized collective action (student federations) and by the individuals participating in that action are shown.DOI: 10.5294/pacla.2016.19.3.6</p>

<p>This article recalls the main steps of a « psychotherapy by virtual » of a young psychotic teenager. In this article, we will see how the use of a computer game proves to be a vector of a first transference address from the psychotic to the clinician. Therefore, the virtual will be studied through the magnifying glass of the pathology, revealing a function of « emergence » specific to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netics. This function is triple. Firstly, this contingency loads the emergence promises, allowing the user to expect from the machine anything but, and much more than, it is able to deliver. Secondly, this emergence gives the machine the appearance of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, which helps the patient to delude himself into not considering himself as the origin of his representations. Lastly, this generator of representations enables the symptom by giving it a form, thus processing what Freud called a « force of healing drive » preparing the way for a transference relation.</p>

We take a qualitative methodology as the basic strategy to approach the knowledge of the public and the stakeholders. We carry out a critical theoretical review based on secondary sources.</p>

<p>Over the past decade, the frequency of terror attacks around the world has increased. In the context of the 22 July 2011 terror attacks in Norway, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use by citizens, and even victims, became an essential feature of reporting. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social media</span> confronted the legacy media’s way of covering crisis events. It raised questions about traditional journalism’s ability to handle audience’s as, not only news consumers, but also producers. In the present article, we look at the ways in which the professional norms and values of traditional journalism are specifically challenged by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use in times of terror, using the 22 July 2011 attacks as a case study. We find that Norwegian journalists initially held to their professional roles, and to the classic self-representational principles of journalism, including objectivity, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and immediacy. When they integrated <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> into their traditional platforms and modes of coverage, they framed it as a “source” of sorts.

<p>This essay details the results of fifty-four open-ended interview questionnaires with university-level communication students from eleven countries, exploring the opportunities and challenges for journalism and news in participatory democracy. The study participants were enrolled in a three-week summer global media literacy program, at the end of which they were asked to complete an open-ended survey questionnaire, asking about the role digital media technologies and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms have on journalism and its role in a participatory democracy. Results highlight a general negativity toward the growing influence of new media technologies in journalism with regard to objectivity, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, balance, and depth, juxtaposed with the embrace of the same technologies in contributing to greater citizen participation, voice, and inclusion in journalism and news flow. This divide raises questions around the relationship between journalism, journalism education, and technology in the context of participatory citizenship. The study concludes by recommending a more integrative model for journalism education than presently followed that addresses the disjuncture evidenced in this study between professional notions of journalism and participatory citizenship in the digital age.</p>

<p>The role of the new media&nbsp;in agenda setting in BelarusVictor Martinovich SummaryThe author starts with defining the nature of the political regime that acts in Belarus, providing a list of the key features that are important for media behaviour. The list is extracted from the relevant comparative researches focused on Belarus. After describing the regime as a set of rules for the media, the text then proceeds to the specific morphology of the Belarussian new media that do not comply with the basic characteristics proposed by media researchers and thus can be recognized as old media restructured to meet the ethics and principles of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. Then the author deals with the agenda setting process in Belarus and proposes his own interpretation of the classical logistics of this process in specific Belarussian circumstances where the list of power-bearing actors is dramatically reduced. The paper is finalized with showing the new possibilities that the media as an actor of public policy have obtained in the agenda setting after appearance of Web 2.0 when sites the have been&nbsp;re-structured on the basis of the user-generated content which helps to retrieve the media’s <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and possibilities to influence the agenda setting.Key words: public policy theory, new media, agenda-setting process, political regimes</p>

The methodology is based on in-depth interviews with 15 Spanish journalists from different professional profiles and roles. The findings allow to identify and conceptualise the four basic strategies used to meld the image they project to their social audience. These strategies are positioning, content curation, personalization and specialisation. This study also allows to set the main skills and resources associated with each strategy. Furthermore, an optimistic view about the benefits of personal brand on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span> is detected.

<p>The vertiginous evolution of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICT) and the advent of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> propitiated the emergence of a networked society marked by deep changes in the economy, stimulating the emergence of new paradigms, models, educational communication processes and new learning scenarios. It is precisely one of these models – a pedagogical model to deconstruct moving pictures-, that we intend to analyze, describing its impact on the academic self-concept of twenty-four graduate students, based on the qualitative analysis of their own perceptions and narratives. The results show that these pedagogical model environments – whose design is anchored in the principles of socio-constructivism, collaborative learning, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, flexibility and interaction – may have very positive effects on the academic self-concept of higher education students in the various dimensions taken into consideration: Motivation, task Orientation, Confidence in their own capacities and Relationship with colleagues.

<p>In this article, I apply Bourdieu’s field theory to research on the trajectories, strategies and relations of sources and journalists. I argue that the relational emphasis of field theory, modified by the concept of media meta-capital, can be a fruitful way of examining the social context in which representations of Muslims are produced. This advances scholarship that relies too heavily on content analysis to support judgements about news representations of Muslims. I use examples from original fieldwork in Glasgow to discuss the capital, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and heteronomy of Muslim sources who are ‘authorised knowers’ and ‘new entrants’ in their source communities. These various positions are evident in their relative success in managing journalist–source relations, which encompass ‘legacy’ media platforms and emerging communication tools such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span>. The field theory perspective exposes relations that contribute to the work of representation but are invisible to other forms of analysis.</p>

While the “official” Sanders organization built applications to transform supporters into a tightly controlled distribution network for its <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> messaging, this was complemented by “unofficial” grassroots networks that circulated more informal and culturally oriented appeals. The latter are classified according to the models of organizationally enabled and self-organized connective action in digital social movements, with structural differences in oversight and moderation that suggest varying levels of creative <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for citizens and reputational risk for the associated campaigns.</p>

<p>This article is aimed at presenting a complex approach to the media <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> concept, with particular focus on the most real aspects of journalistic activity and the factors affecting them. The paper actualizes the notion of media and professional <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, introduces the Western tradition of journalistic culture and considers the decisions being made and how they affect professional independence in Lithuanian newsrooms. The practical research part of this piece mostly focuses on newsrooms operating online. Based on the findings of the research conducted on the relationships of business and government structures with the media, and the data of the survey of editors and journalists, it can be stated that several factors affect the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of newsrooms and journalists of Lithuanian <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> portals: 1) the owners of a media outlet; 2) the political and business interests of the owners; 3) an absence of ethical norms, such as documents regulating professional activities; 4) an absence of mechanisms for feedback and resolution of conflicts of interests; 5) a lack of transparency and impartiality in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> portals; 6) political and business interests; 7) the hierarchical structure of an editorial office. An analysis of the information about owners and documents published in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> portals revealed that the editorial offices either do not provide any information about the shareholders (owners) altogether or this information is provided to the general public in a laconic and sleek manner. Regardless of the fact that some of the portals provide information that shareholders do not interfere with the work of the editorial office, none of them referred to a mechanism for dissociating the editorial office from the interests of the owners (shareholders). The portals do not provide information about the mechanisms for resolving conflicts (between the readers and the newsroom) operated in the newsrooms. Moreover, there is no information on how the conflicts of editors and journalists pertaining to professional ethics are resolved. The majority of newsrooms (except for Delfi.lt) do not familiarize readers with their work culture. The survey of the journalists and editors of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> media outlets revealed that the newsrooms are not sufficiently autonomous – the majority of those surveyed do not think they work in autonomous newsrooms. The lack of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of newsrooms of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> portals was also corroborated by the fact that there are topics avoided by journalists and editors alike. Generally, they are associated with competitors, politicians or business structures, advertising customers and the interests of owners. It can be assumed, based on the corpus of the replies given by editors and journalists, that a strong hierarchical structure prevails in editorial offices influencing the individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of journalists. The overall analysis of the journalist replies shows that the journalists do not complete the texts themselves (texts are corrected; titles are changed). Although the corrections are coordinated with the journalists, the editors make the final decision concerning them. Moreover, the lack of professional <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the journalists is also shown by the fact that journalists are commissioned to write articles, whereas certain articles are removed from the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> space.</p>

<p>With the increasing penetration of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> in India, citizen journalism has experienced a steady growth in recent years. This paper adds to the growing scholarship on citizen journalism by exploring the motivations of Indian citizen journalists to produce online news content. Through a Web-based survey of citizen journalists (N = 134) contributing to the leading news portals in India, this study addresses the role of traditional media experience among citizen journalists’ reporting practices. One of the key findings of this study is that, unlike American citizen journalists, Indian citizen journalists who have not worked in traditional media are less likely to work collaboratively than those with traditional media experience.</p>

<p>In this research, we examine the advocacy and community building of transgender women on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span> through methods of network and discourse analysis and the theory of networked counterpublics. By highlighting the network structure and discursive meaning making of the #GirlsLikeUs network, we argue that the digital labor of trans women, especially trans women of color, represents the vanguard of struggles over self-definition.

<p>Petitions can be defined as specific demands on government institutions signed by citizens. On the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, this kind of participation has developed new possibilities in relation with the administration feedback, accessibility and flexibility or cost savings, for example (Juris, 2005). In essentially Anglo- Saxon countries, political powers have developed platforms to manage this form of participation, such as the Scottish Parliament, the Bundestag, or Norwegian municipalities (Lindner &amp; Riehm, 2011). However, in Spain these initiatives have had to be channeled through private alternatives. The aim of this paper is to explore the relationship between Change.org, which is one of these sites, to define its operation and confront the formal features of each of the models. To achieve these goals, we performed a qualitative content analysis of the website of Change.org. We analyze the process of creating and signing petitions, the discussion forums, the structure of the home page and the user possibilities to contact the members of the page. The results of the field work show different results on Change regarding public platforms of e-petitions. Thus, this tool for petitions noted for its simple design and its instructions and user guides that facilitate quick and easy participation by users. However, limited spaces of deliberation and scanty possibilities of contact with Change.org team and users distance the page to a public model of online petitions.</p>

<p>Based on the mini-public theory, this paper examines the mobile <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> public platform in the countryside of western China, and sees it as the public sphere of digital community. The research considers that the public sphere of this kind of digital community transforms the “Half acquaintance society” into “acquaintances society” and constructs the rural endogenous order. Its essence is the new media empower the village elite outside the system to form a social-media-based alliance, and with the village idle staff, left-behind women and other people to form the media self-organizing, become a new village endogenous power. The elite alliance of outside institutions, through express in the public sphere, media mobilization, public action, and so on, connected the scattered in different space of “atomic” villagers, promote the development of rural society. With the change of the village power structure, the elite alliance of the outside system and the village of the state agent have formed a competitive relationship, temporarily formed a relatively balanced cooperative governance model. The public sphere of the digital community makes villages from the nominal villager <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> mode of “self-management, self-education and self-service” through the public participation of the villagers.</p>

<p>The rapid development of information technology and its futuristic lead us into a new era that changed the face of human civilization. New media has become a base structure in accelerating the development of the global community in the last two decades. Digital and virtual sides attached to the new media has brought human interaction and community level to the most complex. Social interaction is in the form of the peak of its evolution where the boundaries between the real and the virtual becomes blurred, and as if no longer relevant when distinguishing the two realms. Human habitus which was originally driven by empirical external world is now automatically changed since information technology products such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s are no longer exist merely as a communication tool but also as a means of kontrolling and diggers knowledge.

<p>Objective In order to understand the role of clergy in shaping Americans’ moral worldviews, we examine whether the structure of clergy values varies in systematic ways according to contextual factors, such as disagreement in the congregation.</p>
<p>Method In early 2014 (February), clergy from a variety of Protestant denominations were contacted by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> and invited to complete a survey online, which included a 20-item moral foundations (MFs) battery as well as a variety of attitudinal, behavioral, and relational measures.</p>
<p>Results Clergy MFs resemble average citizens’, they look to preserve their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> by emphasizing individualizing foundations when they are in disagreement with their congregation, and emphasize MFs that align with their religious beliefs, especially their views on religious authority.</p>
<p>Conclusion We reject a special religious emphasis on binding foundations. While clergy take moral positions that reflect their theological commitments, we find evidence of contextualizing in how they weight moral positions.</p>

<p>The use of blended learning in higher education has increased rapidly. The Community of Inquiry (CoI) has been developed as a framework for blended learning from a socio-constructivist perspective in which learning is based on educational experiences in the environment with collaboration and interaction. The purpose of this paper is to understand student experience and explore new issues in a blended learning course from the perspective of CoI. Stake’s inductive case study approach was used and data were collected by qualitative methods. The results showed that social, cognitive and teaching presences were found in the blended learning course. However, on some occasions, students experienced learning without a teaching presence but with intrinsic drive from individuals. The students directed their own learning and shared the ideas in the discourse without teaching instruction or facilitation. Learning <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> was linked to the learning community through convenient <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communication</span> tools. This paper proposes to extend the CoI with the dimension of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> presence. An Extended Community of Inquiry (ECoI) framework is described and the categories and indicators of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> presence are expounded. The value of the paper as a contribution to literature is to enhance CoI by including the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> element.</p>

<p>The book The Mediated Construction of Reality by Nick Couldry and Andreas Hepp, published by Polity Press, presents an attempt at reconsidering the classics of social theory, namely Berger and Luckmann’s phenomenology. Half a century after the appearance of The Social Construction of Reality, two renowned media researchers ask new questions about the ways of making and understanding the social world. Today‘s world has become profoundly mediatized, and the social gets increasingly rooted in the technological infrastructure of digital communication. The pervasive mediatization of social life transforms all of its segments on both the micro- and macro-levels. The algorithms of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and other computer systems quantify and automate social processes which used to be perceived as qualitative. In order to understand this world, social theory has to revise its approaches and basic notions. According to Couldry and Hepp, the classical optics of Berger and Luckmann’s social constructionism is no longer suitable, developing a materialist phenomenology which emphasizes the role of media technologies in constructing the social world. Furthermore, these authors regard the social world as a complex network of figurations, using and adapting the ideas of Norbert Elias. Their work has a pronounced critical purpose: the authors are concerned about the relative <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of social life, which is coming under control of technological systems’ imperatives and dictated by their developers’ commercial interests. The time is approaching when the social is no longer constructed in everyday human interactions, but produced by means of various media platforms instead. Nowadays, these platforms provide us with access to the social world and constitute its space. Does this mean the end of the social construction of reality, as well as the end of social constructionism?</p>

<p>The present study examines the struggle for hegemony in the public sphere by two different systems, following Hong Kong’s handover to China in 1997. It has been postulated that the new media, particularly <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, has become an important public sphere for the citizens of Hong Kong to engage in an anti-hegemonic struggle against China’s discursive encroachment into Hong Kong since 1997. Given that the public platform provided by legacy media has been bought out or coopted by China, new media has begun to serve as a subaltern public sphere to enable resisting the hegemony imposed by China. This was analyzed through a survey conducted as part of this study, which showed that people who are young, read the Apple Daily, have high expectations of local <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and a high regard for press freedom are prone to using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> to obtain their social and political information. This article analyzes the implications of the emergence of a counter-China hegemonic public sphere.</p>

<p>Different studies on democracy and political disaffection are of the belief that the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and social networks provide new opportunities for social mobilization and citizen participation. e social mobilizations of the second decade of the 21st century, such as the Arab Spring or the 15M in Spain, defined the protagonist role of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communication</span> and social networks for the summon and the development of protests. is paper, which uses the stages of moral development and applies them to social reality, provides a theoretical proposal for a three-dimensional analysis (introducing the concepts of strategy, action, and objective) to study contemporary social mobilizations. It also presents and compares the three analytical dimensions and uses them to characterize, in an exploratory manner, three cases of social mobilization (the Arab Spring in Egypt, the 15M, and the Platform for People Affected by Mortgages in Spain). In the text, the use of social net- works and the media is a transverse study based on the three dimensions proposed. e analysis shows that some forms of protest have declined to the feelings of political frustration of citizens, and they have been displaced to a second institutional level or suffered a systematic disarticulation. We propose the conceptualization of the contemporary social movement as a collective space built on a strategy aimed at a specific political system that performs change actions focused on <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> processes and sets out long-term objectives that have been agreed upon.</p>

<p>For a decade and a half, the ways of filing and authorial intervention in web formats have invaded different spheres of action of the subjects, and have fostered behaviors of identity and cultural construction. Ways of registration and documentary organization that until recently seemed restricted to the study of institutional files, writers’ files or other ways of preservation of cultural heritage, today model the daily practices of subjects that are involved with relational processes mediated by technologies. Within the framework of this problem, our objective is to reflect on the ways of making files in the context of virtual social networks, which we consider central to understanding the dynamics of intervention of subjects and groups in the interactive digital environment. This reflection is based on a documentary analysis of the publications and user interventions in the most used social network in Argentina, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>, taking as empirical reference the last presidential campaign of 2015. The analysis is structured by considering each publication or post as a unit of content, following the principle of digital modularity. We took the 2015 presidential campaign in Argentina because, in its development, the interactive component was a key based on a premise of fundamental action arising from the analysis, which we call the imperative of the saying. This notion, within the framework of a specific publication and filing grammar, is central in order to understand strategies for capturing votes conceived from the supposed <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of users.</p>

<p>This article examines how musicians involved in the government sponsored music scene in Recife, the capital of the Brazilian state of Pernambuco, (meta)musically perform different versions of the ‘entrepreneurial self,’ a form of neoliberal subjectivity. Through comparing specific musicians’ practices and narratives, I argue Pernambucan state sponsorship is a mechanism which redefines citizenship on entrepreneurial terms and reinforces structural inequality. As government programs provide new opportunities to formalize and professionalize their labor, musicians face more bureaucratic and socioeconomic challenges that require them to broaden their musical labor to include skills like <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> marketing and grant proposal writing. These expectations are difficult enough for middle-class, educated musicians to meet, but even harder for marginalized, lower-class, and racialized citizens to manage. By comparing how three musicians construct themselves as business-oriented, transnational, or patrimonial entrepreneurs, the article makes explicit what similar studies suggest, but often leave implicit: professionalism and entrepreneurialism are increasingly interdependent. Furthermore, while the entrepreneurial self is predicated on <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, these musicians’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> paradoxically depends on a combination of social networks and state sponsorship. In sum, the article reveals how individuals are creating new subjectivities to adapt to changing economic conditions.</p>

<p>The paper develops a needs–affordances–features (NAF) perspective on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use which posits that individuals’ psychological needs motivate their use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> applications to the extent to which these applications provide affordances that satisfy these needs. Our theoretical development builds upon two psychological theories, namely self-determination and psychological ownership, to identify five psychological needs (needs for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, relatedness, competence, having a place, and self-identity), that we posit are particularly pertinent to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use. According to NAF, these psychological needs will motivate use of those <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> applications that provide salient affordances to fulfill these needs. We identify such affordances through a comprehensive review of the literature and of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> applications and put forth propositions that map the affordances to the psychological needs that they fulfill. Our theory development generates important implications. First, it has implications for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> research in that it provides an overarching comprehensive framework for the affordances of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> as a whole and the related psychological needs that motivate their use. Future studies can leverage NAF to identify psychological needs motivating the use of specific <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> sites based on the affordances the sites provide, and design science research can leverage NAF in the design and bundling of specific <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> features to engage users. Second, it has implications for technology acceptance research in that NAF can enrich existing models by opening up the mechanisms through which psychological needs influence user perceptions of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and their use patterns and behaviors. Finally, NAF provides a new lens and common vocabulary for future studies, which we hope can stimulate cumulative research endeavors to develop a comprehensive framework of information systems affordances in general and the psychological needs that information systems satisfy.</p>

Combining research in central and regional archives, interviews conducted during fieldwork, and published sources (including from <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online social network</span>s), this article reviews the institutional foundations and recruitment and working methods for this little-known form of environmental activism, which began in the Soviet period.

<p>Contemporary publics actively engage with diverse forms of media when seeking health-related information. The hugely popular digital media platform YouTube has become one means by which people share their experiences of healthcare. In this paper, we examine amateur YouTube videos featuring people receiving Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. DBS has become a widely implemented treatment, and it is surrounded by high expectations that can create difficulty for clinicians, patients and their families. We examine how DBS, Parkinson’s disease, and DBS recipients themselves, are delineated within these YouTube videos. The videos, we demonstrate, contain common compositional and stylistic elements that collectively represent DBS as a technological fix, and which accentuate the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the DBS recipient. The relational, interpersonal dimensions of chronic illness, and the complex impact of DBS on family dynamics, are elided. We therefore shed light on the means by which high expectations regarding DBS are sustained and circulated, and more generally, we illustrate how potentially powerful representations of medical technologies can emerge from the intersection of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms, afflicted bodies and patient narratives.</p>

<p>The prominence of information and communications technology (ICTs) in defining India’s media modernity can be gauged by the growing reach of online <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> as well as continuing expansion of digital media channels and satellite broadcasting even in the early 21stCentury. Policies concerning information technologies, from telegraph to satellite networks, have also been central to media politics and with the rise of new media, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> related policies have similarly become pivotal to the interaction between the state and media system. Drawing from a comparative media system perspective, this paper argues that while there has been no major constitutional or legal overhaul, as yet, new ideas and information technology policy activism are reshaping the contours of state action and ‘<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>’ of the press in India’s democracy. Comparing technology debates in an earlier era, when satellite networks swept across the media system, with the more recent deliberations around liabilities for digital intermediaries, the paper unpacks the nature of change and locates its origins in the revival of discursive institutions (Schmidt 2002, 2008) of technology policy since the early 2000s. Technology related ideas, I argue, now serve as institutions, able to function as a ‘coordinating discourse’ (ibid) that have revived ideals of an autonomous media. Technology inflected ideals of ‘anonymity’ also counter the ‘communicative discourse’ (ibid) of Hindutva and cultural nationalist politics of media which framed the issue of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the ascendant phase of print and electronic media capitalism until the 1990s.</p>

<p>The Spanish Constitution of 1978 has not only created a parliamentary government under a constitutional monarchy, but also enabled a decentralized structure which opened the way for developing co-existence mechanisms for different nationalities and ethnic groups, inhabiting 17 autonomous communities and 2 autonomous cities, varying in their degree of identification with the vision of one common Spanish state. It seems that it has not been expected, that at least one of these regions will demonstrate such strong sense of identity that it will not only demand broader <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, but also full independence. Can <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and Google tools help in achieving this goal? Will it be possible to use them to build support for Catalan activities among the international community? And finally&nbsp;– will data obtained thanks to Google enable to forecast future political events? The Author is looking for answers to these questions by analyzing data obtained during research conducted in the network, as well as information gathered while conducting interviews with Catalan politicians in the moment of region’s fight for independence.</p>

<p>The transhumanism is an international movement that states that adding technological implants and inserting DNA will improve the human being. However, the transhumanists hide two subjects: the use of technological implants as a weapon against the citizen and the method they are developing their dangerous projects with, which is suspected to be illicit human experiments in the world. Technological implants like brain nanobots might cause losing mind control and thus, the carriers can be controlled by others and lose their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, they can be spied permanently with the cerebral <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and can lose their privacy their memory can be deleted and can loose their identity. Thus, the humans who carry technological implants can be permanently spied on, mentally controlled and they lose their identity, becoming a human slave at the service of the transnational companies and the economic powers. An objective analysis reveals that transhumanism is only an intellectual swindle that leads to digital fascism, a society where a millionaire elite will govern citizens with technological implants, who will be digital slaves at the service of an oligarchy.</p>

<p>Critical assessments of the recent resurgence of right-wing nationalism have rightly highlighted the role of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> in these troubling times, yet they are constrained by an overemphasis on celebrity leaders defined as populists. This article departs from a leader-centric analysis and the liberal frame that still largely informs assessment of political action, to foreground “fun” as a salient aspect of right-wing mobilization. Building on ethnographic fieldwork among the Hindu nationalists in India, I argue that fun is a metapractice that shapes the interlinked practices of fact-checking, abuse, assembly, and aggression among online volunteers for the right-wing movement. Furthermore, fun remains crucial for an experience of absolute <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> among online users in ideological battles. Providing the daily drip feed for exclusion, fun as a metapractice bears a formal similarity to objectivity in its performative effects of distance and deniability.</p>

<p>This article presents issues related to the evolution of media and media competences, a review and analysis of selected historical, technological and educational conditions in the context of the development of digital technologies. A comparison is also made between digital, information and media competences, current development trends and future trends. The differences and requirements between qualified media users and qualified users of information technology are becoming less and less distinct. The 3 generations of Media education - 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 were described. The main purpose of media education in the first phase of development, referred to as media education 1.0, was to develop not only critical thinking skills towards the media and media messages, but also - in a general sense - critical attitude and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Media 2.0 education can be discussed in connection with the dynamic development of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies, including <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, at the beginning of the 21st century.

This stage of evolution of Media education could be identified as Media education 3.0.

<p>I bear witness as a survivor of genocide orchestrated by imperialism and carried out by neocolonial stooges who proclaimed that ‘all is fair in warfare’ and that ‘starvation is a legitimate weapon of war’ even when Igbo women and innocent men made up the bulk of the 3.1 million people killed in Biafra in 30 months. I acknowledge the knowledge of the Indigenous peoples of this land and of every land that were colonized, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>telized, racialized, victimized, pulverized, dehumanized, genocidized, proletarianized, lumpenized, marginalized, and homogenized with the tools of criminology, among other tools, for the benefits of white-supremacist imperialist patriarchy. I testify that we are survivors who were never expected to survive to meet one another and raise our voices to say, Happy Survival! To say that we are survivors is not to suggest that we have completely restored our independence but to state that for as long as the forces of imperialism are entrenched, we are determined to resist. We will keep speaking truth to unjust power the way that our ancestors defiantly stuck out their tongues and flipped their middle fingers to force the conquerors to sign treaties recognizing our <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> as human beings equal in beauty, wisdom, culture, courage and originality. This article outlines the decolonization paradigm in criminology, the rationale for this paradigmatic shift, the major contributions to this paradigm, and a projection of the future agenda of the paradigm.</p>

<p>Among the structural elements that enable <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms to durably influence our moods and behaviour, their answering a widespread desire to be liked and accepted - a desire which is seldom transparent to us - greatly increases their manipulative power. So does their ability to harvest fine-grained information about their users (and acquaintances). This data puts such platforms in a position where they can not only covertly influence our thoughts, moods and behaviour: they can do so in a way that is maximally effective given our respective traits, vulnerabilities etc. This paper argues that if we are to stand any chance of taming these platforms’ considerable manipulative potential, some conceptual spring-cleaning is needed.</p>
<p>First, we need to stop confusing regulatory power and regulation. Whereas in mechanics or <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netics there is no need to distinguish between the two -since there are no agents whose <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is infringed by regulation- when the concept of regulation is applied to human behaviour this distinction becomes crucial, and hinges upon the concept of authority. Since <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms do not - yet - claim authority, they do not regulate us: they have regulatory power over us. Our task is to regulate that power.</p>
<p>To succeed in the latter task, we also need to acknowledge that the type of influence exercised by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms is not merely non-deliberative: it is also covert. While the former is often unproblematic from an ethical/legal perspective, the latter not only threatens our right to freedom of thought, it also compromises our commitment to moral equality.</p>

This field undergoes constant and profound changes, especially visible in documentation processes. A situation characterized by the existence of tablets, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s, applications, and by the almost achieved digitization of traditional documents, in addition to the crisis of the press business model, that involves mutations in the journalists’ tasks and in the relationship between them and Documentation.

<p>This article highlights the dynamics of values in our reasoning on public space. By means of an epistemological study, illustrated by examples in the Dutch city of Amsterdam, it tests the contemporary premises underlying our ways to safeguard the inclusive, democratic, agential city, and, as such, it aims to update our view on public space. The article raises three subsequent questions: [i] Is the city our common house as perceived from the Renaissance onward, containing all, and consequently are public spaces used by the people as a whole? [ii] Is the city formalising our municipal <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> as emphasised since the Enlightenment, in an anti-egoistic manner, and in this line, are public spaces owned by local governments representing the people? And, [iii] is the city open to our general view as advocated in Modern reasoning, restricting entrepreneurial influences, and synchronically, are its public spaces seen and/or known by everyone? Inclusiveness, democracy, and ‘agentiality’ are strongholds in our scientific thinking on public space and each issue echoes through in an aim to keep cities connected and accessible, fair and vital, and open and social. Yet, conflicts appear between generally-accepted definitions and what we see in the city. Primarily based upon confronting philosophy with the Amsterdam case for this matter, the answering of questions generates remarks on this aim. Contemporary Western illuminations on pro-active citizens, participatory societies, and effects of, among others, global travel, migration, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and micro-blogging forecast a more differentiated image of public space and surmise to enforce diversification in our value framework in urban theory and praxis.</p>

<p>Over ten years ago, two community media initiatives were founded by young people in their early twenties in Bogota, Colombia and Quito, Ecuador. While the Colombia-based collective, Ojo al Sancocho, has struggled to build bridges among urban and migratory communities uprooted by an entrenched, decades-old armed conflict, the Ecuadorian group, El Churo Comunicacin, has fostered audiovisual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and resistance among indigenous, feminist and ecological social movements that have had to defend their rights even though they were supposedly guaranteed by a so-called progressive government. Despite formidable challenges, each has fulfilled a long-held dream - a community movie theater, and the expansion of a radio-based practice to a multiplicity of practices that include community filmmaking, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>feminism and capacity-building of communities across Ecuador and Latin America. Together with other collectives, Ojo al Sancocho and El Churo are building a network of community filmmakers across Latin America. Using each organizations 2017 annual gathering as a point of departure, and subsequent meetings in 2018-2019, this article analyzes the characteristics that have led to innovation and sustainability in diverse contexts. It also indicates key challenges they face. This is an engaged, ethnographically-based, scholarly work.</p>

<p>This article aims at analyzing the discourse involved in the city council program called “Recife, city of the people”, from Foucault’s archeology of knowledge perspective. The corpus of this research consists of six videos available on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>® page of the city council of Recife in 2014, when government agency released the slogan “Recife, Cidade das Pessoas”. The study is justified by the need of understanding how the political discourses are spread and how these discourses have no explicit assumptions. We believe that a better design of the influence of discourses, along with further clarification of social significance exercised by them, can contribute to a more democratic social life, which will be accessible to the entire population. For the present study, no theory was previously defined. The option for this construction enables the non-interference of external factors guiding the analyses. Data was analyzed without theoretical influences, so that the theoretical constructs emerged from the analysis rather than the reverse. However, the vision of authorship in relation to the concept of speech interferes with the analysis and serves as a theoretical lens through which data will be displayed. For results, two discursive formations were found: (1) the protection of the Government and (2) healthy lifestyles practices, with includes social, cultural and physical. This discursive formation is founded on the pillars of bio-politics and sustainability, quality of life and social change. It was noticed that the program has a goal it is to influence people’s opinions about public spaces and mobility in a municipality.</p>

<p>BookTubers (from the acronym book + YouTuber) have become key players for the publishing industry, given their influence on children and teens to promote reading and book consumption. Based on an 18-month digital ethnography that combines direct observation, digital interactions on YouTube channels, and other <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and semistructured interviews with 17 Spanish-speaking BookTubers, this study uses Pierre Bourdieu’s concepts of field and capital to analyze how BookTubers negotiate their practices with other agents of the publishing world. This article characterizes the challenges the Spanish-language publishing industry is facing in the context of digitalization to attract readers; describes the position that BookTubers have within the YouTube ecosystem, and how they relate with the platform’s actors, politics, and affordances; and analyzes the exchanges that BookTubers establish with publishers—often referred as collaborations—and their implications for their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. This case study helps to understand how platformization allows new agents to transfer capital gained in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> to other cultural industries.</p>

<p>This article tries to diagnose possibilities and limitations of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online media</span> as a digital agora — a virtual space for citizens’ deliberation which could potentially strengthen and enhance democracy in Poland, as well as in other Central European countries. Considering the key features of the public sphere indicated by Habermas inclusiveness, rationality, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, lack of hierarchy, the analysis focuses on three problem areas. Th e fi rst one includes the impact of digital exclusion upon availability of the digital public sphere for citizens. The second part of the study is devoted to rationality and interactivity of online discourse. The last part of the analysis addresses the impact of the relative anonymity of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communication</span> on the equality and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of citizens’ deliberation on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>.</p>

<p>The article addresses the concept of conviviality created by Ivan Illich in the 1970s. That concept is still very interesting for rethinking production, consumption and education parameters in our society, as it defends that communities must be more autonomous from institutions. Authors such as Manzini and Thackara have recently brought these ideas back. Conviviality has been associated to sustainability, since it reduces the demand for material goods. It is possible to develop decentralised systems for learning and teaching, with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. And it is possible to create objects in a more autonomous way, sothat people can have an active part. This paper investigates conviviality in education and design and presents the examples of convivial learning and creationthat happened at a University Design course, and at bamboo design workshops and a clothes refashioning event.</p>

<p>Online interactions are often understood through the corporate <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> (CSM) model where social interactions are determined through layers of abstraction and centralization that eliminate users from decision-making processes. This study demonstrates how alternative <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> (ASM)—namely Mastodon—restructure the relationship between the technical structure of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and the social interactions that follow, offering a particular type of sociality distinct from CSM. Drawing from a variety of qualitative data, this analysis finds that (1) the decentralized structure of Mastodon enables community <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, (2) Mastodon’s open-source protocol allows the internal and technical development of the site to become a social enterprise in and of itself, and (3) Mastodon’s horizontal structure shifts the site’s scaling focus from sheer number of users to quality engagement and niche communities. To this end, Mastodon helps us rethink “the social” in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> in terms of topology, abstraction, and scale.</p>

<p>The article deals with the revealing of the negative side of the key processes (such as informatization and globalization) in contemporary society, leading to its problematization. The article is based on the structural and functional, socio-cultural, cultural and historical, and comparative approaches. It is argued that the processes of economization and informatization of relations overlap each other, causing a cumulative effect and reinforcing the negative side of the globalization. This exacerbates the anthropological crisis and causes a number of structural transformations in different spheres of social life: economy, science, education, politics, public administration, etc., by changing their social status towards asociality. Under these conditions, information and knowledge are used as tools to promote the ideology of neoliberalism, which is accompanied by the destruction of the principle of individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and thus, leads to the deliberalization of society. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and communication technolog</span>ies themselves are becoming the means for the emergence of the new netocratic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>-elite.</p>

<p>Desktop film or computer screen film is a film subgenre with all events and actions taking place on a screen of a computer and using the protagonist’s first-person perspective, exemplified by The Den (2013), Open Windows(2014), Unfriended (2014), Unfriended: Dark Web (2018), Profile (2018) and Searching(2018). This paper mainly focuses on the desktop films with the theoretical framework of “Media Ecology”, aiming to investigate how the desktop film evolves and interacts with new media, digital technology, while influencing communication and spectatorship. Firstly, this paper discusses the evolution of cinema, which evolves through the interaction, co-existence and convergence with other media, as well as corresponds to the anthropotropic trend. Secondly, this paper investigates the digital media and technology in desktop films. “Desktop films” create <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>spaces and reproduce people’s virtual lives, revealing the influences of media technology, which is considered as a double-edged sword. Thirdly, this paper analyzes how desktop film exerts impacts on cinematic communication, while reshaping the spectatorship and audience’s viewing mechanism. “Desktop films” are suitable to be watched on computer, thus making audiences become active and have more <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.</p>

<p>This article investigates the influence of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communication</span>s platforms on Iranian journalists’ struggle for countering the restrictions, and achieving their journalistic ends. Based on 26 interviews with journalists working in the established media in Iran, it shows that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking website</span>s and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile mess</span>aging applications are arenas of mobilization and leverage for journalists in this semi-authoritarian context. Online platforms function as sources of social and symbolic assets for journalists enabling them to make others see and think about an issue, and act on it, thus employ journalistic symbolic power. This article applies Bourdieu’s concepts of doxa, social capital, symbolic capital and symbolic power to explain, why and under what circumstances certain journalistic online strategies become operative. The findings offer insights into how new media affect power relations between journalists and the forces that restrict their practices and offer potentials for relatively more journalistic <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in a controlled media environment.</p>

<p>Public opinion is shaped in significant part by online content, spread via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and curated algorithmically. The current online ecosystem has been designed predominantly to capture user attention rather than to promote deliberate cognition and autonomous choice; information overload, finely tuned personalization and distorted social cues, in turn, pave the way for manipulation and the spread of false information. How can transparency and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> be promoted instead, thus fostering the positive potential of the web? Effective web governance informed by behavioural research is critically needed to empower individuals online. We identify technologically available yet largely untapped cues that can be harnessed to indicate the epistemic quality of online content, the factors underlying algorithmic decisions and the degree of consensus in online debates. We then map out two classes of behavioural interventions-nudging and boosting- that enlist these cues to redesign online environments for informed and autonomous choice.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social media</span> platforms have increasingly become an important way for news organizations to distribute content to their audiences. As news organizations relinquish control over distribution, they may feel the need to optimize their content to align with platform logics to ensure economic sustainability. However, the opaque and often proprietary nature of platform algorithms makes it hard for news organizations to truly know what kinds of content are preferred and will perform well. Invoking the concept of algorithmic ‘folk theories,’ this article presents a study of in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 18 U.S.-based news journalists and editors to understand how they make sense of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> algorithms, and to what extent this influences editorial decision making. Our findings suggest that while journalists’ understandings of platform algorithms create new considerations for gatekeeping practices, the extent to which it influences those practices is often negotiated against traditional journalistic conceptions of newsworthiness and journalistic <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.</p>

<p>Purpose : This descriptive study investigates the genesis and change in physical educators’ <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use for professional development and learning. Method : Data were collected through semistructured interviews with 48 physical educators who had actively used various <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> professionally for an extended period of time. The data were analyzed inductively and aligned to the basic psychological needs defined by self-determination theory: relatedness, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and competence. Results : Building relationships with a trusted network of people and opportunities to express their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> were important drivers in the participants’ genesis and continued use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. Developing competence at both the start and throughout their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> journey was also critical. Discussion/Conclusions : The findings provide a starting point for in-depth research on the motivational characteristics underpinning physical educators’ reasons for starting and continuing to use <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> for professional development and learning, and how these might change over time based on different psychological needs.</p>

<p>This article examines the emerging phenomenon of the non-use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">WeChat</span> Moments. Drawing upon semi-structured interviews with 21 users who used Moments for at least 6 months, then voluntarily discontinued their use of the feature, we discuss the complex dynamics of Moments use, exploring the implicit micro-behavioral process of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> practice. Countering the purported hyper-centrality of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">WeChat</span>, we identified a periodic loop of “use, non-use, reuse” of Moments, suggesting that people suspend their use of Moments periodically to “re-domesticate” technology. Through the prism of the domestication approach, we argue that the re-domestication of Moments is a “reboot” of the whole process of domestication through four key stages: re-appropriation, re-objectification, re-incorporation, and re-conversion. Re-domestication is a process that allows people to take a retrospective look at their lives and transform Moments from a disruptive app feature into an instrumental apparatus conducive to their personal and professional well-being. By examining this process, we discuss how people use innovative ways to regain their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and agency in their daily interactions with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">WeChat</span>.</p>

<p>Enterprise <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> (ESM) have become imperative technologies in contemporary organizations, in part, due to promised improvements of efficiency and coordination. Given that past studies have primarily focused on the potential merits of these emerging technologies, less is known about the hidden power dynamics involved in the enactment of ESM. In this paper, we present the findings of an ethnographic study at a startup accelerator in which we examined how and why the enactment of ESM shapes and (re)produces power dynamics. Based on our analysis, we develop a process model that theorizes the emergence of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>–control tensions in the enactment of ESM through continual drifts of decision-making between the online and offline worlds. As we show, these drifts are produced through non liquets and the emergence of urgency. Furthermore, we demonstrate the consequentiality of these dynamics, which turn ESM into an irreducible part of organizational processes. Our findings contribute to the burgeoning literature at the intersection of emerging technologies and organizing by surfacing power-related, potentially detrimental side effects inherent to organizing through such technologies.</p>

<p>The development of the information society causes a new direction of socialization – media socialization, especially it’s relevant for young people, who is an active media consumer.The essence of the notions of «media space», «media socialization», «<span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> socialization» are analyzed in the article. The features of the media space functioning are considered, taking into account the factors of socialization, its functions are represented in accordance with the traditional socialization process. The influence of the media on the socialization process is determined as a condition for the further development of the components in the youth media socialization. The principles of youth media socialization in the conditions of media space are offered (system, activity, bilateral interaction of personality and virtual reality, media activity and critical thinking). The components of the media-socialization process are presented (forms, mechanisms, agents of media-socialization, etc.). The indicators of successful and unsuccessful media socialization are indicated. The basic conflict of media socialization is determined, which affects its result (the balance of virtual and real).The media socialization criteria with corresponding levels of development and indicators is offered in the article (media adaptability, media <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, media activity). The levels of media-socialization of youth are presented in conditions of modern media space.The study of the process of youth media socialization was confirmed by the high percentage of respondents with low (38.5%) and medium (41.8%) levels of media-socialization. At the same time, the high level of media-socialization was characteristic only for 19.7% of respondents.The issue of media socialization of young people becomes acute in connection with the situation that has developed in the state. The system of social education institutions faces the challenge of initiating changes in young people entering into the media space, which in the future will create effective conditions for development taking into account media resources. The problem of youth media socialization is not limited to the research conducted. Promising areas of scientific research can be: development of socio-pedagogical conditions and technology of media-socialization of the individual; development of methodical support for the implementation of media-socialization technology in general educational institutions; introduction of foreign experience of youth media socialization into practice of social work.</p>

<p>In a networked society, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> has become central to individuals’ lives. It has enabled people to access information, interact with communities, share experiences, find entertainment, and learn. This paper explores an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>y on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Instagram</span> where members connect by sharing narratives, stories, memories, and other accounts of foreign language learning. The research seeks to assess the ways an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>y on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Instagram</span> can be a learning network. It also investigates the affordances perceived by the community members in their language learning histories (LLHs). The analysis revealed that the community matches the network principles proposed by Downes (2012): <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> , diversity, openness, and interactivity. Also, LLHs reveal that, in their personal learning networks, narrators have perceived affordances to interact with foreign language speakers; explore multimodality; make connections between native and foreign language; interact with technologies and cultural artifacts; practise repetition; find personal connections with the foreign language; participate in fandoms; and pay attention to foreign language speakers. The stories shared in the learning network indicate that the actions upon affordances perceived in informal environments seem to have a positive impact on learners’ linguistic repertoires, identities, and emotions.</p>

<p>Abstract The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> has led to a rearrangement of the public and private spheres. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social media</span> in particular have contributed to the blurring of boundaries between public and private as they allow for unrestricted self-representation via text, images, and video to a more or less unlimited online audience. More than ever, individuals are thus forced to take into account questions of un/desired observability. For a critical analysis of this development, this article draws upon Jürgen Habermas’ The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere and Beate Rössler’s The Value of Privacy . Both authors argue that the modulation of publicness and privacy is intertwined with the process of individuation and hence concerns the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the individual, as self-realization depends upon responses from others, but also upon the ability to withdraw from public scrutiny. Drawing upon their findings, the article discusses if and how <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> enhance or delimit self-realization and therefore serve or hinder individuation and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.</p>

<p>Purpose This paper aims to investigate the extent of intellectual capital disclosure (ICD) through websites and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> in Spanish local government (SLG) and analyze the factors that explain their disclosure. Design/methodology/approach The study applies content analysis and regression techniques. The ICD is analyzed for Spanish municipalities with more than 100,000 inhabitants and provincial capitals over a period from January 2018 to February 2020. Findings Findings emphasize that the quantity of disclosed information on intellectual capital (IC) is in the low level, particularly with regard to human capital (HC). Furthermore, the results show that the information provided via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> mainly concerns the relational capital (RC). On the other hand, results obtained indicate that larger municipalities, with lower financial <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and whose citizens have a high income level use the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online media</span> (both websites and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>) more actively to disclose information about IC. Finally, municipalities led by women and with high level of citizens’ education exert a positive influence in the ICD only on websites. Practical implications This paper makes a number of key contributions to the existing body of knowledge, focusing on ICD, a neglected area in the public sector accounting literature. It explores and identifies the supply-side and demand-side determinants of information affecting the ICD in local governments. The results of this research could be useful for policymakers, regulators and governments’ managers to improve the online information addressing ICD issues. Originality/value This paper adopts an innovative perspective by investigating the use of alternative tools for ICD in local government context (websites and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>). To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study that focuses on investigating the determinants of online ICD in local governments.</p>

<p>Public communication in digital space is entering a phase of profound change due to the redefinition of the forms of production, dissemination and use of content in institutional networks. This article contributes to research carried out on public communication news flows of SNSs, presenting an analysis focusing on the visual content posted on institutional information channels dedicated to young people and managed by youth policy actors. The content of photos was analyzed in relation to 6 categories of public communication topics, 3 categories of communication aims, 6 categories of visual elements and 10 thematic areas. The empirical basis consists of 702 images taken from 15 accounts of Italian and European youth policy <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Instagram</span> channels. The results show the main features of institutional flows on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Instagram</span> and a comparison with what has emerged from previous research projects relating to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span>. The findings focus on institutional topics and promotional aims and on the weaknesses of the flow of images in terms of social and political issues, engagement, public-service information, semantic <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and emotional impact. The limits that emerge from the research identify certain critical questions which indicate a need for further investigation with respect to relationships occurring between public news flows, young people, information requirements and social networks in the public sphere.</p>

<p>This interdisciplinary cross-cultural research explores antecedents for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> networking satisfaction for Spanish and American consumers. Conceptually rooted in a sense of community, self-determination theory, and Hofstede’s cultural dimensions, our descriptive study samples consist of n = 367 Americans and n = 161 Spaniards. Analysis with fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) interrogates two propositions to identify recipes. Proposition 1 indicates that <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is not a necessary ingredient for either culture; self-presentation in the virtual world need not mirror the true self to provide short-term virtual satisfaction. Proposition 2 suggests that both cultures value relatedness and competence as motivations for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> behavior. While Americans value interactivity more than their counterparts, Spaniards value competence more, to experience <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> networking satisfaction. Digital marketing managers must better understand cross-cultural differences and consider virtual value propositions offered to members of various cultures to better navigate the dynamic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> environment.</p>

<p>To understand why <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms’ potency as a tool for manipulation is inadequately apprehended through content-neutral, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-focused analyses, this paper starts with an overview of the structural conditions that allowed such platforms to acquire their considerable regulatory power. Among these conditions, two elements stand out: the hidden -rather than non-deliberative- influence as well as its precise and comprehensive scope. While the hidden influence is what sets <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> apart from other, non-manipulatory tools of influence, it is the comprehensive scope that exposes the limits of ‘value-neutral’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-based frameworks. When we are manipulated into acquiring a certain trait, there is normally enough left of us that is free of manipulatory influence to anchor some after-the-fact endorsement or alienation test. As an alternative to ‘value-neutral’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-based analyses, this paper analyses the harm that stems from such systematic manipulation through a capability account of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Of all the capabilities that are essential to what von Humboldt would call ‘self-realisation’, the capacity to imagine oneself as a different person is critical. It is also the capability that is most endangered by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>’s drive to optimise our online (and offline) environment to maximise user engagement.</p>

<p>This article seeks to reflect on the implications of literacy as a fundamental educational competence for citizens of the globalized world. In order to achieve this purpose, we characterize some of the paths on which this knowledge is disseminated and explain how it relates to written culture, educational processes and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies (ICT). In addition, it opens a space for reflection on the matter in Venezuela in recent years; supported by Bravo (2011) and Uzcátegui and Bravo (2017) reviews of official data. It is emphasized that literacy is decisively linked to the construction of the personal <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> necessary for lifelong learning and the consideration of reading and writing as social and cultural practices. In conclusion, it is considered that all entities and social actors should assume the commitment to literacy and the promotion of written culture, in its different formats and modalities. In this case, democratic governments’ responsibility of implementing cultural, educational, social and economic policies is underlined, for their implementation increases responsibility towards the people, and also, towards their living conditions.</p>

<p>Working life has digitalized considerably in recent decades and organizations have taken into use new forms of collaborative technologies such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms. This study examined the relationship between <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use at work and well-being at work for millennials and members of former generations in Finland. The research data contained focus group interviews (N = 52), an expert organization survey (N = 563), and a nationally representative survey (N = 1817). Well-being measures included technostress, burnout, psychological distress, and a set of background variables. Content analysis and linear regression models were used as analysis methods. The results showed that millennials have various intrinsic and extrinsic motivations for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use at work. Intrinsic motivations included employees’ personal choice and their pure interest to follow the market and discussions in their own field. Extrinsic motivations were related mainly to organizations’ work culture and personal branding. The survey findings revealed, however, that millennials were not only more active <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> users for work, but they also experienced higher technostress and burnout than members of former generations. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social media</span> use motivations were associated with both higher and lower technostress and burnout depending on motivation, indicating that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use can have both positive and negative effects. Overall, our findings suggest that employees tend to utilize <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> more if their needs for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness are fulfilled.</p>

<p>This study statistically analyzed survey data to examine the relationship between fulfillment of psychological needs of 223 Chinese sojourners in the United States and their online self-presentation strategies on Chinese and American <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. The results showed that the combined use of proactive and defensive self-presentation strategies on Chinese <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> instead of American <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> were more effective to fulfill the sojourners’ need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Moreover, presentation strategies that helped to meet the sojourners’ need for relatedness were significantly different between Chinese and American <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. Specifically, a proactive strategy was more effective to meet sojourners’ need for relatedness on Chinese <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, while a defensive strategy was more effective to fulfill their need for relatedness on American <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>.</p>

<p>In this paper, we explore how cryptocurrencies have been received in Sweden and Japan, and what specific attitudes and discourses may reveal about the ethical implications surrounding this new technology. By way of topic modelling prevalent discourses on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> among users of cryptocurrencies, and teasing out the more culturally situated significance in such interactions through discourse analysis, our aim is to unpack the way certain tropes and traces around the notion of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> may provide a fruitful lens through which we may discern how this technology has been received in each respective country. The ultimate aim of the paper is to shed light on the attitudes that inform the way this technology is perceived and the cultural and ideological nuances that this brings to the fore, as well as how this culturally nuanced view may help us better discern the potential advantages and ethical challenges associated with this new technology.</p>

<p>It is well documented that social interactions have a crucial impact on all aspects of personal development for adolescents, however few studies have documented how social interactions affect a young person’s sense of sexual agency. The aim of the current qualitative study was to examine young people’s perceptions of their own sexual agency in relation to their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> attitudes and behaviors. Participants (n = 31) were recruited from a nonprofit organization and asked to complete a one-hour in-depth interview and a demographic survey. Using an inductive method, involving constant comparison, we identified four overarching themes: (a) Participants utilize different <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms for distinct purposes and are cognizant of each audience; (b) Based on past experiences, participants have negotiated and created their own rules of engagement for online behavior; (c) Participants have different expectations about how others should act online versus how they act in relation to flirty or sexual messages; (d) Participants were concerned about the authenticity of online identities and are aware of vulnerability in online interactions. Our results highlight the need for sexual health researchers to observe social network etiquette closely through the lens of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and agency.</p>

<p>Emerging global social movement and media activist practices are integrating intersectional politics into technologically facilitated activism. Based on a multiyear empirical study, this article proposes a preliminary theoretical framework that maps 5 key dimensions of an emergent intersectional technopolitics : (1) intersectional anticapitalist politics enacted in meta-issue movements; (2) distributed online–offline media architectures and motility; (3) multiplicities of genres, forms, technologies, and spaces; (4) translocal solidarity economies and technologies; and (5) liberatory intersectional mechanisms of collective <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The author argues that intersectional technopolitics is an innovative and complex set of coherent global social movement and media activist practices rooted in meta-issue movements integrated with transmedia digital technologies. The article concludes with a critical analysis of contradictions encountered by intersectional technopolitics activists as they interact with the structures of broader social movements, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> technologies, and societal hierarchies.</p>

<p>Independent journalism on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> networks appears to be changing the world of journalism. Building on Bourdieu’s field theory, the present study looked at journalists’ perceptions of values expressed in their online activities as compared to traditional news values. In-depth interviews were conducted with leading journalists active on traditional and online platforms in Israel in order to better understand journalists’ perceptions of the journalistic culture on the two kinds of platforms. The study found that by strongly emphasizing <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, online platforms empower journalists to embrace new values, including public service and immediacy. A public service ideology has expanded into online efforts to actively promote diverse issues that are not necessarily covered by traditional media. Immediacy is now dictated by the features of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, which force journalists to respond in real time to all events relevant to their cause. Two values in the model of journalistic culture were found to be incompatible with the features of journalists’ online operations, and the ethics and objectivity of traditional journalism have been completely replaced by the online journalists’ orientation towards promoting their personal opinions, ideologies and agendas.</p>

<p>Objective: To analyze the symbolic violence related to COVID-19 and the elderly on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. Methods: Qualitative research with a Brazilian case study as investigation strategy. The data collected for analysis were Brazilian memes published on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Instagram</span> <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. Such memes were randomly selected by searching the words “elderly” and “quarantine”. In order to analyze as much material as possible, nineteen memes were selected. Content analysis, as proposed by Bardin, was used to investigate data supported by QSR NVivo® software. Results: Two categories for analysis emerged from the connection observed on the content of the memes selected: the elderly stigmatization and their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> denial. Final Considerations: The analysis of the study allowed interpreting that aged people have been constantly experiencing symbolic violence linked to COVID-19 on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>.</p>

<p>Scholarly attention to hashtagging on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> sites has focused on their catagorization affordances. Grounded in the literature on online identity, this article examines how Tumblr users tactically use hashtagging architecture for publicity and privacy in self-expression. The analysis is based on Tumblr posts and their corresponding hashtags, combined with text-based, synchronous interviews with users. We find that participants use hashtags as a form of intimate expression, offering “secret whisper” spaces. Participants acknowledged a distinction between these spaces of intimacy and the more conventional space of the post. Extending on Goffman’s dramaturgical approach, we argue that this intimacy practice is a form of stage whispering, which is neither front- nor backstage, but implies and assumes intimacy while on the stage, as an actor might imply and assume intimacy stage whispering to her audience.</p>

<p>This article examines the legal and normative foundations of media content regulation in the borderless networked society. We explore the extent to which <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> undertakings should be subject to state regulation, in light of Canada’s ongoing debates and legislative reform. We bring a cross-disciplinary perspective (from the subject fields of law; communications studies, in particular McLuhan’s now classic probes; international relations; and technology studies) to enable both policy and language analysis. We apply the concept of sovereignty to states (national cultural and digital sovereignty), media platforms (transnational sovereignty), and citizens (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and personal data sovereignty) to examine the competing dynamics and interests that need to be considered and mediated. While there is growing awareness of the tensions between state and transnational media platform powers, the relationship between media content regulation and the collection of viewers’ personal data is relatively less explored. We analyse how future media content regulation needs to fully account for personal data extraction practices by transnational platforms and other media content undertakings. We posit national cultural sovereignty—a constant unfinished process and framework connecting the local to the global—as the enduring force and justification of media content regulation in Canada. The exercise of state sovereignty may be applied not so much to secure strict territorial borders and centralized power over citizens but to act as a mediating power to promote and protect citizens’ individual and collective interests, locally and globally.</p>

<p>Abstract Concertive control (CC) theory has primarily been applied to traditional offline, work-based, closed membership teams. New organizational forms such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>ies have opened up additional sites in which CC processes may operate. This article makes several contributions to CC theory and research. First, it increases the applicability of CC theory by extending it from offline to online, work to non-work, and closed to open membership contexts. Second, it increases our understanding of CC processes by elaborating on three mechanisms of CC (group <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, group identification, and generative discipline) and how they operate differently in online work/non-work and closed/open contexts. Third, it develops propositions about how these mechanisms interact with three prominent media affordances (visibility, persistence and editability) within those contexts. Extending CC theory to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>ies helps to explain individuals’ responses to normative group pressures online, which is highly relevant in our increasingly culturally and politically polarized society.</p>

<p>Abstract Enterprise <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> (ESM) have largely gone ignored in discussions of the datafication practices of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms. This article presents an initial step towards filling this research gap. My research question in this article regards how employees of companies using the ESM Workplace from <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> feel that the implementation of this particular platform relates to their potential struggles for digital privacy and work–life segmentation. Methodologically, I explore this through a qualitative interview study of 21 Danish knowledge workers in different organisations using the ESM. The central analytical proposal of the article is that the interviewees express a “digital resignation” towards the implementation of the ESM. In contrast to previous discussions, this resignation cannot only be thought of as “corporately cultivated” by third parties, but must also be considered as “organisationally cultivated” by the organisations people work for. The study suggests that datafication-oriented media studies should consider organisational contexts.</p>

<p>Based on qualitative and quantitative analyses, activist work and HCI approaches, these papers show how organizations formed partnerships to curate information resources, and deploy community Wi-Fi and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> infrastructure across southwest US Indigenous communities during the most challenging months of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. For Native Americans this means ideating while navigating colonial inequality. Through an investigation of sociotechnical interdependencies across a broadband network cooperative, tribes, and university labs, an HCI team reflects on how relational stability sustains fragile <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> ecologies stretched to capacity by the needs of users deeply affected by COVID-19 in New Mexico and Arizona. Through an autoethnography of community-centered digital solutions for Navajo Nation, a member of the Nation considers how the role of K’é informs a system of infrastructural care in a nation struggling with high rates of infection and systemic lack of adequate infrastructure. Through an advocacy-oriented analysis of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> content, a Diné and Lakota <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> scholar discerns the relationship between community enforcement of social distancing, the loss of interpersonal interaction, mutual aid, and the impact of public health memes for the Navajo Nation. Through radical librarianship practices, a Tohono O’odham librarian and artist counteracts the values of ‘information neutrality’ shaping whiteness-centering American librarianship by generating a community-curated solution to actionable information about COVID-19 for Indigenous communities. This panel models decolonial liberation rooted in responsiveness across mediated layers of Indigenous belonging. The authors express Indigenous interpretations of collective <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> vis-a-vis strategic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> assemblages, and particularly, how an Indigenous ethics of care intersects with the dream of an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> for social good.

<p>The article provides an overview of the Croatian media landscape and its transformation that has been driven by the processes of democratization, commercialization and digitalization.The main media-related concerns from 1990 to 2000 were freedom of the press, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of journalism and censorship. The liberalization of the media market that started in 2000, led to proliferation of media outlets and galloping commercialization of media ownership and content. The next big change came with digitalization that fundamentally altered media habits of Croatian audiences. Television was preceded by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online media</span> as the main source of news while the press registers constant decline in readership, trust and advertising revenues. Radio remains the most trusted medium, as opposed to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> that are the least trusted source of information. Nevertheless, the level of trust in social networks in Croatia is considerably higher than the EU average.The data on media freedom and journalistic <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> indicate that Croatia has made significant progress in this respect in the past thirty years. Although problems related to freedom, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and political pressure persist, the biggest threat to journalism nowadays seems to come from within the profession. Commercialization, coupled with digitalization and merciless struggle for survival, eventually led news media to succumb to tabloid-style journalism and to radically downplay their professional standards. Although the role of the media as a social corrective remains undisputed, such media practices seem to cultivate ‘media fatigue’ and foster distrust in political institutions. In such an ethically challenging environment, the newsrooms and professional organizations remain for the most part silent about eroding professional standards.</p>

<p>This paper aims to examine brand-generated communities from the community managers’ point of view and investigate how <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> influences managerial perceptions, attitudes and practises around brand communities.,The literature review examines the most prominent constructs describing consumer groupings around brands. It then focuses on how the term “brand community” has evolved throughout the years and transformed in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> environment. Research involving one survey and one focus group among agency-employed brand community managers was conducted to explore and interpret their views and their work.,Brand community managers aim to increase platform metrics. They encourage interaction between each user and the brand, but not between users. While they execute pre-planned content calendars handling comments, they do not have the experience and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to foster a communal environment. Finally, managers rely on extrinsic incentives, and even antagonise users, regarding control over the community.,The sample covers the majority of agency-employed brand community managers in one country: Greece. The findings call for a re-examination of the construct of brand community, as well as for a new assessment of groupings consumers form around brands in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>.,For actual brand communities to emerge in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, community managers should have more training, experience and initiative to tailor content and metrics, use intrinsic incentives and propose engaging activities. The quest for platform-imposed measurements inhibits this opportunity, and so do centralised processes that define global brand management.,The managerial aspect of brand-generated communities is understudied, especially when management is outsourced. This paper provides insight on how platform priorities and managerial practises dilute expectations that consumer-generated communities have created.</p>

<p>Rivendell, a free and open source software suite for automated radio broadcasting, has brought several groups with clashing stances on technology, communication, and cultural politics into cooperation. This paper treats Rivendell as an opening onto the politics at play when the liberal ethos propelling free and open source software (Coleman, 2013) meets the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-prizing traditions of independent broadcasting within an automation system. Complicating this already tense juncture, Rivendell has drawn users and code contributors from drastically opposed political groups within American broadcastings—right-wing Christian talk radio networks and progressive community stations—and has sustained a difficult terrain of working compromise that the activist push for low-power FM broadcasting inaugurated (Dunbar-Hester, 2014). In this paper, analysis of Rivendell’s open source code base sheds light on its development and helps connect it to longer histories of media automation and its attendant social frictions. Interviews with lead Rivendell developers complete the picture of the project’s trajectory, of its relation to the religious right context where the project began, and of the negotiations that have played out among its developers and its community of users in terrestrial and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> radio. The ongoing compromises and tensions threaded through Rivendell can offer insight into an issue that becomes larger and more pressing as media become increasingly complex and networked: how artists, activists, and media technologists who prioritize independence have reckoned with their reliance on socio-technical infrastructures whose connections may strike them as far less than savory.</p>

<p>This paper explores the changing socio-cultural dynamic between local music entrepreneurs and journalists/critics on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> in Estonia. Through the analysis of 32 semi-structured interviews with music industry professionals and experts and observations of their activities on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>, the study identifies the decreasing distance between music criticism and music promotion. On the one hand, the music critics once envisioned as ‘autonomous gatekeepers’ (Hirsch, 1972) find it increasingly hard to transfer their musical authority, expertise and perceived independence to the commercially driven <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> environment. As a result, some of them have taken up entrepreneurship themselves, converged their various identities by mixing their critical/evaluative practices as critics and business-oriented practices as entrepreneurs. On the other hand, some niche music entrepreneurs are stepping into the role of cultural authorities by mobilizing and catering to specific taste cultures and genre communities by becoming expert gatekeepers in their own right, despite being compromised by their business interest. In this context, it is no more useful to talk about the ‘mutual dependency’ of the music press and industry PR (Forde, 2001; Negus, 1992). Rather, among the tightly interwoven music scenes like the ones in Estonia, where many players adopt a variety of different and often conflicting roles (especially on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>), we should recognize the complete convergence of music promotion and music criticism and the loss of critical distance and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> altogether.</p>

<p>Indigenous voices and outlooks are often overlooked within public discourses in Australia and throughout the world. Settler-colonialism has resulted in centuries of dispossession, manifesting in the denial of Indigenous citizenship, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and sovereignty. Throughout this article we discuss how Indigenous people are increasingly turning to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> to illuminate how colonialism continues to oppress Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and communities. In doing so, Indigenous people are disrupting what we call the ‘colonial algorithms’ that shape misguided perceptions of Indigenous people and identities. Analysing Indigenous use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and centring our discussion around several Indigenous-led online campaigns, we demonstrate how online platforms are bringing an array of social issues to light in ways that privilege Indigenous voices and perspectives, ultimately disrupting and shifting oppressive colonial algorithms.</p>

<p>The fast and global way which has characterized the presence of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s in society has sparked the interest of several sectors of activity, including journalism. From the early stages of production to distribution, and then through the characteristics of content and consumption patterns, numerous changes have been introduced by these mobile devices in an activity that has been undergoing one of the most uncertain moments in its long history. This uncertainty has stemmed from the decrease in income which was caused by the emergence of new competitors, such as the online press and social networks. This bibliographic review aims at identifying the changes caused by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s in the production distribution and consumption of news, analyzing its effect on the epistemology of journalism. We attempt to ascertain if the increasing influence of mobile technologies in the journalistic activity has changed its nature, improving the production of knowledge. Upon closer reading of the bibliography, it can be concluded that the versatility of mobile devices has facilitated a set of new possibilities not only for journalists, namely more <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and a reduction in the time spent between the event and the publication, but also for consumers, who can do a mobile and personalized consumption on their screens. Due to its ability to continuously adapt to the rhythm of contemporary society, mobile journalism has become more universal and has been confirmed as a form of knowledge insofar as it responds more effectively to consumers’ expectations, in particular young people’s, who are moving away from journalism and thus prevent the generational renewal of readers, something which is fundamental for the media business model.</p>

<p>The ethics of the comic is a relatively new interdisciplinary field of knowledge that is gaining new relevance with the development of a variety of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. The purpose of this article is to review the existing research and show by examples how ethics and values are closely related to the specific functions of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, such as distributing parody content and commenting on it. The main focus of our study is a parody which can be defined as communicative behavior in the form of a text, movement, or even a song, imitating the characteristics or behavior of the object being ridiculed. Unlike a literal quotation, a parody reproduces the original in a distorted form for the purpose of mockery. Within this article modern ethical approaches to the evaluation of parody as well as the main functions of parody in the digital environment are considered. Based on the examples of parody videos on TikTok the particular ways of expressing social problems and cultural traumas by using the comic strategies are identified. Furthermore, the issues of algorithmic censorship concerning such videos as well as the problem of the moral <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of users are discussed.</p>

<p>This essay explores the intersection of communication and culture. It proposes that a new interdisciplinary field of inquiry–a phenomenology of communications–implicates culture in that all communication helps shape and reflects a society’s cultural assumptions and aspirations. In an era of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and electronic communication, the impact on culture has accelerated. Both positive and negative aspects of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> reverberate in American popular culture that Christopher Lasch described as a culture of narcissism and David Brooks calls a culture of the “Big Me.” The essay revisits a documentary about Mike Tyson’s life and career that exemplifies what it means to be an American, renewing a culture that aspires to redeem the American dream of a more perfect union beyond preference and prejudice. It shows also why American culture needs to be transformed from a narcissistic, self-referential, tribal perspective of identity politics and false tolerance toward a culture that respects individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and privacy, reconnects rights and responsibilities, and encourages true diversity, inspired by transcendent norms and ideals worthy of a creature created in the image and likeness of God.</p>

<p>The article is devoted to the formation features of the civic consciousness among the youth in mass culture and media communications. Civil self-consciousness is represented through a system of personal values, a person’s ideas about himself as a citizen, as well as about the state and society where he belongs and in relation to which he is self-determined.
 The purpose of the article is to present how the youth consumes the mass culture products and socio-political media content in the context of the formation process of their civic consciousness. The design of an empirical study is based on the principles of a political and psychological approach. The empirical basis of the research is the materials of the All-Russian survey of the youth aged 18 to 30 years, conducted in 2020 using the formalized interview procedure (n = 1600) and the in-depth interview method (n = 200), as well as the materials of the expert survey (n = 20). The materials reveal attitudes of the youth to printed publications, television content, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> resources, film products, fiction, musical compositions, perception characteristics of the presented socio-political information. The character of media consumption among the youth is determined by the values of freedom and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, justice, truth and truthfulness, and trust in information sources that are significant for them. The lack of critical thinking skills necessary for processing and analyzing a huge array of information determines their primitive perception of the political, the inability to identify political plots and political problems presented in the works of mass culture, a high degree of reactivity to the appearance of various media products. The civic consciousness formation of the youth becomes “broken” and fragmented under the influence of the media space as a factor of political socialization.</p>

<p>My forthcoming book (MIT Press), Virtually Amish, is an ethnographic study of the adoption, design and use of digital communication technologies among members of Old Order Amish communities. This paper explores a section of the book focusing on Amish strategies for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> management. These strategies are in place to protect Amish communities from perceived negative impacts of technologically mediated connectivity. Today it is increasingly common for the Amish to adopt computers, the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and mobile devices in calculated ways to remain competitive in business. Often the use of these devices blends into the personal sphere as well. This research is notable for its empirical observations that show shared values are key to determining patterns of technology use in Amish communities. Data was collected via semi-structured interviews with thought-leaders (business and religious leaders) in Indiana Amish settlements. Findings show that the Amish consider their own cultural, social, political and religious <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in deciding how to engage with a broader social and economic system as technologies are essential to the mediation of these relationships.</p>

<p>In this article, we discuss some of our research with Local Area Networks (LAN) in the context of sound installations or musical performances. Our systems, built on top of Web technologies, enable novel possibilities of collective and collaborative interaction, in particular by simplifying public access to the artwork by presenting the work through the web browser of their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>/tablet. Additionally, such a technical framework can be extended with so-called nano-computers, microprocessors and sensors. The infrastructure is completely agnostic as to how many clients are attached, or how they connect, which means that if the work is available in a public space, groups of friends, or even informally organised flash mobs, may engage with the work and perform the contents of the work at any time, and if available over the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, at any place. More than the technical details, the specific artistic directions or the supposed <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the agents of our systems, this article focuses on how such ‘networks of devices’ interleave with the ‘network of humans’ composed of the people visiting the installation or participating in the concert. Indeed, we postulate that an important point in understanding and describing such proposals is to consider the relation between these two networks , the way they co-exist and entangle themselves through perception and action. To exemplify these ideas, we present a number of case studies, sound installations and concert works, very different in scope and artistic goal, and examine how this interaction is materialised from several standpoints.</p>

<p>Ride-hailing platforms such as Uber, an integral component in the global platform economy, are not only facilitating fluidity and so-called <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of labor; they are also creating an unfair working environment for workers. This phenomenon indicates the strength of a highly temporal and mobile capital, pitted against workers not just in Lagos but around the world. This article adopts James Scott’s notion of everyday resistance in exposing some of the hidden practices of platform drivers in Lagos. It finds that sabotaging and falsely complying through manipulating algorithms and gaming spaces for rewards are facilitated by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and communication networks, are deliberate, hidden practices to subvert algorithmic control. While Lagos is a unique case in the global South, examples from global North cities highlight some peculiarity. A robust qualitative methodology was conducted comprising semistructured interviews, focus group discussions, and participant observations from forty Uber and Bolt trips. Other primary data sources include driver forums, attending driver training sessions and listening to transport radio programs. This article identifies temporal and spatial dynamics in recognizing everyday hidden practices as not always hidden, but dispersed and inconsistent because of the mutual learning capabilities between platform drivers and algorithmic managers. The hidden transcripts of platform drivers delve into public realms and back following, enabling platform drivers to develop new hidden practices, typifying a continuous power struggle in Lagos.</p>

<p>The specificity of contemporary daily life is manifested in the interaction of mass culture with new media forms. Such interactions cause many social and cultural problems, one of which is marital well-being. The paper aims at studying the potential impact of digital space and social networks on marital relationship. The methodological basis of the study is a systematic approach to the study of social objects, interpretive research paradigm, multidisciplinary analysis. Information base of the research are monographs, articles, conference proceedings, reports, blogs. The search was conducted using the following keywords: mass culture, social networks, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, digital space, marital relationship, mental health, psychological well-being, marital satisfaction. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social media</span> offers a diverse experience for each user. The researchers state that this experience is largely positive that explains the growing use of social networks around the world. However, the use of social networks has its significant drawbacks and can threaten marital harmony. Danger factors are information that can arouse suspicion and uncertainty in a relationship; excessive control over partners in social networks, which destroys the sense of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and privacy; excessive time spent in networks and intrusive signs of their use; disclosure of private information; insufficient privacy control; online adulteries that can cause divorce; feelings of worthlessness and dissatisfaction, which often arise as a result of comparing the personal offline reality with the online reality of the actors of communication processes and leads to frustration and depression.</p>

<p>Introduction. According to the well-established opinion of specialists in social sciences and humanities, a person diffracts his selves in the modern world: real spaces (professions, statuses) and virtual (accounts, profiles). In the diffraction of a person through spaces of different order, each “new” self acquires relative <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (a trace of the self in the network, which is present regardless of the attitude to it), and at the same time there remains the connection that, as it were, keeps the self with his digital images and “prints”. The main questions of the article are: in what relation and in relation to what is it possible to talk about the identity of a modern person; what fundamentally significant do the researches on human identity give us today; what do those who ask questions about personal identity in the digital age focus their attention on? In order to answer these questions, let us turn to scientific articles from domestic and foreign journals. This article presents the analytics of publications from Scopus and RSCI databases, in which the problem of personal identity is posed. The purpose of the article is to analyze scientific publications on human identity and summarize the main ideas presented in those publications. Methods. The research is based on general scientific methods, analysis and synthesis, induction, deduction, and abstraction. The author analyzes scientific publications on the basis of the interpretation method and a systematic approach method. Content analysis was used as a method, but it was used within the scope of the purpose. The publications were selected on the basis of the authors’ research of various aspects of identity and the difference in interpreting the phenomenon. Results. Analysis of Scopus publications made it possible to assert that the problem of identity is moving out of the anthropological context and acquiring new technical and technological frameworks (for example, scholars are raising the problem of the digital data identity, digital identification in the context of online transactions). At the same time, the anthropological view of identity remains. It is found for instance in the context of narratives, texts of a person about self that are posted on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. In this context, the concept of “Person Life View” (M. Schechtman) is presented as a variant of a person’s holistic view of the self. The analysis of domestic publications makes it possible to conclude that representatives of social sciences and humanities in their research strive to overcome the dynamic view of a person (dissolving of identity or an absent self), are in search of models of “stability” of identity. Conclusion. Posing the question about the personal identity of a modern person, it seems that the border between the directly human (consciousness and body, for example) and the technical and technological (the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> and the objective world) is becoming more and more destabilized every day. This predetermines the direction of the research. Contemporary scholars, who publish the results of their work in journals included in scientific databases, are faced not only with the problem of substantiating human identity as a theoretical concept that reflects the modern situation, but also with the problem of finding models in which a person is able to embody the idea of “stability” of identity in the everyday life.</p>

<p>Studies on humour in Nigeria have been extensively carried out from the perspectives of stand-up comedy and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">computer-mediated</span> communication. There is a dearth of scholarly enquiries on humour in situation comedies (sitcoms). This paper investigates humour in the interactions of characters in Jenifa’s Diary and Professor JohnBull, with a view to accounting for the manifestations of humour, the humour strategies deployed and the functions that the humorous utterances serve in the sitcoms. The work is situated in Culpeper’s Impoliteness Theory. Eight excerpts from the sitcoms were subjected to pragmatic analysis. Two discourse functions of amusing and castigating are discovered in the data. The former serves the function of facilitating discourse and changing presumed power and status, while the latter serves the function of maintaining one’s own space and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and demanding respect. Allusion, parody, retort, tease, banter and putdown are the humour techniques employed in the sitcoms. The study corroborates the claim of earlier studies that humour in every sphere of language use serves certain functions beyond the interactional need to create amusement.</p>

<p>This study examined the emergence of the phenomenon of hijra among millennials in Aceh, Indonesia, and how this phenomenon has changed the Islamic landscape. This study applied qualitative research methods while the data were collected through observation, in-depth interviews, and documentation. The research subjects consisted of 4 hijra community founders and 10 teenage members of 3 hijra communities in Langsa. These communities include Komunitas Generasi Rabbani (KGR), the Akhwat Ilmu Agama (AKHIA) and the Muslimah Aceh Fillah (MAF). This research integrated Michael Foucault’s theory of power and knowledge and Jurgen Habermas’s theory of public space. The findings of this study indicated that the phenomenon of hijra among them has implications for changes in the Islamic landscape. It was triggered by the rapid development of information technology, such as the use of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> and content production on various digital platforms such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Instagram</span>, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span>, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span>, and YouTube. The impact of this phenomenon fosters the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the millennials to find their interpretations and choose new religious patrons that can be accessed easily through various existing digital platforms. The emergence of these new religious patrons does not come from traditional religious institutions like dayah. Such Islamic expression will expose young Muslims to pop culture and information technology in the future.</p>

<p>China<code>s Belt and Road Initiative is a massive infrastructural project that Ethiopia is encompassed. Yet, in Ethiopia, public opinion over the subject has never been homogenous as there are both apparent faiths that the initiative would positively contribute to Ethiopia’s economy, and suspicions that it is merely China</code>s veiled ambition to accelerate its expansion in global economy and politics, intensifying the concerns that China will not be any different from former colonial powers for African nations. Besides mainstream media coverage, much of the debate over this initiative has increasingly happened on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social networking site</span>s as attributable to their relative accessibility and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. By employing a thematic content analysis of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span> contents generated by opinion technicians during the 2019 Belt and Road Initiative Forum in Beijing, this article examines how opinion technicians over the Ethiopian <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span>sphere discuss the initiative.</p>

<p>In the article, from the standpoint of the theory of network culture and the concept of «symbolic capital» by P. Bourdieu, the processes taking place in visual art practice under the influence of the development of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> are considered. Contemporary art practices and digital art explore the same symbolic capital from different conceptual positions. For contemporary artistic practice, the critical theory and idea of D. Kossuth about the search for the boundaries of art as such, the study of the socio-cultural reality of the here-and-now, and the formulation of the principles of identity remain the main ones. In digital practices, the focus is on the search for an individual style through the study of the structural features of the artistic language itself, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> from verbal commentary. The presence of these vectors is also associated with the redistribution of power capital under the influence of the development of network culture and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, when the museum and gallery sphere is not able to control all the processes taking place in art practice. Not one of the participants in artistic communication possesses the integrity of power. Networks today have become a platform with their own power and authority. At the same time, rules from offline flow into the virtual environment and new restrictions are created, related both to the ontological features of digital logic and to the work of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>ies.</p>

<p>Purpose This research considers the role of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms and their impact on individuals’ eudaimonic well-being, and aims to help develop a social marketing programme in the future that would enable students in Jordanian universities to flourish, by focussing on their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> drivers and overcoming their challenges in an attempt to improve their psychological well-being (PWB). Design/methodology/approach The authors used qualitative research examining lived experiences and behaviours around <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use. The authors conducted 39 semi-structured interviews with students at various universities across Jordan, alongside an online survey with open-ended questions, which were based on six PWB dimensions: environmental mastery, personal growth, purpose in life, self-acceptance, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and positive relationships with others. Findings <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social media</span> use and advertising were found to positively impact students’ self-acceptance and relationships with others but to negatively impact their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. They were found to have different impacts on students’ sense of purpose in life and personal growth, depending on the content shared on their platforms. Originality/value The ethical debate surrounding <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> amongst students indicates that such social marketing programmes might stimulate individuals’ sense of control over their environment, encourage openness to new experiences, and give their lives a beneficial direction. The study makes recommendations for the creation of an evidence-based social marketing programme that is extrinsically focussed on increasing resilience, creating an audience persona and building awareness of PWB.</p>

<p>Social network has become an important channel for people to obtain information.Trusted user information behavior is the key to build <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>space security. A dynamic reputation evaluation method based on supervision feedback of user information behavior is helpful to promote social network self-discipline and achieve good community <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The comprehensive reputation evaluation of each node integrates identity and behavior reputation. And the reputation is dynamically updated by setting the new node evaluation period and phased update mechanism. Identity reputation is calculated by information disclosure and network characteristics; Behavior reputation is calculated by information release and forwarding, and rewards or punishments will be given to self-correction of information behavior or blocking of bad information. The simulation results show that compared with the traditional trust evaluation mechanism, setting rewards and punishments guidance can improve the accuracy of reputation evaluation. At the same time, reputation incentive can also inhibit the interaction of bad information while promoting the consciousness of reporting.</p>

<p>The twentieth century was marked by a large number of various kinds of changes that affected almost all spheres of society. New phenomena began to appear in sociological science, the explanation of which caused difficulties and required sociological theory to rethink the methods and analytical models used by it. Among the factors that have had an active influence on the evolution of the network concept, first of all, we should include the development of transport infrastructure, telephone networks and the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. The concept of a network has been increasingly used to explain social phenomena. This approach in modern sociology is called “network”, which, according to many researchers, is quite productive, as it has a high potential in solving existing problems and in forming a response to the emerging tasks of modern sociological science. It should be noted that in the domestic sociological tradition and in applied research, the possibilities of using the “network approach” remain poorly understood. Many Russian sociologists do not include this approach in the focus of their attention. This article presents a comparative theoretical analysis of the existing areas of the network approach. The main aspects of comparison are: the time and context of appearance, the main provisions, the methodology and methods of empirical research. Common features and differences between the analyzed areas are highlighted. At the end of the article, a conclusion is formulated about the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of each of the designated areas. Based on this fact, it is assumed that the term “network approach” is used solely as a collective name for different theories and approaches that operate with the concept of a network in different senses.</p>

<p>The work was carried out in line with the current idea of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> as a global media that interacts with various sign systems and influences the structural and compositional features of the verbal text. The relevance of the study is due to the formation of the concept of intermediality in the context of a new cultural direction, called “metavirtualism”. The aim of the article is to characterize the principles underlying the structure and composition of the network poetic “book”. Russian-language poetic cycles are considered, the structural and compositional features and expressive means of which are associated with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> technologies. Such aspects as the type of intermediality and ways of organizing the structure and composition of the network “book” are analyzed; the reader’s way of getting acquainted with the work and the degree of freedom of this way; manifestation of the category of ephemerality. It is concluded that technological poetry, paradoxically, strengthens traditional book forms, but also has an independent value, visualizing poetic images and metaphors. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> technologies can be “embedded” into the structure and composition of a poetry book at various levels: it can be relative <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>; interaction at the level of a conceptual metaphor explicated with the help of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> media (Google maps); almost complete fusion of media.</p>

<p>With the introduction of personal computer systems and subsequent technologies that make flow of information fast and efficient, a new age emerged that is often termed as ‘digital age’ or ‘digital era’. During this age, the capabilities of individuals and societies to access and use multiple forms of convergent media content got enhanced manifold. It also led to a revolution in the industry of ‘news and views’. This convergent media is popularly known as the ‘New Media’. While this new (digital) media is taking new shapes across the globe, it is still struggling for survival in one part of the world called Kashmir. Due to frequent suspensions of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> service in the valley, the digital media of Kashmir faces multiple challenges that are mostly unknown to other parts of the world. During 2010, 2012 and 2016 uprisings in Kashmir and more recently in 2019–2020, when Indian government decided to scrap the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and special status of the valley, this place was excluded digitally that had a huge setback not only to the growth of New Media, but on education, health and economy as well. This paper studies this digital exclusion and its impact on journalism and mass communication in Kashmir.</p>

An extensive use of the concept of online study-ing and the development of its technical internal system capabilities have led to significant changes in the understanding of this term.

However, this definition no longer covers all aspects of this phenomenon. Accor-ding to the field of Online Psychology we mean online studying not as a specific network of interconnected computers and mobile devices, or even a network of web-sites with channels and communication devices between components with appropriate programs and protocols, as networks together with social services based on them, which attract people and / or ensure their activities. conclusions.

<p>Abstract How <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> impacts the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of its users is a topic of increasing focus. However, much of the literature that explores these impacts fails to engage in depth with the philosophical literature on <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. This has resulted in a failure to consider the full range of impacts that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> might have on <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. A deeper consideration of these impacts is thus needed, given the importance of both <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> as a moral concept and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> as a feature of contemporary life. By drawing on this philosophical literature, we argue that <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is broadly a matter of developing <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> competencies, having authentic ends and control over key aspects of your own life, and not being manipulated, coerced, and controlled by others. We show how the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of users of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> can be disrespected and harmed through the control that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> can have over its users’ data , attention , and behaviour . We conclude by discussing various recommendations to better regulate <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>.</p>

<p>The important dramatization of public scenes through <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> can be observed within the paradigm of the Networked Society proposed by Castells (2003). Networked social movements mobilize their efforts to foster and balance public debate in their favor. In this article, we aim to understand how the communication strategies on #UERJResiste <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> page in defense of the State University of Rio de Janeiro – UERJ – was presented in this public arena&nbsp;(Cefaï, 2017a, 2017b), in the period from January to April, 2017. 266 posts were collected to outline an ethnographic description (Laplantine, 2004) of the social movement. An interview was also held with one of the page’s administrators to understand how the content is produced in order to compose a situational analysis. As a result, we identified four categories that also constitute communication strategies: media politics, discourse of resisting, educational shares, and poetics of identity. In view of the privatization discourses of education and the attacks on its <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and its professionals, we understand #UERJResiste as a protagonist with an important narrative to be disseminated, reflected, and discussed in the defense of the Brazilian Public University. Among the main contributions to this study are networked social movements from an ethnographic perspective of a public arena. We also highlight an understanding of strategic communication in the civic dynamics, rebounding the importance of the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of universities for democratic consolidation and citizen participation.</p>

<p>The reciprocal exchanges of messages, likes, and pictures on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> are typical expressions of mobile youth culture. After all, it is well-established that young people’s disclosure practices support their efforts to maintain relationships, gain <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and, by large, consolidate a place in the world. What is often missing, however, is an exploration of how the specific socio-cultural contexts of ethno-religious minority youths shape and are shaped by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> appropriations. Therefore, we conducted a 15-month ethnographic study among ethno-religious minority youths in which we investigated networked gift-giving practices. We stress the notion of “networked” because the results illustrate how these young people appropriate the amplified visibility of their relational maintenance behaviors on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> in order to negotiate status and social ties. We connect these findings to the concept of a “distrustful society” as the participants hold a general distrust in society due to experiences of racism and marginalization.</p>

<p>Background Adolescence and emerging adulthood are critical periods for an individual’s sexual identity development. The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> has become a primary avenue for gay identity exploration. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> in Chinese young gay male’s sexual identity development. Methods Qualitative interviews were conducted with 37 gay males aged 16 to 29. Data were analyzed using grounded theory methods. Results Three categories of identity development in relation to use of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> were identified: (1) Gay identity confirming , which includes verifying same-sex attraction and connecting the attraction feeling to gay identity through consumption of pornography, Tanbi (boy’s love) materials, and searching for information online. (2) Gay identity practicing , includes interacting with the gay community to gain understandings of gay subcultures and make close gay friends, engaging in same-sex sexual and romantic relationship development through online group and interpersonal interactions. The <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> practice impact on an individual’s cognition and behavior by presenting same-sex sexual contact is normal and common, facilitating longing for a romantic relationship, and facilitating relationship development; and (3) Gay identity coping , includes increasing self-acceptance of gay identity, gaining a sense of belonging in the gay community, increasing <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in sexual and romantic relationship development, and growing consideration of coming out to parents. Young gay males’ coping efficacy was gained through the lessons learned from identity practice. Conclusion The findings indicate that an individual’s <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> practice facilitates gay identity confirmation, enriches identity practice, and promotes the transition from self-identification to identity disclosure and integration. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> practice also threatens to young gay males’ sexual risk behavior, emotional hurts from failed romantic relationships. Interventions including sexual identity education and healthy <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> use strategies need to be developed tailored to the developmental characteristics.</p>

<p>This paper investigates the relationship between campaign communications and the discursive frames articulated more generally by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> users in the context of the 2012 U.S. presidential election. It identifies campaign frames with respect to the clusters of terms produced by the campaigns themselves and identifies the extent to which these same clusters prevail over time throughout the campaign in the tweets produced by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Twitter</span> users more generally. The findings suggest that some frames fail to resonate at all while others prevail primarily with the intensification of campaign communications. These results indicate that tweets produced by the general public are neither wholly steered by elites nor wholly autonomous. Rather they appear dialogical.</p>

<p>﻿leader was a mediator. Partha <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Chat</span>- terjee expanded on this latter point by asking Chakravarty what, in his view, would constitute change. Was not the worker-trade union leader relationship an essentially new one? The trade union leader had, in fact, a bourgeois understanding of his role as a political representative of the people. Dipesh Chakravarty replied that although there were obvious empirical differences between rural zamindar-dominated society and urban industrial society, relationships of power and authority continued to be similar. He accepted that his analysis was pessimistic, but in India there were few grounds for optimism. It was one thing to believe in the possibility of a change for the better, another to argue that it was coming in the near future. He accepted the possibility of change, but: not the immediate likelihood, and this essay was an attempt to understand why this was so. He felt that Marxists who analysed all problems in terms of structure and superstructure tended to be blind to the critical problem of culture, and he argued that there is a great need for a theory of culture in Marxist writing. In conclusion, we may say that the papers presented at this conference showed a greater awareness of the need to analyse the relationship of collaboration between subaltern and elite classes as well as that of conflict. Other elements which came out in the whole discussion were the need to combat narrow economistic explanations for subaltern actions, the need to focus strongly on political relationships, the relative <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> which exists between the thought and actions of elite and subaltern classes, and the need to understand better the nature of the tenacious hold of culture within the Indian social formation. The study of subaltern consciousness and culture, it was brought out, was central to the whole project. In this, the authors of these papers accepted the need to approach popular beliefs and understandings through a more sophisticated analysis of texts. This is, perhaps, one of the directions in which we may expect the subaltern studies project to move in the future.</p>
