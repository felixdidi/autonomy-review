<p>Continuing working until the pension age? Relations between work characteristics and the estimated work ability Continuing working until the pension age? Relations between work characteristics and the estimated work ability Gedrag &amp; Organisatie, volume 24, November 2011, nr. 4, pp.&nbsp;392-410.The Dutch and Belgian government attempts to let employees work longer with financial measures in order to solve the threatening shortness of labor forces. Until today this approach seems to be less successful. For this reason this study investigated, within the frame of the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model, whether the job characteristics workload, emotional and physical demands, cognitive demands, learning opportunities, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and relation with the supervisor are related to someone’s expectation to be able to continue his job until the pension age. This study found several new practical and theoretical insights. It turned out that there were significant relations for workload, emotional and physical demands, learning opportunities and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> with someone’s expectation to be able to continue his job until the pension age. Psychological exhaustion as well as work pleasure had a mediating role in these relations. Using multiple mediation model analysis the research model was tested on the data of 2107 employees of 50 year or older of the Flemish Workability Monitor 2007.</p>

<p>ABSTRACT Financial planner perceptions are made up of a complex neural blend of client management qualities, client demographic qualities, personal qualities, business practice qualities, and job qualities. This study empirically assesses perceptions of the financial planning professional to find those factors seen to be most important and least important contributing to financial planner self reported success. The data utilized within this study were gathered via a survey instrument developed and administered in an online format during the months of June and July 2008. A total of 403 geographically diverse respondents (4% response rate) who are members of the FPA and agree to receive <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> from the organization answered the survey. The final sample used after significant non-response cases were eliminated was 349 respondents (3.5%). Findings of this study indicate that client relationships, wealth of client served, use of ethical practices, ability to empathize, number of clients served, client referrals, and job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> are among the most important contributors to financial planner perceived success. (ProQuest: … denotes formula omitted.) INTRODUCTION The financial planning profession provides a unique research opportunity for scholars and practitioners alike. Little if any empirical research has been conducted to this point conceptualizing and evaluating career success dimensions within financial planning. Career success dimensions such as client management, client demographic, personal, job scope, and business practice factors will provide further insight into the perceptions of the financial planner, their job functions, and their self reported level of success. The purpose of this research is to analyze perceptions of these factors and to evaluate which factors are perceived to contribute most to the financial planner. Research within financial planning enhances the opportunity for working world solutions to be developed for the benefit of the profession and those who work daily as financial planners. LITERATURE REVIEW In the 1950’ s, noted social psychologist Fritz Heider developed a theory explaining how individuals attribute behavior of themselves and others. Heider’ s work, known as attribution theory, is a cognitive theory associated with success and interpersonal relationships (Heider, 1958). Attribution theory is the exploration of an individual’s awareness of cause and effect scenarios and how the outcomes of such scenarios affect the individual’s perception of usefulness. Heider proposed that people strive for prediction and understanding of daily events in order to give their lives stability and predictability (Heider). Fullin and Mills (1995) write of attribution theory as applied to the field of sports, whereby athletes use awareness of cause and effect scenarios to adjust performance output. Attribution theory divides the way an individual attributes causes to events into two distinct categories: external and internal. External attribution assigns causality to an outside factor, such as client demographics or job qualities, in the current study, or competition in the sports analogy. Internal attribution assigns causality to inside factors of the person, such as personal factors and business practices in the current study, or ability and luck in the sports analogy. Thus, when one measures his or herself or compares his or herself to others, attribution theory is engaged by way of comparison. One may make these comparisons and attribute differences to either internal or external deficiencies. Once the deficiencies are known, the individual can adjust the internal or external factors to attain a desired state. In the case of an athlete, once deficiencies are known, adjustments to ability, effort, and task difficulty can be made. Mittra, Potts, and LaBrecque (2005) argue the financial planner is at times like a football quarterback moderating the plays of financial life around the key planning areas in a strategic manner. …</p>

<p>This article compares instruments which IT-firms use to integrate their business consultants – esp.&nbsp;the way monitoring and coordination of activities works. It is based empirically on interviews with consultants and managers of consulting units of a U.S. American firm in Germany, the Swiss subsidiary of a German IT-firm and business units of this firm located in Germany. A <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netic organizational model provides the theoretical frame.

<p>Knowledge issues are central to governance choice. Organization structure influences knowledge flows and costs of knowledge creation and exchange inside the firm. Yet the question of how a firm’s internal structure affects its governance choice for new activities has received scant empirical attention. We examine the role of internal structure, specifically unit <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and lateral coordination, in a firm’s governance decision for new, knowledge-intensive activities. The findings show that internal structure is a ‘shift parameter’ that affects governance choice by moderating the relationship between task complexity and degree of integration. The empirical setting is the U.S. banking industry and its adoption of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> banking. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following the Rena grounding and oil spill in the Bay of Plenty, New Zealand, an Incident Command Centre was established which, among other tasks, coordinated a volunteer clean-up effort. We interviewed volunteers and organisers to gain insight into the efficacy of the volunteer coordination effort. Volunteers praised the system of communication and the involvement of indigenous groups. They expressed a desire for better training, more flexibility and community <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, a quicker uptake of volunteer support, and the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. Locating the Incident Command Centre in a single site aided interaction between experts, and the sharing of resources. Overall, the volunteer coordination was considered a success.</p>

<p>Through in-depth interviews with Taiwanese newspaper workers, this paper illustrates the “de-skilling” effects of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICTs) on journalists. In recent years, Taiwanese reporters have experienced an increase in workload and an intensification of managerial control due to the introduction of new technologies in the newsroom. Using ICTs in the workplace consequently has harmed journalists’ working conditions and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Moreover, ICTs have led to a trivialization of reporting tasks and devaluation of reporters’ experience and knowledge. The degradation of reporting work resulting from the use of ICTs has enabled managers at Taiwanese newspapers to hire young employees to fill the jobs of experienced reporters and to reduce salary costs.</p>

<p>Established firms often create new business divisions in response to new ways of competing, such as those based on disruptive innovations. Using a sample of daily newspapers and their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> divisions, this study examines the corporate characteristics of orientation, attention, and control and venture management team characteristics of vision, experience, and collective efficacy and their interactive effects on the overall performance of the new division. Findings demonstrate that vision and collective efficacy are related to venture outcomes, orientation affects the experience and vision to venture performance relationships, attention enhances the vision and collective efficacy to performance relationships, and decision <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> influences the experience and collective efficacy to venture performance relationships. Overall, the results of this study imply that specific venture management team characteristics and corporate characteristics may be tailored to improve chances of meeting specific performance targets and achieving overall venture success.</p>

<p>This paper examines the way that different types of workers deploy strategies of control in concert with and in resistance to <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICTs). Existing research on the effects of ICTs for knowledge workers has illustrated the ways they can lead to practices of overwork and work–life spillover. However, the dearth of studies on service workers and ICT means that we have a limited understanding of their role across different segments of the workforce. Drawing on interviews with service workers and knowledge workers, I examine how they use ICTs to shape their experiences of work. The study finds the two groups deployed ICTs in different ways, and employed different ICT-centric strategies to control the temporal and emotional demands of their labor. The service workers deployed strategies of everyday resistance in concert with their ICTs to gain a feeling of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> within the power structures of their workplaces. The knowledge workers deployed strategies of inaccessibility …</p>

<p>Employee temporal flexibility is a common strategy aimed at assisting workers to reduce conflict between work and family life. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and communication technolog</span>ies can facilitate this by enabling employees to attend to various personal life matters during the workday. Critical to utilising such flexibility is a degree of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> over how work time can be used. However, in organisational settings, such <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is tempered by structural and normative constraints. This article examines how environments of constrained <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> affect employees’ ability to use time flexibly. Case study data of engineers and managers working in the telecommunications industry is presented. This reveals two findings. Firstly, environments of constrained <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> limit when during the workday employees can engage in personal mediated communications. Secondly, when personal time is inserted into such contexts, the quantitative and qualitative character of this time is affected.</p>

<p>ABSTRACT Is personal <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use at work primarily the domain of lower-status employees, or do individuals higher up the organizational hierarchy engage in this activity at equal or even greater levels? We posit that higher workplace status is associated with significant incentives and greater opportunities for personal <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use. We test this hypothesis using data collected via a recent national telephone survey (n = 1,024). Regression analyses demonstrate that, contrary to conventional wisdom, higher-status employees, as measured by occupation status, job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, income, education, and gender, engage in significantly more frequent personal <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> use at work.</p>

<p>Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to show that the way home‐based <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> businesses (HBIBs) are operated and the reasons for which they are started enable HBIBs to bring about variety, and to argue that this variety has a broader impact on the industry and the economy.Design/methodology/approach – The paper adopts a multiple case study approach, studying the best practices of eight HBIBs.Findings – The study finds that HBIBs generate variety because of the unique way in which they operate, and because of the reasons why they are started. How HBIBs operate can be captured in the acronym SMILES: Speed, Multiple income, Inexpensive, LEan, and Smart. They are founded (amongst other motives) for reasons of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, freedom and independence. Both aspects – the how and why – of HBIBs are conducive to the creation of variety as they facilitate trial‐and‐error commercialisation of authentic ideas.Research limitations/implications – Five theoretical perspectives posit that variety is important for the indus…</p>

<p>Many opportunities exist to combine different models in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netics and systems field to assist groups and organizations to be more effective. Brings together three models, the Viable System Model, Socio‐Technical Systems and Total Quality Management, to consider their potential usefulness in an integrated approach. It examines their common roots in the concepts of systems and environments, communications, the modelling process, variety, feedback and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Their differences of emphasis and some limitations are also noted. A suggestion is made regarding how they might be brought together in a single application using the Viable Systems Model as one of three possible frameworks. Other systems models and where they might fit within this framework are also noted. Finally, co‐operation and experiment among practitioners of different models is urged as having great potential benefit to client organizations.</p>

<p>Management control of professional employees such as engineers and scientists leads to a state of conflict in the business organization. To management, the control of human resources implies the limiting of individualistic behavior of subordinates in order to realize the objectives of the firm. In contrast, the industrial scientist, even as a subordinate in an organizational hierarchy, believes that control as applied to him should allow for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and independence as attributes of professionalism in his work environment.</p>
<p>In this paper we examine various approaches to managerial control—traditional, bureaucratic, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netic, and behavioral—and their application to the engineer-scientist as the carrier of professional values in the work culture. A successful manager in this environment must create a work climate without emphasis on formal mechanisms of control and direction. Recent research indicates that to this effect optimum supervisory behavior involves neither excessive direction nor <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> but frequent interaction with industrial scientists as participants in decision making.</p>
<p>We conclude that management of industrial scientists in relation to their professional values should take place within the networks of informal organizational relationships. It involves the application of normative managerial control based upon the exercise of self-imposed sanctions by the industrial scientists themselves, and of colleague authority by their managers relying on communication and information for compliance with organization’s objectives and goals.</p>

<p>As China seriously lacks trained and experienced personnel at its current stage of development, management consultancy may be adopted as an economical solution to improve efficiency and performance. However, as institutional theory suggests, it is likely that the adoption of management consultancy in China is driven more by mimetic isomorphism factors than by actual performance considerations. Using data from a survey of 219 listed Chinese firms, our results suggest that there are significant positive effects from mimetic isomorphism factors and adoption of management accounting and controls and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y. Our study provides strong evidence that the adoption of management consultancy has a positive effect on firm performance, yet we cannot conclude that management consultancy is adopted to improve firm performance. Moreover, state ownership held by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) has a significant and positive effect on management consultancy adoption, whereas state ownership held by government agencies does not. One interpretation is that firms controlled by SOEs have acquired increased <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and become more innovative.</p>

<p>PURPOSE: We explored these issues qualitatively among sedentary university employees recruited to a 10-week randomised controlled trail. The trial compared walking routes, walking within daily tasks and controls on daily step totals, showing that, compared to controls, interventions resulted in <span class="citation" data-cites="1000">@1000</span> extra steps per day. METHOD: Fifteen participants representing both trial arms contributed semi-structured interviews at post-intervention assessments, supported by six recorded peer debriefings. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and subject to inductive coding. RESULTS: Increased walking at work resulted in an overall effect of ‘Improved sense of self within the organisation’. Attention provided by pedometers, physiological monitoring and weekly e-mail motivational messages were all considered important contributors in producing this effect and were seen as an institutional investment in staff. Increased walking helped to feel healthier (‘When steps were higher, it was obvious I felt better’), generated <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and provided variety within normal work days. Walking within daily tasks helped to establish much-valued face-to-face contact with colleagues (‘Talking to colleagues in person was more effective than <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s it was more sociable’). This also simplified completion of daily tasks, while walking together on routes helped colleagues to resolve inter-personal tensions. However, reducing time spent at desks caused concern for some supervisors who questioned employee productivity; this challenge was rarely offered to more senior employees. CONCLUSION: Extra walking at work, however it was achieved, produced a powerful effect on employee morale which was linked to improved emotional control and mental focus, better mood and increased energy. These collective effects are central to improved morale and subjective estimates of more effective work performance based on increased walking during the working day.</p>

<p>While advances in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) have diminished the constraint of location, created new outsourced models and show a promise of employee flexibility, it is not very clear how implementation of ICT affects the work–family balance for employees working in these new industries. In this conceptual paper, we explore the effect of ICT on employees in the context of the software services industry in India. We unpack the role of characteristics of service interaction in determining whether the use of ICT leads to improved or deterioration in work–family balance by investigating factors such as frequency and duration of interaction, and the temporal and cultural distance between the service provider employees and client. We argue that while the ICT media, geographical and temporal distance may enhance the need for longer customer interaction and work time, employee <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> can potentially help harness the flexibility of the ICT advances to mitigate the detrimental impact on employ…</p>

<p>A review of the academic research in corporate social responsibility shows little work on small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in the U.S. whereas considerable work in this domain has been conducted in the European context. This study seeks to make a contribution to the research void by addressing one particular area of social responsibility in the U.S. context. Specifically, we employ Ajzen’s reasoned action approach to begin to build an understanding of what promotes leaders of SMEs to reduce waste. This study addresses several questions: What are the attitudes of owners and managers of SMEs toward waste reduction practices for their organizations? How are stakeholder interests toward waste reduction perceived? And, are leaders of SMEs influenced by their industrial environment? The authors utilized an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> survey directed to owners and managers of SMEs with greater than 5, but less than 500 employees in the telephony, construction, pulp and paper products, textiles, and agriculture industries. 377 <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s were opened and 104 completed surveys were obtained. The survey instrument was developed from the theoretical perspective of Isaac Ajzen’s (1991) Theory of Planned Behavior in Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, p.&nbsp;179-211. Results from a partial least squares analysis of the data suggest that there is a strong and significant relationship between the normative, attitudinal, and control constructs with an individual’s intention to be a socially responsible SME. This finding suggests that efforts to influence SME owners and managers to implement waste reduction activities need focus on changing individual attitudes.</p>

<p>By the nature of the work, television news workers face a time famine: too much to do in too little time. The famine has been compounded in recent years as local newsrooms produce content for two-screen and three-screen audiences. Chaos theory says that even during chaotic times there are constants, such as deadlines and breaking news obligations. This study of 877 broadcast journalists examines their perceptions of work quality in light of organizational support, job satisfaction, work overload and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Results indicate that organizational support, job satisfaction and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> are significant, positive predictors of work quality. Additionally, 81% of news workers said they work differently from a few years ago, with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>/online obligations and doing-more-with-less consuming much of their time. In the meantime, diminished quality is a rising concern.</p>

However, the query how absorptive capacity transforms R&amp;D investment into firm innovation, in the context of autonomous R&amp;D climate remains unclear. Using 165 firms in the Taiwan’s <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y industry, the results indicate that absorptive capacity partially mediates the relationship between R&amp;D investment and firm innovation. Absorptive capacity accounts for 36% effects of R&amp;D investment on firm innovation.

<p>In this paper we examine satisfaction with work-life balance among non-standard workers. Using unique data from 6,009 Russian-language <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> freelancers, who are typically both autonomous contractors and teleworkers, we make two key contributions. We found evidence to support the demand-resource model among self-employed professionals who typically have <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and control over their time, although these processes differ somewhat by gender. We also argue that overall life satisfaction is a significant influence on satisfaction with work-life balance and also acts as a mediator for the influence of some demands and resources on both male and female freelancers’ satisfaction with work-life balance. Implications for future research and social policy are discussed.</p>

The study analyzes data of the 2008 Networked Workers Survey sponsored by the Pew <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> &amp; American Life Project. The results demonstrate that job characteristics explain a large, significant portion of the variance of POC at work. The findings suggest that for jobs with high knowledge intensity, managing POC could be approached from a work–life balance perspective. The study also suggests that changes in work structure, job variety, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> could have significant implications for managing POC activities in the wired workplace.</p>

<p>In the past decade, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Smartphone</span>s have been developed and increasingly integrated with people’s lives not only for social use, but for professional use as well. Many researchers claim that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Smartphone</span>s can have negative consequences in the workplace such as lowering productivity, separating people from their realities, bringing stress from personal issues to work, and creating bad manners. Companies, however, have a difficult time mandating a policy in regards to prohibiting the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Smartphone</span>s. Therefore, CEOs and corporate leaders should encourage their employees to use their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Smartphone</span>s as tools for increasing their company’s efficiency.

<p>The shift toward “networked work” in the United States—spurred on by globalization, technological changes, and the reorganization of work activities—has important consequences for job quality that require further investigation. Using nationally representative data from the 2008 Networked Worker Survey, we examine how teamwork, telework, and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y use are associated with, and positively and significantly predict, job decision latitude (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and skill development). The results imply that networked work helps enhance job decision latitude partly through greater network connectivity (social capital). Furthermore, the contribution of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y use to job decision latitude is contingent on its perceived benefits and on the organization of work into teams. These findings therefore help deepen our understanding of how the changing character of work affects worker control in contemporary workplaces.</p>

In this study we analyse different variables of the implementation process (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, retention, interaction, cultural similarity) in three acquisitions. We observe that the degree of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> granted to the acquired firm is influenced by the nature of the knowledge to be transferred, whereas retention and the means of interaction are not. The results with regard to cultural similarity are not conclusive.</p>

<p>Abstract Although prior studies suggest that technology competencies play a significant role in firm innovation and competitiveness, what and how technology competencies interacted with competitive environment affect firm innovation has not been fully understood. This paper fills this research gap through a questionnaire survey of 165 firms together with a number of interviews drawn from the Taiwan’s <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) industry. The results suggest that capabilities of exploring or exploiting technological opportunities, core technology capability, and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of R&amp;D decisions are particularly important to firm innovation in a highly competitive environment, whereas over commitments to existing technologies may constrain a firm’s innovation especially in such environment. Moreover, different types of competitive environment require different types of technological competencies to enhance firm innovativeness. This paper contributes to the existing theory by examining the joint effect of technology competency and competitive environment on a firm’s innovation.</p>

<p>Each year, organizations sustain a multi-billion-dollar productivity loss because of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> abuse: the use of workplace <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> for non-work purposes. Accordingly, they have implemented various forms of top-down monitoring, in which an authority controls employees’ online behavior. The efficacy of this “vertical” control system, however, is less clear than its unintended consequence: demotivated employees. Drawing from research on self-determination and control systems, the current research examined whether two “horizontal” control systems—peer monitoring and peer communication—would mitigate <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> abuse with fewer motivational consequences. Using a new virtual environment and a survey, three studies compared the systems’ objective and subjective effects, documenting an underlying psychological mechanism: <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Consistent with predictions, the results suggested that both horizontal systems can reduce abuse as readily as the vertical system, but they exact fewer motivational costs by supporting a…</p>

<p>In this article we prevent bureaucracy as the result of psychological defenses in operation. In fact, tendencies for bureaucratization of human relations in the workplace are the result of externalized interpersonal defense mechanisms to avoid personalization of the workplace and face-a-face interactions. Self-systems are learned defensive activities against anxiety and fear caused by the loss of security of self-esteem. A threatening (potentially anxiety ridden) environment, perceived by the person or group of people, will activate security operations of self-systems, resulting in some distortion of reality and cognition. The psychoanalysis of organizations highlights the frequently paradoxical behavior of managers and workers. We conceptualize paradox as the simultaneous existence in the organization of two inconsistent states, such as empowerment and conformance: old and new. We show that in the organizational context, there are the intended consequences of the action, which are directed toward improving performance and profit. On the other hand, there are the unintended consequences of the same action, which may actually undermine performance, profit and cancel out the intended positive consequences. In our case study, we analyze the paradox produced by the implementation of an <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> Security System at a Brazilian High Tech Company. We exemplify a paradox between the dimensions bureaucratic control X <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. This paradox increased the organization´ stress level and social actors self defense mechanisms. We will describe and analyze some of de unintended consequences produced by social actors self defense mechanisms and resistance-to-change phenomenon in this case.

<p><span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and communication technolog</span>y is advancing rapidly and has led to the fundamental changes in the world community. Activities, jobs, skills, cultures, needs etc. have been impressed and transformed by this technology. Undoubtedly, entrepreneurship has a major role in the development of these technologies; however, these technologies also influence the entrepreneurship and in other words, have created a modern entrepreneurship. In this regard, information and communications are two basic required tools for every entrepreneurial activity. Today, information technology has spread widely in the community and has integrated into all aspects of life. Entrepreneurship is the process of creating something new by spending a lot of time and effort and accepting financial, emotional and social risks to gain financial resources, job satisfaction and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. In fact, information technology is considered as the driving force by which, in addition to mobilizing the job and employment wheels, leads to the economic growth and dynamics of community and the creation of a new kind of economy, that is called knowledge-based economy. This article has tried to analyze the concepts of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y and entrepreneurship and also has considered the interaction of information technology and entrepreneurship.

<p>This article compares the work of fashion models and “new media workers” (those who work in the relatively new medium of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> as dot-com workers) in order to highlight the processes of entrepreneurial labor in culture industries. Based on interviews and participant-observation in New York City, we trace how entrepreneurial labor becomes intertwined with work identities in cultural industries both on and off the job. While workers are drawn to the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, creativity and excitement that jobs in these media industries can provide, they have also come to accept as normal the high risks associated with this work. Diffused through media images, this normalization of risk serves as a model for how workers in other industries should behave under flexible employment conditions. Using interview data from within the fashion media and the dot-com world, we discuss eight forces that give rise to the phenomenon of entrepreneurial labor: the cultural quality of cool, creativity, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, self-investment, comp…</p>

<p>The model developed in this article explains differences in the division of labour across firms as a result of computer technology adoption. Changes in the division of labour result from reduced production time and improved communication possibilities. The first shifts the division of labour towards generic structures, while the latter enhances specialisation. Our estimates for a sample of Dutch establishments in the period 1990‐6 suggest that productivity gains have been the main determinant for shifts in the division of labour. These productivity gains induced skill upgrading, while in firms gaining from improved communication possibilities specialisation increased and skill requirements have fallen. The rapid spread of computer technology has led to substantial changes in the division of labour and a shift in the demand for labour in favour of skilled workers. Mostly these changes have been accompanied by flatter organisational structures, larger <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for workers or workgroups, the application of innovative human resource management practices and so on. There are also less typical examples where computerisation is associated with increased specialisation (e.g., the rapid increase of call-centres), scripting of communication with clients and stricter procedures. Although the empirical relationship between <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) adoption and organisational change has been well-documented, disagreement remains about the reasons why computerisation provides firms with incentives to change the structure of their organisation and the skill requirements of their workforce.</p>

<p>Our research examines how knowledge professionals use mobile <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> devices to get their work done and the implications of such use for their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to control the location, timing, and performance of work. We found that knowledge professionals using mobile <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> devices to manage their communication were enacting a norm of continual connectivity and accessibility that produced a number of contradictory outcomes. Although individual use of mobile <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> devices offered these professionals flexibility, peace of mind, and control over interactions in the short term, it also intensified collective expectations of their availability, escalating their engagement and thus reducing their ability to disconnect from work. Choosing to use their mobile <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> devices to work anywhere/anytime—actions they framed as evidence of their personal <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>—the professionals were ending up using it everywhere/all the time, thus diminishing their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in practice. This <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> paradox reflected professionals’ ongoing navigation of the tension between their interests in personal <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> on the one hand and their professional commitment to colleagues and clients on the other. We further found that this dynamic has important unintended consequences—reaffirming and challenging workers’ sense of themselves as autonomous and responsible professionals while also collectively shifting the norms of how work is and should be performed in the contemporary workplace.</p>

<p>The use of monitoring devices (data collection) in business organizations is facilitated through New <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies (NICT) such as fingerprint, facial or eyes biometric, time clocks, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span> surveillance, remote tracking of employees via GPS, and others. While standard economic theory advocates the use of incentive systems and surveillance to increase performance at work, some empirical studies show a fall in the level and quality of effort after the introduction of monitoring. Using self-determination theory (SDT), we explain this phenomenon by the negative impact of “monitoring systems extensiveness” on employees’ intrinsic motivation (IM). We hypothesize the mediation of this impact by the degree to which employees perceive their supervisors as being “<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> supportive”. We also investigate the possibility of a moderating effect of “employees’ beliefs about the purposes of devices for monitoring” on the relationships between “monitoring systems extensiveness”, “perception of supervision” and “intrinsic motivation”. We test these hypotheses using a questionnaire, collected in France, from 579 employees having at least one supervisor. Developing a structural equation model, we find: firstly, a significant crowding out effect of IM by monitoring; secondly, this crowding out effect is significantly mediated by employees’ perception of supervision; thirdly, we confirm a strong positive relation between an <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> supportive supervision and IM. Finally, we do not find any significant moderation by employees’ beliefs about the purposes attributed to monitoring devices.</p>

We derive a simple agency model of the interaction between a local branch manager and the headquarters, which yields an estimable equation for the optimal delegation of authority. Using a unique and specifically tailored dataset including about 300 Italian banks, we show that banks equipped with more ICT capital and resorting to credit scoring delegate more decision-making power to their local branch managers. These results are robust to many additional controls, including instrumental variable estimation. The effects on decentralization are strengthened for those banks that jointly hold higher ICT capital endowments and adopt credit scoring.</p>

<p>We draw on the geographical concepts of social space, territoriality, and distantiation to examine an apparent tension inherent in telework: i.e., using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies to work away from traditional workplaces can give employees a greater sense of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> while simultaneously placing new constraints on the way they conduct themselves in settings that were previously beyond the reach of managerial control. We draw on a longitudinal case study of a Belgian biopharmaceutical company to show how technical and professional teleworkers developed broadly similar strategies of spatiotemporal scaling to cope with this tension. We conclude by considering how these scaling strategies allowed employees to cope with the demands of ‘hybrid’ work that is conducted both at home and in traditional settings.</p>

<p>AbstractThe goal of this paper is to analyze the association between <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies (ICT) and Advanced Manufacturing Technologies (AMT) and the adoption of a number of new work practices, such as job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, teamwork, job breadth, suggestion systems and involvement groups. Special attention is paid to examining whether the strength of the association with new work practices is the same for the two technologies. The data used in the empirical part of the research come from a survey conducted in 281 Spanish manufacturing plants. The results show that ICT use among production workers is only positively related to higher coverage of involvement groups. On the other hand, AMT use is positively associated with the incidence of self-managed teams, job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and suggestion systems. We have found differences between ICT and AMT in the strength of association with new work practices for self-managed teams and suggestion systems.</p>

<p>Based on the existing research of cultural labour in the western academia, my research tends to explore the working life experiences of labour in Chinese <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> industries. The new forms of labour in the research are divided into three categories: professional labour, paid temporary labour, and free labour. On the one hand, the complex and ambivalent relationships between different categories of labourers are investigated; on the other hand, labourers’ working life experiences are illustrated via in-depth interviews.</p>
<p>Practically, this research focuses on workers in a large <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> company providing social networking services, Campus (anonymous). Workers in the research are explored via several aspects, such as working time and payment, working status, experience of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, as well as agency, referring to the negotiation and resistance between labour, company and the state. Theoretically, this research discusses the agency of labour which is largely ignored by the existing research, as well as seeks to contribute a bridge between the existing western research of cultural labour and Chinese new media labour.</p>

<p>Studies of stress and affiliation (3) suggest that workers who experience more stress in their jobs will exhibit greater affiliative behavior than workers who experience less stress. However, the former group of workers may show less desire for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and responsibility in their jobs, because under higher levels of stress greater job responsibility may be viewed more as a burden than a challenge (1). To test these hypotheses, 142 nursing staff of a hospital were administered Porter’s (2) perceived need satisfaction questionnaire followed by an intensive interview. Fourteen supervisors divided the total sample into three groups of nursing jobs, of low (n = 51). medium (n = 591, and high (n = 32) stress on the basis of severity of patients’ illness in the nursing units. The validity of this manipulation was ascertained by determining the perceived levels of stress in the three groups, using semantic differential type scales. The groups significantly differed from each other (F3.138 = 5.55, fi &lt; .05) with respea to perceived levels of job’scress. Analysis of variance of scores from the three groups representing satisfaction with six need categories (2) showed a significant interaction (F10.m = 4.84, p &lt; .05). Nurses belonging to the highly stressed group (dealing with terminal patients) showed a higher level of social need satisfaction than the group with low stress (t = 4.54, fi &lt; .05) working in outpatient clinics. Interview data suggested that higher social need satisfaction in the highly stressed group resulted from cohesive team work and greater social interaction among nursing staff on intensive care units. Their social relationships often went beyond the work place to parties and informal get-togethers where work problems and experiences were shared. Satisfaction wich <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and responsibility on the job showed similar trends. Highly stressed groups showed greater satisfaction wich their job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> than groups under low stress (t = 4.48, fi &lt; .05). Considering the fact that all three groups perceived similar levels of job responsibility and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in their jobs, the results suggest <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> the group under low stress wanted to have mote job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and responsibility than their jobs provided. The highly stressed group, on the other hand, did not want more <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> than was present in their jobs and therefore were more sltisfied with what they had. Interview data indicated that they preferred to share responsibility for decisions about patients with their peers or if possible defer these decisions to a higher authority. REFERENCES</p>

This study verified the content validity, construct validity,concurrent validity and convergent validity on 200 nurses working in general hospitals. The LRM tool was analyzedusing a total of 3 factors (ego, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, association) and 12 items. The reliability of this tool (Cronbach’s α) was 0.83 to 0.86. The tool showed a high level of reliability and validity. The difference from preceding studies showedthat the LRM is a measurement tool that considers multi-dimensional aspects, and it can provide the basic material of report management methods in diverse aspects for clinical nurse managers.

<p>Work overload or work pressure may undermine workers’ intrinsic motivation. In the present research, we tested the conditions under which this may (not) occur, including the perceived opportunity to blend on-site and off-site working through the effective use of computers and modern <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y. Our sample consisted of 657 workers (51% female) representing a variety of industries. As hypothesized, it is not high job demands per se, but high demands in combination with a high need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and a lack of perceived opportunities for blended working that undermines intrinsic work motivation. When workers high in need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> perceived opportunities for blended working, their intrinsic work motivation was not negatively affected by increasing job demands. This main finding suggests that, particularly for workers high in need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, the perceived opportunity for blended working is an effective, contemporary resource to cope with the increasing job demands typically observed in today’s workplace. Theoretically, these findings contribute to the refinement and extension of influential demands-resource models and Person-Job Fit theory. Practically, our findings may show managers how to effectively keep workers intrinsically motivated and productive in their jobs when job demands are high. We tested conditions under which high job demands may undermine work motivation.We examined the new concept of perceived opportunity for blended working.Blended working, enabled through ICTs, works when need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is high.High job demands per se do not undermine intrinsic work motivation.We emphasize the importance of fit between work context and workers’ needs.</p>

<p>Abstract <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Cyber</span>loafing – non-work related <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> use – is a prominent problem in modern firms. While incomplete contracts typically rule out direct control of workers’ effort, many employers hope to increase productivity through ‘soft’ control, by restricting the private use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> at work. In a lab experiment with real effort, we investigate how the temptation of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and a manager’s decision whether to restrict workers’ access to it affect the morale of workers. When tempted by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> access, workers reciprocate fair wages less than without access. Nevertheless, a manager’s decision to actively grant <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> access might increase workers’ effort: we find that highly reciprocal workers perceive the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> such a policy gives as a gift which they reciprocate with high effort despite the temptation of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>. For less reciprocal workers the temptation aspect dominates and restricting <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> access is better for the manager.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION Today, entrepreneurship is emphasized in all economies, as an important concept that is thought to contribute to the social and economical developments. The changing economic conditions not only increased the participation of women and men in labor force but also in entrepreneurial activity. The supporting activities of the national economies, providing incentives, increased need to change and diversity, developing technology, the easy access to information through the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> and social and individual factors increased the willingness of individuals to become an entrepreneur. In macro level, engaging in entrepreneurial activities contribute to the countries’ economies by providing employment opportunities for others, creating new businesses, generating new wealth and adding to national income and creating social change with innovative actions. In individual level, it also provides benefits such as individual <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, control and particularly financial freedom and freedom on adjusting work schedule. All these positive features are the one side of the coin, challenging work conditions, taken risks that are based on the motive of making profit and critical decisions in order to ensure the sustainability of business present the other side of coin. All these difficulties which are related with work life create a physical and psychological response that is called job stress. Today’s work life consists of rapidly changing technology, globalization and many economic crises that causes the individuals to perceive higher level of job stress than before. The relation between job stress and employee well-being and health has been the subject of many studies. Nurses, doctors, emergency workers, firefighters and policemen have formed the sample of the many studies on job stress due to stressful working conditions and job quality (Cevik, 2011; Goceri, 2014). The results revealed that job stress affects employees’ physical and mental health directly and negatively, and is positively related to their job dissatisfaction, burnout, absenteeism, loss of production and performance, and high turnover rates (Bolino &amp; Turnley, 2005; Flanagan, 2006; Kazmi, Amjad &amp; Khan, 2008; Rothmann, Jackson &amp; Krueger, 2003). Social support is the other important variable associated with the job stress. La Rocco, House &amp; French (1980), in their study on 636 male employees revealed that employees perceived social support from their colleagues and managers affect negatively their job stress. Blau (1981), reported that social support reduces the level of job stress and negative judgments of business through which individuals may have. Daniels and Guppy (1994), indicated that, in the light of data obtained from 244 accountants, social support decreases the job stress of accountants and have a positive impact on well-being of individuals. Despite the individual, social and economical advantages of entrepreneurship, it also considered as stressful and difficult work activities due to nature of business environment. Therefore, identification of the possible effect of social support on job stress of entrepreneurs provides necessary information about correctional entrepreneurs’ work environment and rendering support. The absence of empirical research about the association of social support and job stress, especially on entrepreneurs creates the incentives to do the present study. This study aims at assessing the effect of perceived social support on job stress for entrepreneurs in Australia. The examination of reducing factor of stress such as support would help to deal with stress’ costly negative outcomes that affect individuals and organizations alike. In addition, it intends to find out whether there is any difference between women and men entrepreneurs on perception of this effect or not by multi-group structural equation modeling. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK AND HYPOTHESIS Conservation of resource theory, which is a stress theory developed by Stevan Hobfoll (1989), examine the demands in the environment and the individuals’ resources to deal with these demands in order to identify stress process. …</p>

<p>Mikhail Piskunov – PhD student at St. Petersburg Institute of History, Russian Academy of Sciences, Russian Federation. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Email</span>: mpiskunov@eu.spb.ru This paper is devoted to the micropolitics of late-Soviet factory and employs the case of the Vyborg Pulp and Paper Factory in the mid‑1980s to shed light on the theoretical approaches of Alf Luedtke and Donald Filtzer, who adapted Harry Braverman’s labour process theory to soviet productive relationships. The failure of the Vyborg plant to meet plan targets led the upper management to follow Andropov-era policies in 1982–85 to raise labour discipline among workers. The upper management failed this task because of the passive resistance of plant line and shop floor managers. My main conclusion is what interfered with the objectives of the upper management most of all was the existence of a high level of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> between the key social-technological groups in the soviet enterprise. This elevated the role of low and middle level managers, and it was their intermediate position between workers and upper management that gave them such a strong influence. Sociologists such as Simon Clarke and Vladimir Yadov reached similar conclusions on the role of line and shop floor managers during research into the organization of labor within post-soviet factories during the market reforms of the 1990s. My research allows us to interpret this phenomenon as a consequence of specific Soviet productive relationships, which have not, in all likelihood, been fundamentally changed by Russia’s market reforms but even reinforced. Thus, the existence of forms of social inequality and power distribution within soviet industrial enterprises led to the distortion of Fordist (inspired by Taylor system) models of management, used by the Soviet authorities and the new industrial private owners alike. This explains the independent behavior of this group, a feature recognized by sociologists such as Simon Clarke in the 1990’s.</p>

<p>Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of this paper is to establish the relationship between psychological empowerment (PE) and four variables: <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, openness, superior-subordinate relationship (SSR), and climate of innovation (CI). The paper also aims to establish the mediating effects of SSR and CI on PE.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach</p>
<p>The sample size for the study was 319 employees (197 managers and 122 team leaders) from ten leading <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y companies of India. Structural equation modelling was used to test the model under study. Bootstrapping was applied to provide better estimation of the sample.</p>
<p>Findings</p>
<p>The exogenous variables under study were <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and openness. The mediating variables were SSR and CI. Results supported the model and indicated a significant direct effect between exogenous variables and PE. The role of SSR and CI as mediator was also ascertained.</p>
<p>Practical implications</p>
<p>The paper highlights that the managers of service organisations should take initiatives to provide a conducive climate for innovation. Having the right climate for innovation and support from superiors will make employees feel psychologically empowered.</p>
<p>Originality/value</p>
<p>Although as researchers and as practitioners the authors understand the importance of innovation climate and role of superior, few studies have sought to explain the mediating effects of SSR and CI.</p>

<p>In order to secure organizational sustainability in a rapidly changing environment, it is necessary to implement a decentralized and flexible work environment. In such work environments, normally individuals are provided with <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and independence in performing tasks, thus allowing them to further engage in their given work. This study investigated task antecedents of work engagement, and further explored the process of how task characteristics affect work engagement. It focused on examining the mediating effect of role ambiguity on the task characteristics-work engagement relationship and the moderating effect of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) presenteeism on the task characteristics–role ambiguity relationship through multiple regression analyses and a bootstrapping procedure on survey data collected from 202 South Korean employees. It found that task interdependence and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> were negatively associated with role ambiguity. Of the two task characteristics, only task interdependence had a negative relationship with role ambiguity, and this relationship was significantly moderated by ICT presenteeism such that the negative association between task interdependence and role ambiguity was more pronounced when ICT presenteeism was high than when it was low.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:lightgreen">Mobile Mess</span>enger Apps (MMAs) such as WhatsApp, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Facebook</span> Messenger, LINE, Signal or <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Snapchat</span> enjoy impressive success worldwide. Since many of these applications are offered at no monetary cost, telecommunications providers have argued that consumers choose MMAs predominantly to save money. In light of consumers’ complementary and multi-homing use of MMAs, it seems unlikely that saving money can fully explain their success. Our paper draws on more than 60 semi-structured qualitative interviews with consumers to explore why they opt for MMAs, why they use them complementary to Electronic Communications Services (ECS) and why they use multiple MMAs at a time. Specifically, our paper follows a grounded theory approach. It uses three rounds of interviews. The first round (20 interviews) established an initial understanding of relevant success factors of MMAs from a consumer perspective. The second round (24 interviews) focused on the role of technological seams enabling consumer to negotiate their social sphere. The third round of interviews (20 interviews) emphasized how functions not available with ECS may fulfill or thwart basic psychological needs (competence, relatedness and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>) as established in Self-Determination Theory (SDT). Throughout the three rounds of interviews, it emerges that indeed saving costs is not a central motive for consumer to use MMAs. Additional functions such as (1) rich interaction using video <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>, pictures, videos, etc.; (2) group <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>s; (3) awareness and notification functions; (4) voice messages; and (5) presentation of self e.g.&nbsp;via a profile picture provide better fulfillment of one’s basic psychological needs than ECS without these functions. Furthermore, our results show that both complementary use of ECS and MMAs as well as MMA multi-homing can be explained by consumers enacting competence in applying and decoding subtle social codes along the stages of stage models of relationship development. In sum, our results highlight the relevance of additional and innovative functionalities of MMAs for their success. These functionalities generally help to fulfill consumers’ basic psychological needs better than SMS. Furthermore, consumers’ need fulfillment is supported by the opportunity to use various MMAs in parallel to adhere to a finely grained set of social codes associated with interpersonal communication. Hence policy and regulators should not interfere with the innovation paths of these applications as well as the technological seams that exist between them. For marketers, our results add further insights as regards potential targeting strategies for developing platform business models for MMAs.</p>

<p>The purpose of this study was to identify the motivational factors that contribute to job satisfaction. Hinging upon Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg’s Two-Factor Theory, a case study of a descriptive and qualitative nature was carried out, which surveyed factors related to workplace satisfaction at the Federal University of Espirito Santo at Alegre campus. The data were obtained by means of a questionnaire sent via institutional <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> to the teaching and technical-administrative staff. 73 teachers and 45 technical-administrative staff members answered the questionnaire. The results allowed concluding that, in general, the servants are satisfied with: what they do, stability in the workplace, work environment, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the work sector, integration of the work team, salary plus benefits and opportunity for professional growth. The motivational factors were deemed as the main ones by the teachers whereas the hygienic factors were the most important for the administrative technicians.</p>

<p>Technology has blurred the line between work and non-work life. Communication and informational technologies like laptops, tablets, and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s enable workers to stay connected regardless of physical location and time of day (Kossek, 2016). Managing the boundaries between the work and home domain is not a new issue (Nippert-Eng, 2008), yet the increasing technological embeddedness in our everyday lives increases the complexity and relevance of these boundaries for both organizations and employees. Communication technology can in many cases give opportunities for more flexibility, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and control. Nevertheless, it might also exert a pressure on employees, breeding an “always available” culture in organizations (Kossek, 2016). Leaders and managers set examples through their own behavior, which signal what is expected from the employees. Leaders who reply to and send <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span>s during odd hours might contribute to the establishment of organizational norms that revolve around being available after hour and during off days.&nbsp; However, whether or not this becomes a problem is dependent on individual differences, perceived control over boundaries and companies’ availability policy. This review will take a closer look at the different factors that influence the management of work-life boundaries and how technology influences this relationship.</p>

<p>The impact of work-related <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use on organizational and private life is a&nbsp;current research topic in work and organizational psychology. In this study, we investigate the day-level effects of work-related <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use during non-work time on employees’ psychological well-being. Drawing on the Limited Strength Model of Self-Control, we propose that work-related <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use depletes limited regulatory resources and thus, impairs well-being at the day-level. Furthermore, based on arguments brought up by Self-Determination Theory, we propose basic need satisfaction at work as a&nbsp;buffering moderator of this relationship, arguing that for employees with high levels of basic need satisfaction work-related <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use is less depleting due to high intrinsic motivation and higher levels of energy, which support resource recovery. A&nbsp;diary study covering ten working days (N&nbsp;= 74) was conducted to test our hypotheses. Results indicate that, in line with our expectations, work-related <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use impairs employees’ psychological well-being at the day-level. The satisfaction of basic psychological needs at work (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence and relatedness) can buffer these effects and thus, protect employees from impairments of well-being. Practical relevance: Technological innovations such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s allow employees to work anywhere, at any time, thus blurring the lines between different life domains and endangering employees’ well-being. Our study suggests different practical interventions to prevent such impairments of well-being for both organizations and individuals.</p>

<p>User participation is increasingly being seen as a way to mitigate the challenges that firms face in innovation, such as high costs and uncertainty of customer acceptance of their innovations. Thus, firms are establishing online platforms to support users in innovating services, such as iOS and Android platforms for mobile data service (MDS) innovation. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Mobile phone</span> platforms are characterized by technology (toolkits) and policy (rules) components that could influence user’s innovation. Additionally, attributes of user innovators (lead userness) are expected to drive their innovation behavior. Yet it is unclear how these characteristics jointly impact users’ service innovation outcomes. To address this knowledge gap, we propose a model that builds on user innovation theory and the work design literature to explain the influences of lead userness, design <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, toolkit support, and their interactions on user’s innovation outcomes (innovation quantity) on these platforms. We conceptualize toolkit support in terms of two constructs (i.e., ease of effort and exploration), and design <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in terms of three constructs (i.e., decision-making <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, scheduling <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and work-method <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>). The model was tested using survey and archival data from two dominant <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> platforms (i.e., iOS and Android). As hypothesized, lead userness, exploration through toolkits, and ease of effort through toolkits positively affect users’ innovation quantity. Additionally, decision-making <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and work-method <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> influence innovation quantity, but scheduling <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> does not. Further, the proposed three-way interactions between lead userness, toolkit support, and design <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> constructs on users’ quantity of MDS innovation are largely supported. The findings enhance our understanding of user innovation on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> platforms.</p>

<p>Nonstandard work schedules have important consequences for workers in the new economy. Using unique data on the work times of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>-based freelancers, specifically, self-employed professionals participating in a Russian-language online labor market (N = 4,280), the authors find that working at night has adverse effects on workers’ subjective well-being as measured by satisfaction with work–life balance, life satisfaction, and emotional exhaustion. Night work has differential effects on freelancers’ well-being based on gender, partnership status, and caregiving responsibilities. Highlighting the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> paradox, the authors’ findings document how freelancers’ discretionary application of a flexible schedule to work at night consequently undermines their well-being.</p>

<p>This study investigates the impact of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICT) on worker <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and monitoring using the second wave of the German Linked Personnel Panel, a linked employer-employee data set. From a theoretical point of view, the impact of ICT on workplace organization is ambigu- ous. On the one hand, the fast diffusion of ICT among employees makes it possible to monitor professional activities, leading to greater centralization. On the other hand, ICT enable employees to work more autonomously, so that workplace organization becomes more decentralized. Based on ordinary least squares and instrumental variable estimates, we find that ICT promotes both centralization and decentralization tendencies. Furthermore, managerial employees are more affected by ICT-induced monitoring and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> than their non-managerial counterparts. Finally, the effect of digital ICT on employee <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> is more pronounced than the corresponding effect on employee monitoring. Again, this does especially hold for managerial employees. All in all, our results support the view that unlike prior technological revolutions digitalization primarily affects the employment prospects and working conditions of employees at medium and higher hierarchical levels.</p>

<p>A B S T R A C T Objective : The main goal of this article is to find the answer to the questions: what is the nature of the internationalization of family businesses from Poland? Do they internationalize ad hoc or do they plan an internationalization strategy? Which resources are needed for the internationalization process? Research&nbsp;Design&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Methods : The author used qualitative approach with CATI ( Computer Assisted Telephone Interview ), PAPI ( Paper &amp; Pen Personal Interview ) and CAII ( Computer Assisted <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> Interview ) methods. 420 questionnaires were used in the statistical analysis. Findings: This study focuses on the evaluation of entrepreneurship orientation as the main resource of the internationalization nature (ad hoc or a strategic plan) of family businesses from Poland and measured it through the four elements proposed by Covin and Slevin (1989): Innovation, Proactivity, <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> and Risk. Implications&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Recommendations:&nbsp; To internationalise, family business families need to apply entrepreneurship orientation, especially proactiveness towards new challenges, and strategic planning and tools. Contribution&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Value&nbsp;Added: &nbsp;The research provides evidence of a higher degree of EO in the behaviour of a family. More successful family businesses are in international markets. They also have a challenge oriented culture, which means that such companies are oriented towards new ventures, new relations, new solutions and new markets. But they plan new challenges using the strategic approach.</p>

<p>This paper aims to explore the relationship between job characteristics (JC) and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) moderated by job satisfaction (JS) among educators in the higher education institutions in the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Oman, taking into consideration that most educators at the higher education institutions in this area are expatriates.,A sample of 157 faculty members and instructors was used. Five job characteristics (skill variety, task identity, task significance, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and feedback) and five OCB behaviors (altruism, civic virtue, courtesy, conscientiousness, and sportsmanship) were studied. The overall job satisfaction was measured with seven general items adopted from Al-Damour and Awamleh (2002). Data were collected voluntarily using <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> network announcements and pencil and paper. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis was used in testing this moderation relationship.,Results showed that job satisfaction plays a significant moderating effect in enhancing the relationship between four out of the five job characteristics (feedback, skill variety, task identity and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>) and only two out of five OCB behaviors, namely, altruism and courtesy. Also, culture showed no significant impact on results.,Using a self-reporting tool, the respondents could give biased responses that might influence results. In addition, the use a complex relationship to establish a causality relationship among many variables measured with many items did make it difficult and sometimes errored out using SEM analysis.,This study delivers important suggestions to the management of these institutions as well as higher education administration about how to enhance their educators’ OCBs as a source of competitive advantage taking into consideration that expatriates work within certain legal and social contexts.,With very limited related research covering this region, this study provides an insight into how educators’ OCBs can be enhanced within unique employment structures and policies designed for expatriate educators in the GCC countries.</p>

<p>The purpose of this paper is to analyze the relationship between researchers’ <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> (SM) behavior and their academic performance.,A sample of 362 researchers was recruited from the colleges of management of 52 Chinese universities. A factor analysis of eight indices retrieved from the 362 data items was conducted. A total of 24 Chinese researchers were interviewed and given a robust test.,The results indicate that Chinese general <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> (GSM) is insufficient to support academic research and it is difficult for scholars to enhance the visibility of their academic performance using GSM platforms, which can actually induce addiction. University resources, management systems, and working environment affect how scholars apply SM.,The authors examined the researchers’ SM behavior by giving them a questionnaire and interview; however, this approach proved inadequate. The academic performance of researchers is affected by numerous factors, but the authors only considered SM behavior.,It is suggested that universities apply academic <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> (ASM) indicators to measure researchers’ contributions so that they self-regulate their SM usage attitudes. Also, universities should also promote ASM platforms.,This study analyzed scholars’ GSM usage and academic performance, and the moderating effect of university level on the relationship between need for competence and relatedness and need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. This comprehensive analysis contributes to the scholarly SM usage literature.</p>

<p>Recent developments in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y have led to renewed interest in the impact of flexible work on work-related outcomes such as job satisfaction, organizational identification and work engagement. Although there is a vast amount of literature indicating the positive association between job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and work-related outcomes, there has been little discussion about the contextual conditions that strengthen this relationship. This paper analyzes the role of perceived organizational alignment as a conditional factor and shows that <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> alone cannot explain an organization’s success in improving work-related outcomes. An analysis of online survey from 481 employees shows that the perceived organizational alignment moderates the positive effect of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> on work-related outcomes in the context of flexible work. For employees who perceive organizational alignment to be high, the positive relationships are strengthened for work engagement and organizational identification, but attenuated for job satisfaction. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.</p>

<p>Purpose There is an on-going debate about the role of workplace <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> leisure (WIL) and whether it is a vice or virtue. Considering this, the purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of WIL on workplace outcome variables such as employee satisfaction (ES) and employee productivity in the Malaysian context. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire that yielded 282 responses. Partial least square technique using SmartPLS-3 was used to test the study hypotheses. Findings Findings reveal that workplace WIL, workplace WIL policy and workplace <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> orientation (WAO) affect employees’ satisfaction. Additionally, the mediating role of ES was found to be significant. Practical implications The findings of this study are valuable for both managers and policy makers. These results can benefit the managers of conventional banks in Malaysia to decide how to enhance employees’ satisfaction and productivity by focusing on the key drivers such as WIL, workplace <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> leisure policy (WILP) and WAO. Originality/value This is a pioneering study which suggests that moderate use of WIL can have a positive and significant effect on workplace outcome variables. Moreover, this study theorised ES as a mediating variable; this helps to explain how organisations can transform workplace resources in term of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> leisure, WILP and WAO into high productivity by elevating employees’ satisfaction.</p>

<p>Abstract This article explores the institutional logics of intrapreneurial units, or groups within organizations that are designated to foster organizational innovation. Drawing on interviews with news intrapreneurs developing <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots in news media organizations, this study shows that innovation can be stymied because of conflicting institutional logics. News intrapreneurs adopt a logic of experimentation, audience orientation, and efficiency-seeking, but that approach clashes with a journalistic logic prioritizing news workflows, formats, and associated <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for newsworkers. These clashing logics limit the adoption and influence of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>bots. This study illustrates the shaping influence of competing institutional logics and their negotiation in the development, deployment, and success or failure of intrapreneurial activities within organizations. The lesson is not that the existence of competing logics is, by default, a defeating proposition for innovation. Rather, this study advances scholarly understanding of the role of institutional logics in frustrating or facilitating technological adoption in organizations.</p>

<p>This essay maps IBM’s attempts to construct a typology of high-tech ‘New Collar’ work and leverage policymaking outcomes to underwrite IBM corporate ventures capable of materializing this work. Through a discursive analysis of IBM corporate texts, webpages, and the 2017 New Collar Jobs Act, I argue for New Collar work to be understood through the lens of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, as IBM recasts notions of ‘autonomous’ technology onto humans by downplaying dystopic associations of technological <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and transferring notions of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to human workers. In doing so, I account for IBM’s use of ‘augmentation’ to situate human intelligence as the cognitive force uplifted by work performed with artificial intelligence. By pairing human augmentation with posthumanist conceptions of ‘distributed cognition’, IBM centers human intelligence through a redistributed cognition that reverses posthumanism’s decentering of human supremacy. Following from this, I unpack ‘New Collar’ as a reinvention of ‘white’ and ‘blue’ collar dichotomies and New Collar work as the grounds for tech workers to reinvent themselves. In this way, by minimizing the necessity of 4-year college degrees as pathways to economic and professional mobility, IBM constructs ‘New Collar’ with embedded notions of enlarged self-determination for applied worker intellect, vocational training, and employability. Under the aegis of creating, training, and employing New Collar workers, IBM pursues policy outcomes to underwrite corporate ventures related to New Collar work and bolster its institutional <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> amidst marketplaces of cognitive capitalism. By outlining how tax relief provisions of the New Collar Jobs Act correlate with neoliberal ideologies of legislators and IBM investments in public–private vocational models and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>security platforms, I account for IBM’s elongated ‘economy of learning’ that enables the company to more thoroughly capture, underwrite, and commodify New Collar cognition from training to market outputs.</p>

<p>The “Taylorian” management thinking of the outside control in the past has been unable to adapt to the current <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> era. The external control has changed to the flexible management of self-control, and the increase of job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> has become a trend. Job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> refers to the discretion of an organization to allow employees to complete tasks when, where, in what order and in what manner. In the past, the mainstream theoretical models and empirical studies have found that the job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> has a positive impact on employees. But currently the new research has found that the excessive job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> can have a negative impact on employees, and there is a “too-much-of-a-good-thing” effect. This article mainly expounds the “too-much-of-a-good-thing” effect of the job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and then, explains the effect by the two types mechanisms, “additive benefit and cost” and “interactive motivation and opportunity”. Finally, this article puts forward some issues that should be paid attention to future researches.</p>

<p>The paper investigates the relationship between job design and workrelated attitudes (job satisfaction and organisational commitment) in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>y (ICT) sector. We use data collected via an online questionnaire (using the Google Forms platform) from 97 employees working in the ICT sector in Serbia. The data was collected between February and June 2019. The analysis shows that job design is a predictor of both job satisfaction and organisational commitment. Of the five investigated job dimensions (Skill variety, Task identity, Task significance, <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span>, Feedback from job), ?<span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span>? was the most positively associated with job satisfaction (r=0.629) but was only moderately associated with organisational commitment (r=0.4). The other job dimensions were found to be weakly correlated with the investigated work attitudes, although the relationships were positive. Furthermore, the results indicate that work engagement mediates both investigated relationships, providing a deeper insight into how job design is translated into positive work-related attitudes. We discuss the possible managerial implications of the ?<span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span>? dimension and the interventions in work engagement required to positively influence work-related attitude formation and management in the ICT sector, and we distinguish between ?bottom-up? and ?top-down? interventions.</p>

<p>Abstract We investigate whether the returns to mobile <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) in the workplace are contingent on granting employees <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> over the structure of their workday through trust-based work time arrangements (TBW). Our regression analysis is based on a production function framework and exploits fine-grained firm survey data on ICT use and organisational practices for 1,045 service firms in Germany. We find empirical support for the argument that the returns to mobile ICT are higher when TBW allows for discretion over when, where and how to perform work-related tasks. The finding holds when we account for more limited forms of workplace flexibility, suggesting that the high degree of formal employee <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> under TBW drives the complementarity between mobile ICT and organisational practices.</p>

<p>In recent years, the role of technology in working life has increased. Technology and digitalization play a crucial role in the developmentof the organizations and the entire societies. The ascendance of digital organizations has also become a widely researched topic, the digital workplace environmentbeing an important organizational asset for increasing employee productivity (Köffer, 2015). Digitalization creates changes in the world of work, impacting not only business performance and worker productivity, but also job satisfaction, work/life balance, worker <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and monitoring across hierarchical levels. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies (ICT) in particular are essential components of working andimportant working tools (Korunka&amp;Vartiainen, 2017).</p>

<p>Purpose This study empirically verified employee engagement (EE) as an outcome of organizational communication and confirmed that the formation of EE is strengthened when <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use (SU) is at a higher level. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative approach was used in this research, whereby 408 valid samples were collected with an online survey. The hypotheses of direct effects were tested using the structural equation modeling (SEM) procedure, and the moderating effects were tested using the unconstrained product indicator method and the PROCESS macro. Findings The results showed that EE was significantly influenced by person–organizationvalue fit (POVF), transformational leadership (TFL) and job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (JA), and the effects of POVF and TFL were moderated significantly by SU. Although the influence of social support (SS) on EE was insignificant in the full model, SU moderated the effect of SS. The evidence also showed that work–family conflict (WFC) had no negative impact on EE. Research limitations/implications The participants of this study were restricted to a local area. Practical implications Organizations should develop job designs via two-way communication to bring up EE and SU can facilitate the process. Originality/value Previous research has identified EE as an outcome of organizational communication, but this concept has not yet been empirically verified. This research provides evidence to verify the above-mentioned concept and additionally confirms the moderating role of SU.</p>

<p>With globalization, digitalization, and the spread of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies, rules regulating work have been softened or completely abolished. As a consequence, employees face additional cognitive demands to plan, structure, and coordinate their work. In order to capture these demands of contemporary work, we constructed and validated the Cognitive Demands of Flexible Work (CODE) scale. The scale comprises four subscales (i.e., structuring of work tasks, planning of working times, planning of working places, and coordinating with others). We validated the scale in three independent samples (N = 1129) in both English and German. Confirmatory Factor Analyses supported the four-factor structure as well as the metric invariance of the different language versions. Moreover, the subscales showed convergent validity with related constructs such as requirements for problem solving or <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Criterion validity for emotional exhaustion, engagement, and problem-solving pondering suggests that cognitive demands of flexible work organizations can be construed as challenge stressors. However, relationships with emotional exhaustion only showed when <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> was controlled for. Overall, the CODE scale was shown to be a reliable and valid instrument to measure cognitive demands of flexibly organized work.</p>

<p>The growing gig economy has emerged as a significant theme of discussion in the world of work. Involving dynamic multi-party working arrangements between workers, digital platform organizations and requesters (i.e.&nbsp;customers), the gig economy is reshaping our understanding of the working relationship. Competing narratives around gig work explore the supposed <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> afforded to workers, the disruptive role of the algorithmic management function, and the challenges created by various legal ambiguities. This symposium aims to advance our understanding of this relatively novel phenomenon by examining key issues that exist in gig work and the most critical implications for HRM and employment relations scholarship. In addition to these perspectives, we explore several other contexts by sharing novel insights on the ramifications of gig working for information systems, conflict management, and legal debates. For organizations, our symposium examines the concept of algorithmic management in gig work, its role in implementing HRM activities, and its impact in shaping worker <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. For workers, we provide insights on how individuals may enact the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> provided to them by platforms, how workers may respond if expectations of flexibility are unmet, and the legal complexities arising from the fragmented nature of gig work. For requesters, we explore the novel role that customers hold in implementing HRM activities in gig work via rating mechanisms, and the subsequent implications for workers. Finally, our discussant will integrate the studies, draw theoretical and practical conclusions, and offer suggestions for advancing the topic.

<p>Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present the factors that form the innovation environment in the Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) sector, from a case study in a Brazilian multinational company operating in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Information and Communication Technolog</span>ies (ICT) and BPO segment. Design/methodology/approach Minnesota Innovation Research Program (MIRP) questionnaire was adopted, aimed to environment conducive to innovation. It was applied to a sample of employees, from different hierarchical levels, who participated in an innovation training program developed and implemented by the organization. The data were analyzed to verify, in a simplified initial diagnosis, the influence of internal and external factors defined by MIRP in the company’s innovation process. Findings Innovation management process focuses predominantly on processes (71.4% of occurrences). As impact of the factors: results (88.9%), <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (76.3%), leadership (74.9%), resources (74.6%), internal relationship of the innovation group (73.1%), formalization (68.4%), processes (64.5%), relationship effectiveness (63.7%), external relationship of the innovation group (63.2%) and dependence on external resources (52.6%). There was confirmation that the innovation program of company is effective and that the culture of innovation is institutionalized. Research limitations/implications A crossing of supplementary information could reveal some significant difference in the perception of the innovative culture and performance of the innovation processes between distinguished profiles. Practical implications Better guidance for management of ICT/BPO companies in an Open Innovation paradigm. Social implications Better relationship among the actors of an Open Innovation industry arrangement. Originality/value Improvement of the innovation process can occur through a greater focus on Open Innovation.</p>

<p>Amid growing precarity and zero hour contracts, the ‘gig economy’ represents a new way of working mediated by web technology. Workers can sign up to a work platform – a website or <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> program that manages the work automatically – and take on work at the tap of a button. Some platforms manage labour, such as driving for Uber or delivering food for Deliveroo, while others manage retail activity, such as Ebay or Etsy.&lt;br/&gt; Recent research has shown that a significant number of people are using platform work to earn money, with over half being young people aged 16-34. While there are some data regarding satisfaction levels and attractors, there is little research examining specific age segments of workers, or the relationship between platform work and career.&lt;br/&gt; Using data from focus group interviews with school and Further Education college students, this paper will discuss findings from research investigating how young people in England aged 16-19 perceive the gig economy and whether they feel that it will be relevant to their careers, with a view to discussing whether it may be necessary to include in careers education programmes or guidance.&lt;br/&gt; The interview data indicate that these participants were occasionally using platforms to make money, and a few were earning regularly, usually on retail platforms. While some interviewees appreciated the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and flexibility promised by gig economy work, the uncertainty, perceived low status, and lack of career progression prevented them from taking it seriously as a career option. Instead, they preferred traditional forms of work that provide more stability and organisational support - an increasingly rare commodity in a labour market that is changing rapidly in the opposite direction. We conclude that while there may be little value in giving detailed individual guidance on the gig economy, it could be valuable to use it as a way of teaching young people about the labour market and different types of employment</p>

<p>This study extends our understanding of humble leadership as an important trust-engendering leadership style that influences employee behaviors. Drawing on social exchange theory, we articulate how humble leaders’ employee-centric behaviors signal trust and facilitate a social exchange relationship between leaders and followers. Specifically, we posit that a leader’s humble leadership behaviors are positively related to employees’ task performance and organizational citizenship behavior via feelings of being trusted by one’s supervisor. We also predict that the interaction between humble leadership and employee job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> will influence employees’ appraisal of feeling trusted. We tested our moderated-mediation model using experimental vignette data and three-wave survey data collected from 233 employees and their supervisors working at a large Chinese <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> company. Study results support our hypotheses that humble leadership, and its interaction with employee job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, contribute to feeling trusted by their supervisor. Furthermore, we found that humble leadership behavior, via enhanced perceptions of feeling trusted, predicted supervisor-rated employee task performance and organizational citizenship behavior toward the organization. The implications for theory and practice are discussed.</p>

<p>Purpose This study aims to explore the impact of ethical leadership on employee creative deviance, with job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> as a mediator and creative self-efficacy as a moderator between job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and creative deviance. Design/methodology/approach A survey was developed based on construct measures from the literature. A total of 316 responses were received from employees of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y companies located in China’s Pearl River Delta. Findings Both ethical leadership and job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> have a positive impact on employee creative deviance; job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> plays a mediating role between ethical leadership and creative deviance; creative self-efficacy does not have a significant moderating effect on the job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-creative deviance relationship. Research limitations/implications Future studies could explore the potential moderating role of both job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and creative-self efficacy in the link between ethical leadership and creative deviance. Practical implications This study recommends that organizations should adopt and promote an ethical leadership approach to manage creative deviance at work. Organizations could explore alternative methods of task completion to support the job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for the employees to mitigate the dilemmas associated with creative deviance. Originality/value This is one of few studies that examine the impact of ethical leadership on employee’s creative deviance, despite the fact that the influence of ethical leadership on the followers has been extensively examined.</p>

<p>Purpose Although a supportive workplace is increasingly considered important for employees’ performance, much of the evidence remains speculative, for example, it lacks offsetting mechanisms. This study addresses circumstances when perceived support helps and when it hurts work performance, depending on the mediating effects of job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, intrinsic motivation and job satisfaction under the boundary conditions of perceived helpfulness of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms and felt stress. Design/methodology/approach This study collected data using a questionnaire protocol that was adapted and refined from the original scales in existing studies. The sample consists of 900 employees from the public healthcare industry in Vietnam. To test the hypotheses, the partial least squares (PLS) technique was used. Findings This study finds that job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, intrinsic motivation and job satisfaction are important for the perceived support and work performance relationship in which perceived helpfulness of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms plays a critical confounding role. The findings also confirm that felt stress negatively moderates the relationship between job satisfaction and work performance, weakening the effect job satisfaction has on employee work performance. Originality/value This study specifies the boundary conditions under which work performance is mostly affected while enhancing the understanding of how to reinforce intrinsic motivation and job satisfaction. The findings offer organizational and human resource management (HRM) scholars and practitioners a closer look at perceived helpfulness of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms and support the suggestions that <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>-supportive workplaces are superior.</p>

<p>In the industrial system, the organization of labor had to be carried out exactly according to the regulations and instructions written by the designer of the work. In the postindustrial economy, the ideology of labor organization is changing. At the dawn of postindustrialization, such concepts as «decent work», «humanization of labor», «rotation of work», «development of human resources», «enrichment of labor», etc. are widely used. At the same time, the trends of «professionalization of labor» and its <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> began to appear. Step by step, the multi-disciplinary nature of labor grew, when from the post-operative Taylorist-Ford organization of labor began to move to a multi-operational, based on the combination of functions and professions. The emphasis is on creating holistic models of attractive decent work, reducing the distance between different categories of employees, primarily managers and workers. Unlike in the past, prevention, repair and reprogramming of equipment is assigned to the main staff. This indicates a flexible organization of not only production, but also labor. Thus, the employee is freed from the «dictates of machines» and bureaucratic instruction, and is given the freedom to choose decisions and actions while increasing responsibility and risk for the successful performance of work. It becomes the main link in the technological process. When creating new jobs, it is also necessary to take into account the fact that the employee entering the labor market is changing today. The quality of the labor force is improving: the employee’s educational level and competence are growing, and the process of development and training becomes continuous throughout life. The professional space of the employee is also developing, which is manifested in the emergence of new, sometimes hybrid professions related to receiving, transmitting, and processing information in its various forms and ensuring the sustainable development of the information environment. There is a transformation of the place and role of the employee in social production. These changes allow us to speak about the formation of a new type of employee, characterized by a high educational level, knowledge of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICT), having the skills to work with complex intellectual equipment, independent and creative thinking, activity and responsibility in their actions, high ability to self-organization, based on creativity in work, that is, the employee becomes creative. The new nature of work, manifests itself, on one side of individualization, it characterizes the weakening of relations of the employee with a certain social environment (workers become more mobile and less dependent on the firms in which they work), the conclusion of individual labour agreements, the personification of the system of motivation of personnel, and on the other – to increase the creative content of the work and turning it into a means of human self-realization. In this regard, the nature of employee management changes, since it becomes not only the object of management, but also its subject – an individual developing within a certain cultural tradition. Talent management, in contrast to HR processes, through which the operational management of personnel is carried out, focuses special attention on employees as the most important single asset that has a strategic focus. The article discusses the search for talented employees in the organization, highlights the characteristic features of modern approaches to managing them (employees), and in particular, the tools for this work, which are constantly being improved.</p>

<p>This article analyzes the extent to which, under federal law, employers may legally monitor employee telephone and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> communications that take place on company equipment. Employers may desire to monitor (intercept, record and listen to) employee telephone conversations and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> communications, in the ordinary course of business in order to evaluate employee performance or customer satisfaction, or document transactions between employees and vendors, or to meet security, efficiency or other needs. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Email</span> is now the default mode of communication in the workplace, and while employers note its efficacy, employees typically have a different view of employer monitoring, and this article discusses how courts reconcile the competing interests of employers in business performance, with employees’ desire for privacy and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.</p>

<p>‘Work-life balance’ (‘WLB’) emerged as the catchcry of workers everywhere in&nbsp;the late 20th century. It was particularly appealing to women lawyers as it was&nbsp;thought that if a balance could be effected between work and life, satisfying&nbsp;careers and the raising of children could be combined. The key to effecting this&nbsp;balance, it was believed, was flexible work. Technology has facilitated this&nbsp;flexibility as all that is required is a computer, or other device with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>&nbsp;connection, and a <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>. Provided that the firm is agreeable, the lawyer&nbsp;would have a degree of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in determining when and where the work is&nbsp;carried out. However, flexible work has not always proved to be the boon that it&nbsp;was hoped, as the shift from face-to-face time to virtual time has blurred the&nbsp;boundary between work and life, insidiously extending the hours of work and&nbsp;impinging on the realm of intimacy. Drawing on a web-based survey and&nbsp;interviews with lawyers Australia-wide, this article considers the ramifications&nbsp;of perpetual connectivity for lawyers in private practice, with particular regard&nbsp;to its gender significance.

<p>The paper shows how and why Home-Based <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> Businesses are drivers of variety. This paper argues, by means of five theoretical perspectives, that because of the variety HBIBs generate, they contribute to the economy over and above their direct and indirect contributions in terms of revenue and employment. A multiple case study approach is employed studying the best practices of eight HBIBs. It is found that HBIBs generate variety because of the unique way in which they operate, and because of the reasons why they are started. How HBIBs operate can be captured in the acronym SMILES: Speed, Multiple income, Inexpensive, LEan, and Smart. They are founded (amongst other motives) for reasons of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, freedom and independence. Both aspects - the how and why - of HBIBs are conducive to the creation of variety as they facilitate trial-and-error commercialization of authentic ideas. Five theoretical perspectives posit that variety is important for the industry and the economy: evolutionary theory, strategic management, organic urban planning, opportunity recognition, and the knowledge economy. The findings are discussed in the context of each perspective.</p>

<p>Firms increasingly seek to use <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>ies as sources of ideas, innovations, and designs. However, many such open innovation efforts lack sustained participation and ultimately fail. This research sought to understand motivations to participate in a firm-hosted design community and how the nature of the design task influences sustained participation. From an inductive study of a leading vehicle design community, we found project variety—across two dimensions of project <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and project complexity—supported a range of motivations to participate and the social practice of vehicle design. We discuss implications of our study for research on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>ies and for firms within the global vehicle industry.</p>

<p>Guided by theories of “management by exception,” we study the impact of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y on worker and plant manager <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and span of control. The theory suggests that information technology is a decentralizing force, whereas communication technology is a centralizing force. Using a new data set of American and European manufacturing firms, we find indeed that better information technologies (enterprise resource planning (ERP) for plant managers and computer-assisted design/computer-assisted manufacturing for production workers) are associated with more <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and a wider span of control, whereas technologies that improve communication (like data intranets) decrease <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for workers and plant managers. Using instrumental variables (distance from ERP’s place of origin and heterogeneous telecommunication costs arising from regulation) strengthens our results.

<p>Making research and publishing these researches at academic journals is accepted as a differential feature in the academic world. Previous studies Show the evidence that work engagement is a significant predictor of performance. In this study, the relationship between work engagement, which is assumed as substitute for performance, and job resources is examined. At least one university from each city of Turkey is selected and academicians of those universities are sent 20- items survey via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>. 422 academicians is reached by using convenience sampling method. Job resources are subject to second order confirmatory factor analysis. Further, both for job resources and work engagement discriminant validity, convergent validity and composite reliability test are implemented. The results are analyzed with structural equation modelling. The results indicate that, job resources (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, social support, coaching, opportunity for personal development and task significant) need to be enhanced in order to develop work engagement of Turkish academicians.</p>

<p>With globalization, digitalization, and the spread of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies, rules regulating work have been softened or completely abolished. Consequently, employees face additional cognitive demands to plan, structure, and coordinate their work. To capture these demands of contemporary work, we constructed and initially validated the Cognitive Demands of Flexible Work (CODE) scale. The scale comprises four subscales (i.e., structuring of work tasks, planning of working times, planning of working places, and coordinating with others). We initially validated the scale in three independent studies (overall N = 1,129) in German and English. Confirmatory factor analyses supported the four-factor structure, as well as scalar invariance, of the different language versions. Moreover, the subscales showed convergent and divergent validity with related constructs such as requirements for problem solving or <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. The criterion validity for emotional exhaustion, engagement, positive work rumination, negative work rumination, and problem-solving pondering suggested that cognitive demands of flexible work can be construed as challenge demands. However, relationships with emotional exhaustion were not significant. Overall, the CODE scale was shown to be a reliable and valid instrument to measure cognitive demands of flexible work.</p>

<p>The role of the traditional labour market has been changed by globalisation and modern technology, particularly by the unprecedented and generalised use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s. The platform economy, also called “gig economy” is radically changing the rights and duties of service providers, as it is associated with a high degree of flexibility and profit maximisation, which suppresses or significantly limits traditional workers’ rights, such as the right to paid holiday, maternity license or unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>This paper focuses on Uber, the current international market leader on online ridesourcing platforms, and the impact they have on gig workers that chose to enter the platform. Online ridesourcing platforms assign private drivers to rides booked and paid for by passengers through an app. The platform’s drivers may vary from ‘genuine’ freelance business owners, ‘multiple jobholders’, “moonlight” workers to workers who opted for working full-time as gig workers.</p>
<p>Among the latter are former professional riders or amateur riders who were unable to cope with the tight restrictions of a heavily regulated professional passenger transportation sector, high-priced licenses, inefficient work-life balance policies and lack of safety guarantees. A sector of the scholarship argues that the conditions offered by platforms to drivers encourage entrepreneurship across all segments of society and foster the decentralization of economic growth. In fact, on-demand ridesharing platforms adapt the drivers’ income to the market, providing for primetime pricing to meet increased demand. Additionally, by allowing for a flexible work schedule, they are deemed to promote work-life balance. Finally, by integrating technology they ensure a more efficient provision of services and a safer one as well, with passenger registration, money-free rides and GPS location as integral part of the operation. The wider majority of the scholarship, however, has been heavily criticizing these platform services for infringing workers’ rights.</p>
<p>If there is an almost consensus in the scholarship that gig workers have been opting for entering a labour economy which will affect them, their families and other parts of the working population in the mid or long-run, the question is asked whether it is justified for regulators to nudge such workers into taking decisions (or imposing these upon them) which are better for their own welfare and the decent living standard of other workers. In other words, what should be the balance between respecting the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of ‘gig-workers’ in grasping their chances to access the ‘gig-labour market’ and taking paternalizing measures to protect ‘gig-workers’ against ‘self-exploitation’?</p>

<p>Wellbeing refers to employees’ physical and emotional satisfaction arising from the work environment and the work itself. Ideally, employee wellbeing ought to enhance workers engagement. Workers engagement possibly relate to some factors including leadership. Evidence exist that work enrichment is required among the employee studied while work environment in terms of work condition, corporate culture, and positive relationship with colleagues as well as work itself influence job satisfaction and leads to employee engagement. were related to job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and feedback. Employee with large amount of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> may willingly invest efforts and persist in the face of obstacles which are strong indicator of engagement. Also, high performing leadership finds intolerable bulling, but promotes job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, performance management, and employee assistance programmes and the institutions cannot boast of one. Various recommendations including the institution promotion and encouragement of employee assistance programme were given.

<p>The purpose of this study is to explore the mechanism and boundary condition of the relationship between enterprise <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use and job performance. This study used a two-wave design, with a final sample of 481 employees from an automobile company. The results indicate that enterprise <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use is positively related to both work overload and informational support. Work overload and informational support predicts job performance negatively and positively, respectively. Furthermore, work overload and informational support mediates the relationship between enterprise <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use and job performance. Job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> moderates the relationship between enterprise <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use and work overload and informational support. Therefore, this study provides a more balanced view of how enterprise <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use influences job performance by demonstrating the opposing mediating roles of work overload and informational support. Furthermore, this study fills the gap by taking job characteristics into more consideration when examining the boundary condition of enterprise <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use. Last, this study validates the generalization of job demands-resources model in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> research.</p>

<p>Organizations must adapt to the trend of digitalization. Nowadays, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> engagement editors play an increasingly crucial role for organizational growth and prosperity in the digital age. Engagement editors are usually tasked to perform the functions of marketing, content production, and data analysis. They have to manage <span style="background-color:lightgreen">online communit</span>ies on behalf of the organization, and encounter online audiences’ frequent toxic and aggressive behaviors. Engagement editors thus are prone to emotional stress. Substantial literature has examined the influence of leadership style on employee performance. However, passive leadership is rarely studied. This research investigates (1) whether passive leadership would negatively affect engagement editors’ performance (i.e., online interaction with audiences); and (2) how the negativity would be ameliorated by certain organizational policies (i.e., job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>) and their individual attributes (i.e., employee resilience) from the conservation of resource perspective. We surveyed 122 engagement editors and used the smartPLS 3.2.9 to analyze the data. This research provides important theoretical and practical implications.</p>

<p>Abstract Almost every aspect of a person’s daily life is affected by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICTs), and some unfavorable outcomes such as technostress have been noticed. In this study, we examine how technostress affects knowledge hiding. Drawing from the energy-consuming characteristic of technostress and prior research on how technostress affects ICT users, this article builds and tests a model that takes work exhaustion as a mediator and explores the moderating role of job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. To test our conceptual model, we examined the responses to a survey questionnaire submitted by 287 ICT users from multiple organizations. Using structural equation modeling, we found that technostress increases employees’ knowledge hiding behavior, and work exhaustion partially mediates technostress and knowledge hiding, while job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> only moderates the relationship between technostress and work exhaustion when the fourth factor of technostress, viz., techno-insecurity, is excluded. We also discuss future research directions and implications of the results.</p>

<p>Nurses are assigned a key role in pandemic response, with work engagement considered to be pivotal. The job demands-resources theory assumes that work engagement depends on job resources and job demands. Key job resources and demands have already been proposed for nurses. However, there is no evidence on their importance under pandemic conditions. Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate their relevance to nurses’ work engagement during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.The study was carried out in a cross-sectional design and addressed nurses in direct health care settings in Germany. Data was collected administering a quantitative online survey using valid and reliable measures during the second wave of the pandemic. A convenience sample was obtained, including the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, randomly selected health care facilities, and all universities with nursing-related programs in Germany. The dataset for analyses comprised a total of 1,027 cases. The sample included nurses of various educational levels and from different sectors. Multiple linear regression analysis after multiple imputation was used to examine the relevance of key resources and demands for work engagement.Key resources and demands explained 36% of the variance in nurses’ work engagement during the COVID-19 pandemic. Positive associations were found between the key resources of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (β¯SP=0.072, 95% CI [0.011; 0.133]), professional resources (β¯SP=0.204, 95% CI [0.124; 0.285]), and interpersonal relationships (β¯SP=0.178, 95% CI [0.117; 0.240]) and nurses’ work engagement. On the demands side, lack of formal rewards negatively (β¯SP=-0.312, 95% CI [-0.380; -0.245]) affected work engagement, whereas work overload (β¯SP=0.063, 95% CI [0.001; 0.126]) was positively associated with work engagement.The job demands-resources theory is suitable for explaining nurses’ work engagement even in times of crisis. Taken together, key resources and demands have a significant influence on nurses’ work engagement under pandemic conditions. However, not all so-called key resources and demands actually have a key status in a pandemic.Any lack of formal rewards should be countered, professional resources should be sustainably secured, and the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of nurses and their interpersonal relationships should be strengthened. Nursing management decisions should be made not only with the current pandemic but also the post-pandemic period in mind.</p>

However, not all so-called key resources and demands actually have a key status in a pandemic.Any lack of formal rewards should be countered, professional resources should be sustainably secured, and the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of nurses and their interpersonal relationships should be strengthened. Nursing management decisions should be made not only with the current pandemic but also the post-pandemic period in mind.</p>

<p>An understanding of the overall relationship between the work-related use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) and employees’ well-being is lacking as the rising number of studies has produced mixed results. We meta-analytically synthesize and integrate existing literature on the consequences of ICT use based on the job demands-resources model. By using meta-analytical structural equation modeling based on 63 independent studies ( N = 26,295), we shed light on the relationship between ICT use and employees’ well-being (operationalized as burnout and engagement) in a model that incorporates the mediating role of ICT-related resources and demands. Results show that ICT use is opposingly related to burnout and engagement through <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, availability, and work-life conflict. Our study brings clarity into the contradictory results and highlights the importance of a simultaneous consideration of both positive and negative effects for a comprehensive understanding of the relationship. We further show that the time of use and managerial position, and methodological moderators can clarify heterogeneity in previous results.</p>

<p>Purpose Previous studies overemphasize the negative effects of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> usage (SMU) within organizations and underestimate its positive influences on employees’ behavior. This study attempts to link employees’ <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> use at work to their creativity performance. Design/methodology/approach Based on the bounded generalized reciprocity theory and unbounded indirect reciprocity (UIR) theory, the authors developed a research model. To test the model, the authors collected a set of 172 paired data of organizations and employees from 31 knowledge-intensive enterprises in China to test the hypothesis. Findings This research found that the social, cognitive and hedonic uses of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> all directly affect employee creativity. Relational energy fully mediates the effects of the cognitive and hedonic usages on creativity. Moreover, job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> moderates the effects of the relationships among the social, cognitive and hedonic uses on employee creativity. Originality/value The conclusions not only enriched authors’ understanding of the effectiveness of interpersonal interaction but also extended the research boundary of the relationship between SMU and employee creativity.</p>

<p>Job and career satisfaction of early-career pharmacists and pharmaceutical scientists is imperative to ensure a motivated and effective workforce, and a secure future for pharmacy practice. In turn, this enables planning, deployment and long term implementation of global imperatives, through universal pharmacy coverage. This study used data from a global survey to determine the level of job and career satisfaction and identify factors that are most significant in determining satisfaction in early-career professionals. A cross-sectional survey was distributed to members of the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) Young Pharmacists Group (YPG) via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">email</span> and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms from November 2019 to May 2020. A previously validated questionnaire using 5-point Likert scales was used. Data were analysed by exploratory factor analysis, using principal component analysis, oblique rotation, and reliability testing of identified components, followed by a comparative statistical analysis. A total of 1014 respondents from 92 countries participated in this study. Regions of domicile significantly affected job satisfaction ( p = 0.004) and career satisfaction ( p &lt; 0.0001) scores. Pharmacists working in community pharmacies perceived lower job satisfaction measures compared to those who work in academic institutions ( p &lt; 0.0001) and industry sector ( p = 0.012). There is a negative association between career expectations and job satisfaction and career satisfaction scores. The workplace climate is related to education and training opportunities, lower reported workloads, greater <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and more remuneration. This was an international study of early-career pharmacists and pharmaceutical scientists. Enhancing factors associated with job and career satisfaction is essential to support early-career pharmacists and pharmaceutical scientists in obtaining fulfilment and esteem in their chosen careers. Developing and implementing a well-framed system that provides a conducive working environment, remuneration, and greater <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> could improve job and career satisfaction. This study provides evidence to support investment in early-career training, stated in the FIP Development Goal 2.</p>

<p>Almost every aspect of a person’s daily life is impacted by <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICTs), and some unfavorable outcomes like technostress have been noticed. In this study, we examine how technostress affects knowledge hiding. Drawing from the energy-consuming characteristic of technostress and prior research on how technostress affects ICT users, this article builds and tests a model that takes work exhaustion as a mediator and explored the moderating role of job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. To test our conceptual model, we examined the responses to a survey questionnaire submitted by 287 ICT users from multiple organizations. Using structural equation modeling, we found that technostress increases employees’ knowledge hiding behavior, and work exhaustion partially mediates technostress and knowledge hiding, while job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> only moderates the relationship between technostress and work exhaustion when the fourth factor of technological stress, techno-insecurity, is excluded. We also discuss future research directions and implications of the results.</p>

<p>This study draws upon organizational psychology and platform labor research to investigate how socio-psychological factors affect the mental well-being of platform workers and help them cope with the challenges of work. Based on a survey study of 500 food-delivery workers (‘riders’) in China, we provide quantitative evidence of workers’ ambivalent subjective experiences that complements the predominantly qualitative account in the extant literature. In particular, we assess the complex relationships between meaningfulness of work, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> at work, self-perceived competence, and workers’ subjective well-being. Our data also show that the stress-buffering effect of social support mainly comes from the riders’ familial contact and their online group <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span> with other workers. Overall, despite the well-documented precarity and stress in platform work, the riders in our sample appear to be able to mobilize inner and relational resources to achieve a relatively high-level mental well-being.</p>

<p>There is a shortage of registered nurses (RNs) who work in the specialty of Psychiatric-Mental Health (PMH). Attrition among Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurses (PMHNs) may be related to a lack of leadership empowerment which includes <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and access to professional development opportunities. The purposes of this study, guided by Kanter’s theory of structural empowerment, were to determine (a) if there was a relationship between leadership empowerment behavior and PMH RNs’ intent to leave within the first 2 years of practice in inpatient psychiatric settings and (b) if there was a relationship between leadership empowerment behavior and intent to leave among this population who are in their first 2 years of practice, based on RN demographics. The key variables were measured with the Leader Empowering Behavior Questionnaire and the Turnover Intention Scale. The study participants included 111 psychiatric RNs in their first 2 years of practice who were recruited via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>. Results showed an inverse relationship between leadership empowerment behavior and intent to leave. The RN demographic characteristics did not affect this relationship. The study findings could be used for social change by creating awareness for PMHN leaders to develop empowerment behavior as a strategy to mitigate new PMH RN turnover so that they can stay in practice and positively impact therapeutic and quality patient care delivery. Future studies using mixed methods and a larger sample size would be helpful to obtain an in-depth understanding of the role of leadership empowerment behavior and retention from the RN’s perspective.</p>

<p>This paper examines the innovation strategy of Siemens, a key player in Europe’s digital economy, by performing network and lexical analyses using data derived from Siemens’s patents and scientific publications since 1998. We observe that the company’s innovation efforts evolved from a broader attempt to develop internal <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) capabilities – alongside its historical industrial priorities – to a strategy focused on developing artificial intelligence (AI) for sector-specific and niche applications (such as life and medical sciences). As a result, it became dependent on tech giants’ clouds for accessing more general AI services and digital infrastructure. We build on the intellectual monopoly literature focusing on the effects of tech giants on other leading corporations, to analyse Siemens’s experience. By abandoning the development of general ICT and given the emergence of tech giants as digital economy intellectual monopolies, we show that Siemens is risking its technological <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> towards these big tech companies. Our results provide clues to understand the challenges faced by Europe and its firms in relation to US and Chinese tech giants.</p>

<p>Purpose Though employees are important stakeholders of a brand, their role in building brand equity has long been neglected. This study aims to deepen the understanding of employees’ brand co-creation efforts and their contribution to employee-based brand equity (EBBE). Design/methodology/approach The study analyses implicit and explicit communication activities by employees on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> network LinkedIn and quantifies the contribution of their posts to EBBE. Data has been gathered from more than 1,300 posts and 130 private accounts, representing different employee groups of five corporate brands. Findings The investigation illustrates the high importance of brand co-creation in social networks by employees and helps practitioners to better understand the underlying processes. Research limitations/implications Case-study research has limitations of generalisability. However, the authors unveil important limits to exploiting the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of employees’ word-of-mouth communication. Practical implications Under a co-creative perspective, every <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> activity of an employee can be a positive contribution to a brand’s equity. Therefore, companies should closely monitor EBBE. Originality/value The authors draw on basic conceptual insights and empirical work by other researchers but extend and interpret them in a new context. The study provides initial indications of key antecedents of and barriers to successful management of employees’ brand co-creation activities.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic led to an abrupt change from in-person to online teaching in higher education, resulting in increased use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) and students’ stress and uncertainty. Integrating theories of human motivation, stress, and humane work design, we investigated whether different types of action regulation hindrances (ARH) pertaining to human (ICT competence deficits), technology (technical problems), interaction (coordination difficulties), and task aspects (work overload) related to technostress (H1). Furthermore, we examined if this relationship was mediated by satisfaction of the basic human needs for competence, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and relatedness (H2). Our analysis of causes and mechanisms of technostress is based on cross-sectional survey data (self-report) from 205 psychology students attending an organizational psychology class that was switched from an in-person to an online format due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Structural equation modeling revealed that different types of ARH (i.e., ICT competence deficits, technical problems, coordination difficulties, work overload) positively predicted technostress (β = .17 to β = .42, p &lt; .05). The effects were (partially) mediated by satisfaction of the need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> (β = .11 to β = .15, p &lt; .05), for all ARH except technical problems (β = .01, p = .86). We discuss implications for online course planning, technostress prevention as well as potential interventions beyond pandemic times.</p>

<p>Purpose Personally owned mobile <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (MICT) have been widely and routinely used for work purposes in the post-pandemic workplace. Drawing on adaptive structuration theory for individuals (ASTI), this study investigates the antecedents (i.e.&nbsp;characteristics of MICT) and outcomes (i.e.&nbsp;employee affective and cognitive well-being) of routine MICT use in the remote work context. Design/methodology/approach The research model was empirically tested via a survey of 430 working professionals who use personal MICT for work purposes in the remote work context. Findings Results show that the routine MICT use increases employee affective well-being (i.e.&nbsp;job satisfaction) and mitigates cognitive well-being (i.e.&nbsp;technology overload). The mediation effects of routine MICT use on the relationships between its characteristics (<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and timeliness) and employee well-being (i.e.&nbsp;job satisfaction and technology overload) were also found. Originality/value Existing research on remote work has widely focused on employee productivity and performance, while attention has rarely been paid to the effects of the technology-driven “new normal” on employee well-being. Grounded in ASTI, this study identifies three MICT characteristics as sources of user adaptive structuration, which impact employees’ routine MICT use behavior and further influence employee affective and cognitive well-being. This research can help understand employees’ personal MICT use adaptive behavior and improve their well-being.</p>

<p>The employment psychology of young migrant workers in China has changed drastically in past decades. In particular, the construction industry has been facing labor shortages and aging workforces for years, and the eruption of coronavirus disease 2019 has exacerbated the problem. In contrast, the food delivery business has grown rapidly during the pandemic with a surge in the number of food delivery knights. It is vitally important to understand the employment psychology of the young migrant workers, the main component of the workforce for both industries. The presented study conducted a comparative analysis between construction workers and food delivery knights using data from face-to-face interviews, online <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, and World Value Survey. Results showed that the two groups of young migrant workers have different employment psychology during their job selection, construction workers cared more about income, and food delivery knights paid more attention to <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, working environment, and family.</p>

<p>The purpose of this article is to extend knowledge and understanding of work in the platform economy by focusing on the phenomenon of (video)blogging on and around <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> platforms. The growth of the platform economy has attracted considerable attention in recent years. As yet, however, research has focused almost exclusively on labour platforms that operate to match the supply of and demand for paid work in fields such as food delivery, ride hailing, cleaning or data entry activities. Surprisingly little is known about work and its manifestations on other platforms, despite the fact that the platform economy embraces a huge variety of arrangements for income generation. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 18 German (video)bloggers we show that (video)blogging constitutes a specific form of ‘digital self-employment’ that combines features of traditional self-employment with digitally mediated dependencies. While (video)bloggers enjoy both a great deal of independence from managerial control and a high degree of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, they are also subject to the rules and algorithms set by large tech companies. The example of (video)blogging, together with the experiences of (video)bloggers, highlights the extent to which the platform economy has created new types of work that need to be taken into consideration to enable a deeper understanding of the evolving dynamics of the platform economy and how these are transforming the nature of work.</p>

<p>In many parts of the economy, technology plays an increasingly important role in the control and management of workers. In this presenter symposium, we bring together four studies that offer novel insight into different dimensions of the relationship between technology and work, including behavioral experiments, identity control, the importance of social and cultural context, and effects for professional identity and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Our studies taken together show the importance of technology in a wide range of settings—platform-mediated work, such as ride-hailing and software development, platform-work, such as <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Instagram</span> influencers, and professional work performed in labor and delivery wards. By offering examinations of the intersections between technology and control in a variety of work contexts, both newer and more traditional, using both quantitative and qualitative methods, our symposium promises novel insights into the evolving and future role of technology in relationship between work and workers.

<p>Abstract Older adults’ <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use has been shown to be a double-edged sword, linked to health and social benefits but also creating vulnerabilities. Similarly, the use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span>s and other <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>ies (ICTs) in organizations also affords workers advantages, such as increased flexibility, while exposing them to risks such as exhaustion and distress. This research examines older workers’ <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use and identifies a contextual characteristic that may buffer the negative implications of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use for work purposes. Following the job demands–resources (JD-R) model, we hypothesized that older workers’ daily work-related <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use is positively related to their experienced stress and negatively related to their mood, and that these relationships would be attenuated by work scheduling <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. We conducted an experience sampling method (ESM) study with a sample of 38 workers (ages 50–64) who completed daily measures over 8 days, and tracked their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use objectively using screenshots of time spent using various apps. Contrary to our expectations, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use was not significantly related to stress or mood. There were significant cross-level interactions, such that <span style="background-color:lightgreen">smartphone</span> use for work was negatively related to experienced stress and positively related to a positive mood for those with lower levels of scheduling <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. We interpret these findings and discuss the effects that technology use for work may have on older workers’ well-being through the lens of the JD-R model. Our results suggest that ICT use in the workplace combined with work scheduling <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> may not be advantageous for workers’ well-being.</p>

<p>The workplace in the 21st century has changed dramatically, as the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> connected the world, the “gig economy” changed work arrangements, globalization expanded the job market and individual work values such as <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and freedom became dominant (Rabenu, 2021). Just a few years ago, automation and technology were the heart of the conversation on the modern workplace and seemed to be replacing meaningful human connections. However, the COVID-19 pandemic, that required social distancing, demonstrated just how much people still need each other, and how technology cannot replace human relationships. The Positive Organizational Scholarship (POS) movement that started in the early 2000’s seeks to understand the role of positive relationships at work. The place of work in our lives makes it a source of meaning, purpose and identity-building, that are often created through positive relationships (Ragins &amp; Dutton, 2007). For example, high-quality relationships enable human flourishing that in turn benefits the organization (Dutton &amp; Heaphy, 2003). Another notable outcome of the movement is the Reflected Best Self Exercise (Quinn, Dutton, Spreitzer, &amp; Roberts, 2003) that helps understand individual strengths through feedback from significant others. The purpose of this symposium is to contribute to understanding the role of positive relationships in the workplace. This collection of papers explores different types of work relationships with leaders, coworkers and work friends to examine how positive emotional connections help overcome challenges and promote well-being. By looking at processes on different levels of analysis, this symposium offers a broader perspective on workplace relations and unique roles they can play for employees and for organizations.

<p>Objective: This study examines how the organizational structure - mechanistic or organic - and exploration and exploration can contribute to explaining the radical and incremental innovations in research and development institutes (PD) of technology, aimed at products and services related to the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>, software, hardware, telecommunications (Telecom), information technology (IT) and automation.Methodology: The research was carried out in two phases: Qualitative with four case studies, two cases of national institutes, one private and one public, and two multinational private institutes located in Brazil. The quantitative used a closed questionnaire applied to 17 institutions.Originality / Relevancy: A justification for the selection of TRDI based on the fact that the literature on exploration, exploitation, organizational structure, and innovation shows that the areas of PD of organizations, as well as high technology businesses, must be structured organically. Due to the need for decentralization, more fluid communications, greater <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, and the creation of knowledge are necessary as you flourish in turbulent and unstable environments.Main results: The results will reveal a predominance of the organic model in 19 two 21 institutes studied, using both stages. However, it seems that, despite strong guidance for the organic model, there are elements of the mechanistic model: the ability to combine bureaucracy will lose the necessary flexibility. This study reveals that when two models of organizational structures and exploration and exploitation are discussed, there is a gap between theory and application.Theoretical/methodological contributions: The study describes the analysis of the position of institutes in relation to obtaining, generating, and implementing expertise, examining how their organizational structures are configured to carry out related activities in a suitable way for exploration, exploration, and development of innovation in development. you root and increase.Social contributions / for management: In practical terms, this study is relevant because it allows managers and government institutions to establish and implement innovative policies and procedures in this type of technology center. These implications are related to decision-making processes, knowledge creation, guidance for exploration, exploration, ambidexterity, and types of innovation. Consequently, it can be presumed that the organizational structure of these orientations can be mixed. By these arguments, we understand that innovation, ambidexterity (exploration and exploitation), and organizational structure have a strong relationship.</p>

<p>Purpose Organizations use enterprise <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> (ESM) platforms to operate, function, and develop. However, the effectiveness of the use of ESM is inconclusive. This study aims to explore the mechanism and boundary conditions of the relationship between employee ESM use and job performance. Design/methodology/approach This study uses a 2-wave survey design, with a final sample of 481 employees from a large automobile company. Findings The results indicate that ESM use is beneficial and detrimental to job performance. On the one hand, ESM use is positively related to work overload, decreasing job performance. On the other hand, ESM use is positively associated with informational support, increasing job performance. A mediation test revealed that both work overload and informational support mediate the relationship between ESM use and job performance. Furthermore, job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> weakens the positive relationship between ESM use and work overload, but strengthens the positive relationship between ESM use and informational support. Originality/value This study provides a more balanced view of how ESM use influences job performance by demonstrating the opposing mediating roles of work overload and informational support. Further, this study fills a research gap by considering job characteristics when examining the boundary conditions of ESM use. Third, this study validates the generalization of the job demands-resources model in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> research.</p>

<p>Digitalization and demographic change represent two megatrends that impact organizations and workplaces around the globe. Rapid developments in <span style="background-color:lightgreen">information and communication technolog</span>y (ICT) are fundamentally changing the ways in which work is conducted. At the same time, workforces are becoming increasingly older and age diverse. Integrating the model of workplace ICT use and work design with socioemotional selectivity theory from the lifespan development literature, we investigate employee age as a moderator of the indirect and total effects of ICT use for task and social functions on self-rated task proficiency and job satisfaction. As potential mediators, we focus on three job-related resources: job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, team cohesion, and task significance. Data were collected from 1761 employees at three measurement points across two months. The results showed that ICT use for task and social functions were not significantly associated with job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, team cohesion, task significance, task proficiency, and job satisfaction, while controlling for baseline levels of these mediator and outcome variables. Job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> was negatively related to task proficiency, and team cohesion was positively related, whereas both job <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and team cohesion were positively related to job satisfaction. Contrary to expectations, age did not moderate the indirect and total effects of ICT use for task and social functions on task proficiency and job satisfaction. We discuss the implications of our findings for future research and practice regarding ICT use and age in the work context.</p>
