<p>Abstract Successful <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> networks motivate people to engage in behaviors that speak to their most basic psychological needs through citizenship in a virtual society. These environments provide individuals with the ability to build relationships (relatedness), exercise competence, and express <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Recipes for satisfying these basic needs are vital to the success of virtual societies. This research contributes to existing literature by framing <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> interaction using the self-determination theory (SDT); the study analyzes a sample of 570 social networking participants using the generations of baby boomers, generation X, and millennials with fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). Findings indicate that affinity, belonging, interactivity, and innovativeness are all base expectations for <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span> networking usage, depending on the generational cohort. Indeed, understanding the motivational needs of unique generational cohorts allows marketers to more effectively design precise adaptive strategies for their <span style="background-color:lightgreen">social media</span>, which can impact engagement and thereby loyalty.</p>

<p>The reform of college English teaching is being undertaken in a way that adapts to the interest and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of individual student.Constructivism and modern network respectively render this new teaching mode theoretical and technical support.Through constructing perfect network environment,strengthening <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>space-learning supervisory system and taking diversified evaluating measures,teachers can effectively arouse and maintain learners’ subjectivity and initiative.</p>

<p>Vocational technical colleges should establish a new English teaching mode which caters for student’s individual learning and autonomous learning.According to the theory of modern educational technology and the humanistic concept of teaching and learning,such a new teaching mode should be composed of multi-media aided classroom teaching mode,students’ autonomous learning mode on the basis of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>,institutionalized after-class activities and a supervising evaluating system which emphasize the learning process.</p>

<p>In the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> society,the power of the traditional legitimizing identity declines and requirements for the evaluation of social identity are much higher. The <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the construction of social identity has become more prominent. As resistance identity and project identity rise,legitimizing identity is under challenge. Construction of social identity in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> society is a process of organizing different meanings and values,among which ideology occupies a central position. In the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> society,ideology has shifted from a rational type to a perceptual one,therefore perceptual ideology occupies a central position in the construction of social identity. Perceptual ideology,rooted in the human heart,empowers social identity on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>,which is reflected by the power hidden in the grass-roots society.</p>

<p>The proliferation of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> has given opportunities on different entities to share resources or conduct business transactions. However, how to establish trust among strangers without prior relationship and common security domain poses much difficulty for these activities. To resolve these problems, a promising approach known as Automated Trust Negotiation (ATN), which establishes the trust between strangers with iterative disclosure of credentials and access control policies, is proposed. In this paper, a comprehensive survey of research on ATN is presented, and some basic techniques, e.g.&nbsp;negotiation model and architecture, access control policy specification, credential description and credential chain discovery, are introduced and compared. Then based on the analysis of the shortcomings and problems of the techniques, the trend of research and application is discussed. All these work may contribute to the further work on trust establishment for entities with privacy protection and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in open <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>.</p>

<p>Mary Hemingway Rees died in 1954, some time before many of us here had the opportunity to know her, or the World Federation for Mental Health. Those of us who did not know her are so much the poorer. There is always too little of courage and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, grace and tranquility in this present world, qualities that Mrs.&nbsp;Rees possessed and was possessed by. In these two decades since her death, our world has become quite unlike the world she knew. Still those qualities of life she achieved are the same each of us would strive for. Her personality and career being what they were, the choice of subject for these memorial lectures is especially appropriate: values in mental health. However, there is no way, given what has happened in psychology and in religious affairs, for that subject to be approached in a fashion similar to the first lecture given by Dr.&nbsp;Henry Dicks. For example, it was just two years before Mary Rees’s death that I had my first training experience in a mental hospital, and I recall sitting in general case conferences with all of us attempting to get acquainted with and accustomed to the most recent change in nomenclature for behavioral syndromes. What was new then has now been replaced more than once. This was all before the era of the Esalen Institutes, Carl Rogers’s second phase, humanistic psychology, Ida Rolf, sensitivity training, the Primal Scream, Gestalt therapy, behavior modifica tion, and, of course, transactional analysis, to say nothing of the revolution by the psy<span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>ropic chemicals and the broad use of hallucinogenic drugs. In this same period, on the spiritual side, the Reverend Mr.&nbsp;Robinson helped us see that God is dead in his book Honest to God. The churches came to be characterized as museums of man’s past, and deluded, experience. Spiritual truth came to us in the West from the East, the flower children appeared on the scene with transcendental meditation, and the worldwide revolution of youth thrust us into a paroxysm of protest</p>

<i> Yang Zhong-qi </i></p>
<p>Digitalization wave is unprecedentedly bringing both opportunities and challenges to Chinese sci-tech journal development.Getting off to a late start though rapidly developing,the digitalization of sci-tech journals in China needs to be constantly perfected in editing and publishing mode,information renewing management,web design,extension and development of content,etc.For example,the journals which own self-built webs take shortage of necessary human,financial and material resources;the journals which are connected to the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> with the help of sci-tech information network or data base are restricted with fixed model and lack of independence and <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.Moreover,the digitalization of the sci-tech journals in China has difficulties in development.For example,there have been no unified standards or regulation yet;it is getting harder and harder to protect copyright;and preserving and copying the back issues of a journal becomes fragile.It is suggested that impetus be given to the digitalization of the sci-tech journals in China by pushing on innovations in journal system and mechanism,carrying out digitalized editing and publishing modes,exploring for successful commercialized operation modes,and practicing internationalized academic regulations.</p>

<p>In EFL classrooms,teachers have gradually adopted the CLT approach focusing on meaning and language use,due to the linier feature of face-to-face interaction,the learning outcome is still not efficient enough.EFL teachers now urgently need a solution to increase exposure and use of the target knowledge both inside and outside of the classroom.This paper assumes that the integration of CMC(Computer Mediated Communication) into EFL learning can provide learners with more authentic input and more opportunities to participate in the target sociocultural contexts;both linguistic and pragmatic knowledge can be promoted.Moreover,motivation,learners’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and equal opportunities for output can also be encouraged through the use of CMC inside and outside of the classroom.</p>

<p>Introduction Recruitment of young doctors into psychiatry is declining in many countries, which might become a threat to the survival of the profession. Objectives To identify potential reasons for this threat. Aims To look at psychiatry with concepts used by the sociology of professions. Methods Professions are characterized –&nbsp;and these concept will be used for analysis here&nbsp;– by (1) ownership of a specialized body of knowledge and skills, which defines the field of competence and the scope of potential clients, including the demarcation from other professions; (2) holding a high status in society; (3) being granted <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> by society, e.g.&nbsp;in recruiting and excluding members; and (4) being obliged, in return for the above, to guarantee high quality standards in providing services and following ethical rules. Results Six intertwined areas of concern are identified: three of them, the increasing criticism by users and carers, the intrusion of other professions, and psychiatry’s negative image in society, can be traced back to problems with the other three concerning the “ownership of a specialized body of knowledge and skills”. With the preparation and advent of DSM-5, discussions about the lack of validity of psychiatric disease entities have gone viral in the time of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>. The attempts to “carve nature at its joints” have failed, and this is more and more perceived from outside, threatening psychiatry’s status in society and potentially turning away to be psychiatrists. Conclusion Looking at psychiatry as a profession may help to better understand its current situation.</p>

Neither general nor abstract concepts of character take into account the concrete experience of a book. Fourth, character study seems to ignore the real object of criticism and teaching which is to try to understand the moral vision of the ‘7Leon Surmelian, Techniques of Fiction Writing: Measure and Madness (Garden City, New York: Doubleday and Co., Inc., 1968), p.&nbsp;139.

Fifth, character study deflects attention from the unity of the total work to see the part as larger than the whole. For example, a character study might take into account Hamlet the prince rather than Hamlet the play. Sixth, character study tends to deny the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of the created artifact and confuse real emotions with aesthetic emotions.’ Finally, many authors discourage character study by propagating the attitude that literary characters are mysterious gifts given them from some unknown source. All of these criticisms might be divided into two categories. The idea that reading a work of literature is only an aesthetic experience and should never be confused with an emotional experience is expressed in the first and sixth reasons given for avoiding character study. The other five criticisms of character study have to do generally with the idea that at its best character study is good description which nonetheless does not fulfill the critical task, or that, at its worst, it attempts to be analytical but fails because it does not bridge the gap between character itself and the relation of character to the work as a whole and to the reading experience. From a psychological perspective, character is not separate from the work as a whole. Rather, character is intricately and necessarily woven into the texture of a work. Thus, character expresses and is expressive of style, content, themes, imagery and ultimately is the purveyor of the intellectual and emotional rhythms of the author’s vision. From this viewpoint, character becomes a viable and even necessary focus for serious literary criticism and teaching. Character, seen as the driving force in fiction, as the purveyor of intellectual and emotional rhythms in the work, thus typifies the mimetic view of literature which sees no final discontinuity between a reader’s responses to art and to life. Within a mimetic perspective, a reader does not merely have a reading experience; he is the reading experience and the work becomes the reader’s experience of it. 9 ’ W. J. Harvey, Character and the Novel (London: <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Chat</span>to and Windus, 1965), p.&nbsp;206. ’9To further clarify the mimetic view of the reading experience, it is worthwhile to cite a comment made about the ideas of existential psychologist, Harry S. Sullivan: What we are asked to accept [by Harry S. Sullivan] is that in quite a real sense the self [reader] is one’s personal relationships. We have tended in the past to suppose that we are self-contained individuals looking out from a tower in our own private castle from which we proceed on periodic excursions in order to satisfy physical, emotional and mental needs and desires. We assumed that our contacts with the world left us relatively untouched, the same person as before. In the opinion of Sullivan this is a complete fallacy.

<p>Introduction. The ToLigado Project Your School Interactive Newspaper is an interactive virtual learning environment conceived, developed, implemented and supported by researchers at the School of the Future Research Laboratory of the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Method. This virtual learning environment aims to motivate trans-disciplinary research among public school students and teachers in 2,931 schools equipped with <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>-access computer rooms. Within this virtual community, students produce collective multimedia research documents that are immediately published in the portal. The project also aims to increase students’ <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> for research, collaborative work and Web authorship. Main sections of the portal are presented and described. Results. Partial results of the first two years’ implementation are presented and indicate a strong motivation among students to produce knowledge despite the fragile hardware and software infrastructure at the time. Discussion. In this new environment, students should be seen as ‘knowledge architects’ and teachers as facilitators, or ‘curiosity managers’. The ToLigado portal may constitute a repository for future studies regarding student attitudes in virtual learning environments, students’ behaviour as ‘authors’, Web authorship involving collective knowledge production, teachers’ behaviour as facilitators, and virtual learning environments as digital repositories of students’ knowledge construction and social capital in virtual learning communities.

<p>This study elucidates the experiential and motivational aspects of online health information beyond the theoretically limited instrumental perspective that dominates the extant literature. Based on a sample of 993 online health information seekers in India, the survey found that online health information seeking offers individuals greater <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness compared to face-to-face office visits with physicians. According to self-determination theory, individuals are motivated to act by a sense of volition and experience of willingness, validation of one’s skills and competencies, and feeling of connection with others who shaped one’s decisions. These 3 psychological needs, which motivate individuals to pursue what they innately seek as human beings, help explain why individuals turn online for health information. T tests showed that all 3 self-determination theory constructs -<span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, competence, and relatedness-were higher for online health information seeking than for face-to-face office visits with physicians. A regression analysis found that 2 variables, <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and relatedness, explained online health information seeking. Competence was not a significant factor, likely because of competency issues faced by individuals in interpreting, understanding, and making use of online health information. The findings, which do not suggest that online health information seeking would displace physicians as many have feared, offer promise for an integrated system of care. Office visits with physicians would necessarily evolve into an expanded communicative space of health information seeking instead of an alternative channel for health information.</p>

<p>Nursing patients during labor and delivery is a demanding and challenging experience. There are many things nurses must learn in order to do this; they learn to make specific observations about the progress of labor, and the well-being of mother and infant, they learn specific activities which provide comfort to the mother, they teach and reinforce earlier knowledge about the birth process, breathing and relaxation techniques, and so on. One kind of nursing skill, needed in many areas in which nurses function, may be developed particularily well in this area. This is the minute-by-minute assessment of the patient’s state, and adaptation of nursing care to this. A surgical patient may move from self-sufficient independence, to helplessness, to gradually regained <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> over a period of days or weeks. The obstetrical patient may pass through these stages in a matter of hours. Thus the nurse must operate on the basis of the patient’s behavior, as she sees it, at any point in time; she cannot make a plan of care and follow it for a long period. Rather, she has certain objectives relating to safety, well-being, comfort, physiological stability and so on, but she must continually make adaptations in ways of trying to attain these. Picture a hypothetical patient who arrives in the labor room in early labor. She is full of energy, talkative, happy. She is aware of what is going on in her body, and interested in observing her own progress. She times her own contractions, <span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>s with her husband and the nurses, perhaps knits, walks about, telephones friends. She has</p>

<p>Contemporary research in artificial environments has marked the need for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in artificial agents. <span style="background-color:cyan">Autonomy</span> has many interpretations in terms of the field within which it is being used and analyzed, but the majority of the researchers in artificial environments are arguing in favor of a strong and life-like notion of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Departing from this point the main aim of this paper is to examine the possibility of the emergence of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in contemporary artificial agents. The theoretical findings of research in the areas of living and cognitive systems, suggests that the study of autonomous agents should adopt a systemic and emergent perspective for the analysis of the evolutionary development of the notions/properties of <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, functionality, intentionality and meaning, as the fundamental and characteristic properties of a natural agent. An analytic indication of the functional emergence of these concepts and properties is provided, based on the characteristics of the more general systemic framework of second-order <span style="background-color:lightgreen">cyber</span>netic and of the interactivist framework. The notion of emergence is a key concept in such an analysis which in turn provides the ground for the theoretical evaluation of the <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> of contemporary artificial agents with respect to the functional emergence of their capacities. The fundamental problems for the emergence of genuine <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in artificial agents are critically discussed and some design guidelines are provided.</p>

<p>Management of digital identity involves every company and institution, not only in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> world. Among different identity management models, only the federated one is able to ensure a strong protection in terms of trust and privacy. In fact, the participants in the federation decide to trust each other about which information can be exchanged in the processes of authentication and authorisation, based on established policies to manage relationships of trust. According to this, it has been widely adopted during the last years. In particular, its adoption in Public Administration allows a proper organisation <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, supporting access to the services offered by the institution. This process is going to quickly raise with the progressive adoption of cloud computing by Public Administrations. In the paper, two projects accomplishing federated digital identity in Italian Public Administrations are presented. Starting from lessons learned, authors highlight a path forward for Public Administration toward federated digital identity in cloud computing scenario.</p>

<p>In the literature, uses of the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> by patients are interpreted either as a resource supporting their <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, or as a source of perturbation in the doctor-patient relationship. Analysing 50 interviews with pregnant women, this article aims at describing the different uses made during pregnancy. Some women mostly aim at sharing their experience in their use of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span>. Others are looking for specialised information, by curiosity, to complement the information received in medical visits or, more rarely, as a result of a lack of information in their exchanges with professionals. Uses of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> by patients will develop in the future and it is important that professionals take into account these different forms of <span style="background-color:lightgreen">internet</span> use in their practices.</p>

<p>AbstractThe media landscape has changed dramatically in recent decades, from one predominated by traditional mass communication formats to today’s more personalised network environment. <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Social network site</span>s, online games, video-sharing sites, and gadgets such as iPods and <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span>s are now fixtures of youth culture. They have so permeated young lives that it is hard to believe that less than a decade ago these technologies barely existed. Today’s youth are struggling for <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> and identity as did their predecessors, but they are doing so amid new worlds for communication, friendship, play, and self-expression. This paper seeks to provide empirical data on the impact of the mobile technology on the social life of Indian youth. Taking a survey of some 1200 young Indians, the paper discovers their dependency on this new medium.</p>

<p>The majority of the extensive debate surrounding posthumous sperm procurement (PSP) focuses on how to respect the deceased man and his <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>. Policy and law also focus on the deceased’s interests, specifying the level of consent required. This article argues (using four hypothetical fact situations) that consent should not be the sole focus of ethical debate. Instead, a fuller picture should be examined, including the wishes and values of the prospective sperm donor; the future life and prospects of the resultant child; the needs and motivations of the mother, and other pertinent factors. In practice, this means that a committee acting judicially should consider each case. This is a practical option for New Zealand and Australia where applications for posthumous sperm procurement are not common but it also enables us to consider the ethical arguments in relation to such determinations in other jurisdictions.</p>

<p>Prior research shows that students use the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> as a main source of health information. When starting college, students get greater <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> over their behaviors and responsibility for their own health, which creates a number of health-related information needs. As a result of this newly acquired <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>, students also frequently engage in various risky behaviors, putting their well-being in jeopardy. This study aimed to answer whether the self-reported frequency in which students engage in risky behaviors and their enrollment in health-related courses affect how frequently they obtain health-related information. A novel aspect of this study is that it incorporated both intentional and opportunistic information acquisition. An analysis of online survey responses from 810 undergraduates attending a mid-western U.S. university showed that the frequency of their engagement in risky behaviors (e.g., the use of substances and alcohol and engagement in high-risk sexual activities) is not significantly associated with the frequency of neither intentional nor opportunistic health information acquisition on the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>. However, students enrolled in health-related courses more frequently obtain health information by both intentional search and opportunistic discovery. This opportunistic style of was often described in the literature using terms such as passive, unintentional, accidental, serendipitous, encountering or acquiring by chance. The study findings provide valuable directions for librarians and health educators on how to design new and improve existing e-health literacy instructions to better suit students’ current needs and information behavior patterns.</p>

<p>The ever-growing percentage of elderly people in developed countries have made Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) solutions an important subject to be explored and developed. The increase in geriatric care requests are overburdening specialized institutions that cannot cope with the demand for support. Patients are forced to have to remain at their homes encumbering the spouse or close family members with the caregiver role. This caregiver is not always physically and technically apt to assist the bedridden person with his/her meals and hygiene/bath routine. Consequently, a solution to assist caregivers in these tasks is of the utmost importance. This paper presents an approach for supporting caregivers when moving and repositioning Bedridden Elderly Peoples (BEPs) in home settings by means of a me<span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>ronic system inspired by industrial conveyers. The proposed solution is able to insert itself underneath the patient, due to its low-profile structural properties, and retrieve and reallocate him/her. Ideally, the proposed me<span style="background-color:lightgreen">chat</span>ronic system aims to promote <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> by reducing handling complexity, alter the role of the caregiver from physically handler of the BEP to an operator/supervisor role, and lessen the amount of effort expended by caregivers and BEPs alike.</p>

<p>Kenyans use mobile money services to transfer money to friends and relatives via <span style="background-color:lightgreen">mobile phone</span> text messaging. Kenya’s M-Pesa is one of the most successful examples of digital money for financial inclusion. This article uses social network analysis and ethnographic information to examine ties to and through women in 12 mobile money transfer networks of kin, drawn from field data collected in 2012, 2013, and 2014. The social networks are based on reciprocal and dense ties among siblings and parents, especially mothers. Men participate equally in social networks, but as brothers and mother’s brothers more often than as fathers. The matrilineal ties of mobile money circulate value within the hearthhold (Ekejiuba 2005) of women, their children, and others connected to them. Using remittances, families negotiate investments in household farming or work, education, and migration. Money sending supports the diverse economic strategies, flexible kinship ties, and mobility of hearthholds. Gifts of e-money are said to express a natural love and caring among mothers and siblings and are often private and personal. Consequently, the money circulations of the hearthhold avoid disrupting widely shared ideals of patrilineal solidarity and household <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>.</p>

<p>This chapter examines the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>’s origins and development as a ‘freedom-enhancing’ tool, alongside the contemporaneous evolution of EU law and regulation governing private economic power. The concept linking these two streams of discussion is that of ‘user <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span>’, which is implicated by the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span>’s affordances for individuals, and which, it is argued, should also be the legal and regulatory framework’s goal when governing <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> matters. However, the trends influencing EU law and regulation from the 1980s, especially neoliberalism, have resulted in these frameworks - competition law, sector-specific regulation, data protection and fundamental rights - not being well-equipped to advance user <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> in the <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> sphere.</p>

<p>Changes in the German medical licensing law in 2002 demanded the inclusion of sound scientific knowledge and practical skills in the medical education programme for undergraduates. The universities were given ample <span style="background-color:cyan">autonomy</span> to implement this goal, so that subjects not yet included in the curricula, such as Evidence-based Medicine (EbM), could now be integrated in the study course. Hence, in 2003 the Medical Faculty of the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University, Frankfurt/Germany implemented (as first institution) a mandatory clinical training in EbM for third-year medical students. The content and structure of the seminar are based on the “Curriculum EbM” of the German Network of Evidence-Based Medicine. This project is conducted exclusively by intern medical students with previous training in teaching skills and specific knowledge. The seminar is integrated in the interdisciplinary field “Epidemiology, biostatistics, and informatics”. The four-day seminars consist of lectures and small-group teaching based on <span style="background-color:lightgreen">Internet</span> search of medical information as well as on the critical appraisal of studies that deal with therapeutic and diagnostic problems; the self-evaluation of the information-retrieval process is also included. Special importance is attached to the need of scrutinising published medical information. The grades are based on seminar-oriented tests as well as on end-of-term examinations. The Frankfurt project shows that EbM can be easily implemented in medical undergraduate courses.</p>
